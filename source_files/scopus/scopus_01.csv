The other region, which is localised at the fusion peptide, could potentially function as a pan-SARS target.

Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen’s nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,"Cell Death Discov.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085530102

As the immune response to the vaccine shows some degree of cross-antigenicity, the vaccine also affects a level of resistance to a range of unrelated diseases and pathogens. Clinical studies data have shown that the BCG vaccine has effects on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Although the vaccine does not possess any inherent antiviral activity, it engages in the host immune system such that many types of viral infections are considerably reduced. Hence, we expect that the frequency and severity of many microbial diseases, including COVID-19, will be lower in counties in which mass BCG vaccination programs are implemented. So the BCG vaccine may prove useful in the coming months especially in countries where already have mass BCG vaccination, as the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health services across the world. Currently, countless front-line healthcare staff is in immediate danger of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, as oral zinc sulfate as immunomodulator has proved an effective means to treat various viral diseases (including viral warts and herpes), parasitic infections, and diseases with autoimmune reactions such as Behcet’s disease and recurrent aphthous stomatitis, it could be employed in combination with the BCG vaccine to enhance the immunological functions of patients with COVID-19. So BCG immunotherapy combined with oral zinc sulfate will be encouraging protective programs in societies where coronavirus is going to spread. © 2020 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum Ltd., UK.","BCG; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Zinc sulfate","BCG vaccine; corticosteroid; immunomodulating agent; zinc; zinc sulfate; antiviral activity; aphthous stomatitis; arthralgia; Article; autoimmune disease; BCG vaccination; bladder carcinoma; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease severity; fever; herpes simplex keratitis; human; immune response; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; leprosy; multiple sclerosis; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; skin leishmaniasis; tuberculosis",,"Electro.

Hence, immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are introduced rapidly without requiring FDA emergency use authorization approval. Thus, evaluation of test performance predominantly relies on laboratories. This study aimed to evaluate the test performance of recently launched commercial immunoassays in serum and plasma samples. Methods: 51 serum samples from 26 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after end of quarantine and 25 control patients were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope to assess diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. 20 matching pairs of serum and plasma samples were included to analyze comparability between different specimens. Results: Overall, a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3%, 96.2–100% and 100% with a respective diagnostic specificity of 100%, 100% and 84–86% for the immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope were determined. In total, 84–96% of samples were correctly classified as negative and 92.3–95.2% as positive. The level of concordance between plasma- and serum-based testing diverged between the assays (Epitope r2 = 0.97; Euroimmun r2 = 0.91; Roche r2 = 0.76). Conclusions: The immunoassays from Euroimmun and Roche revealed a higher specificity than the Epitope assay without a substantial drop of diagnostic sensitivity. Significant differences between plasma- and serum-based testing highlights the need for determination of appropriate cut-offs per specimen type. Hence, there is an urgent need for test harmonization and establishment of quality standards for an appropriate use of COVID-19 serological tests. © 2020","Anti-SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Immunoassay; Method comparison; Roche; Serologic assay","immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; adult; aged; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; immunoassay; male; priority journal; quarantine; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","32652161","Clin.

We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs).

As viruses are intracellular obligate parasites, viral originated CPPs have been considered as suitable intracellular shuttling vectors for cargo transportation. A total of 310 CPPs were identified in the proteome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Screening the proteome of the cause of COVID-19 reveals that SARS-CoV-2 CPPs (SCV2-CPPs) span the regions involved in replication, protein-nucleotide and protein-protein interaction, protein-metal ion interaction, and stabilization of homo/hetero-oligomers. However, to find the most appropriate peptides as drug delivery vectors, one might face several hurdles. Computational analyses showed that 94.3% of the identified SCV2-CPPs are non-toxins, and 38% are neither antigenic nor allergenic. Interestingly, 36.70% of SCV2-CPPs were resistant to all four groups of protease families. Nearly 1/3 of SCV2-CPPs had sufficient inherent or induced helix and sheet conformation leading to increased uptake efficiency. Heliquest lipid-binding discrimination factor revealed that 44.30% of the helical SCV2-CPPs are lipid-binding helices. Although Cys-rich derived CPPs of helicase (NSP13) can potentially fold into a cyclic conformation in endosomes with a higher rate of endosomal release, the most optimal SCV2-CPP candidates as vectors for drug delivery were SCV2-CPP118, SCV2-CPP119, SCV2-CPP122, and SCV2-CPP129 of NSP12 (RdRp). Ten experimentally validated viral-derived CPPs were also used as the positive control to check the scalability and reliability of our protocol in SCV2-CPP retrieval. Some peptides with a cell-penetration ability known as bioactive peptides are adopted as biotherapeutics themselves. Therefore, 59.60%, 29.63%, and 32.32% of SCV2-CPPs were identified as potential antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungals, respectively. While 63.64% of SCV2-CPPs had immuno-modulatory properties, 21.89% were recognized as anti-cancers. Conclusively, the workflow of this study provides a platform for profound screening of viral proteomes as a rich source of biotherapeutics or drug delivery carriers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioactive peptide; Cell-penetrating peptide; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Drug delivery; SARS-CoV-2","cell penetrating peptide; M protein; membrane protein; nonstructural protein 1; nonstructural protein 10; nonstructural protein 11; nonstructural protein 12; nonstructural protein 13; nonstructural protein 14; nonstructural protein 15; nonstructural protein 16; nonstructural protein 2; nonstructural protein 3; nonstructural protein 4; nonstructural protein 5; nonstructural protein 6; nonstructural protein 7; nonstructural protein 8; nonstructural protein 9; nucleocapsid protein; protein ORF10; protein ORF3a; protein ORF6; protein ORF7a; protein ORF8; proteome; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus envelope protein; virus spike protein; Article; controlled study; drug delivery system; endosome; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; peptide analysis; physical chemistry; prediction; priority journal; protein conformation; protein interaction; protein secondary structure; proteomics; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pathogenesis; virus replication; virus transcription","32712315","Infec.

Several factors may increase intestinal permeability including direct enterocyte damage by SARS-CoV2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and epithelial ischemia secondary to SARS-CoV2- associated endothelial dysfunction. This increase permeability further leads to translocation of microbial components such as MAMPs (microbial-associated molecular pattern), triggering an inflammatory immune response by TLR-expressing cells of the mesentery fat (mostly macrophages and adipocytes).

Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena.

Due to the lack of specific medication and vaccination, drug-repurposing attempts has emerged as a promising approach and identified several human proteins interacting with the virus. This study aims to provide a comprehensive molecular profiling of the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13. Materials and methods: The list of immune cell-enriched proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from The Human Protein Atlas. Genomic alterations were identified using cBioPortal. Survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Analyses of protein expression and tumor infiltration levels were carried out by TIMER. Key findings: 14 human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in immune cells. Among these proteins, USP13 had the highest frequency of genomic alterations. Higher USP13 levels were correlated with improved survival in breast and lung cancers, while resulting in poor prognosis in ovarian and gastric cancers. Furthermore, copy number variations of USP13 significantly affected the infiltration levels of distinct subtypes of immune cells in head & neck, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers. Although our results suggested a tumor suppressor role for USP13 in lung cancer, in other cancers, its role seemed to be context-dependent. Significance: It is critical to identify and characterize human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 in order to have a better understanding of the disease and to develop better therapies/vaccines.

The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs). PNC formation increases neutrophil recruitment, activation priming and extraversion of these immune cells into inflamed pulmonary tissue, thereby contributing to ARDS. Sequestered PNCs cause the development of a procoagulant and proinflammatory environment. The contribution to ARDS of increased extracellular histone levels, circulating mitochondrial DNA, the chromatin protein HMGB1, decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired macrophage efferocytosis, the cytokine storm, the toll-like receptor radical cycle, pyroptosis, necroinflammation, lymphopenia and a high Th17 to regulatory T lymphocyte ratio are detailed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2; Treatment",,"32739471","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089233076

In this context, we have analyzed the anti-coronavirus potential of the natural product glycyrrhizic acid (GLR), a drug used to treat liver diseases (including viral hepatitis) and specific cutaneous inflammation (such as atopic dermatitis) in some countries. The properties of GLR and its primary active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid are presented and discussed. GLR has shown activities against different viruses, including SARS-associated Human and animal coronaviruses. GLR is a non-hemolytic saponin and a potent immuno-active anti-inflammatory agent which displays both cytoplasmic and membrane effects. At the membrane level, GLR induces cholesterol-dependent disorganization of lipid rafts which are important for the entry of coronavirus into cells. At the intracellular and circulating levels, GLR can trap the high mobility group box 1 protein and thus blocks the alarmin functions of HMGB1. We used molecular docking to characterize further and discuss both the cholesterol- and HMG box-binding functions of GLR. The membrane and cytoplasmic effects of GLR, coupled with its long-established medical use as a relatively safe drug, make GLR a good candidate to be tested against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, alone and in combination with other drugs. The rational supporting combinations with (hydroxy)chloroquine and tenofovir (two drugs active against SARS-CoV-2) is also discussed. Based on this analysis, we conclude that GLR should be further considered and rapidly evaluated for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cholesterol; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Glycyrrhizin; HMGB1; Natural product","alarmin; glycyrrhetinic acid; glycyrrhizic acid; high mobility group B1 protein; hydroxychloroquine; tenofovir; alternative medicine; antiinflammatory activity; antiviral activity; atopic dermatitis; combination drug therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; cytoplasm; disease association; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug safety; hepatitis virus; human; immune response; lipid raft; molecular docking; molecular weight; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory distress syndrome; Review; SARS coronavirus; virus replication","32592716","Pharmacol.

The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients.

Why these viruses can cause profound pathologies in humans, while natural reservoir hosts often show little evidence of disease is not completely understood. Differences in the host immune response, especially within the innate compartment, have been suggested to be involved in this divergence. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that play a critical role in the early antiviral response, secreting effector cytokines and clearing infected cells.

In the present investigation, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immunoinformatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous milieu aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel axial frequency distribution (AFD) analytical tool.

The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets. The rapidly expanding literature on COVID-19 should be interpreted with care as it is often hampered by methodological and statistical flaws. © 2020 The Author(s)","ACE2; Cancer; COVID-19; Cytokines; SARS-COV-2; TMPRSS2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 11; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 18; interleukin 33; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; protein TMPRSS2; serine proteinase; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; blood clotting disorder; cancer mortality; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; high risk patient; human; infection sensitivity; malignant neoplasm; morbidity; nonhuman; practice guideline; protein expression; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; therapy delay","32731090","Cancer Treat.

Additionally, general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting COVID-19 are addressed. This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection. Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main protease (Mpro) is available.

Accumulating evidence suggested that the progression of COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia and excessive inflammation, and a subset of severe cases might exhibit cytokine storm triggered by secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19. We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents.

Findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with a diffuse alveolar damage component, coupled with microvascular involvement with intra- and extravascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in nonhemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Multifocal acute injury of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the 3 Houston cases had evidence of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 g heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 g heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (670 g heart). All 3 subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65, and 35.2 Kg/m2). Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with coagulopathy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Autopsy; Coagulopathy; COVID-19; Diffuse alveolar damage; Heart; Kidney; Liver; SARS-CoV-2; Spleen; Viral pneumonia","fibrin; procoagulant; Article; autopsy; blood clotting disorder; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular system; China; clinical feature; congestive cardiomyopathy; coronavirus disease 2019; fibrin deposition; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle injury; histopathology; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; inflammatory cell; inflammatory infiltrate; interstitial pneumonia; lung arteriole; lung disease; lung embolism; lung hemorrhage; lung infarction; lymphocytic myocarditis; microthrombus; myocarditis; neutrophil; organizing pneumonia; pericarditis; priority journal; publication; respiratory system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systemic disease; Texas; thromboembolism; United States; virus pneumonia; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; cardiac muscle; cause of death; comorbidity; complication; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; female; health status; heart; heart disease; host pathogen interaction; lung; male; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; risk factor; very elderly; virology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Cause of Death; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Status; Heart; Heart Diseases; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; United States","32434133","Cardiovasc.

The symptoms vary from person to person and many are “hidden carriers.” Few people experience immediate reaction and even death within 48 h of infection. However, many show mild to chronic symptoms and recover. Nevertheless, the death rate due to COVID-19 transmission is high especially among patients with non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to consider vitamins as epigenetic modifiers to enhance immunity and reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients with non-communicable diseases. Recent Findings: Clinical evidence has suggested the risk of getting infected is high among individuals with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal disease, as well as the elderly with high mortality rate among the cohort. The impact is due to an already compromised immune system of patients. Every patient has a different response to COVID-19, which shows that the ability to combat the deadly virus varies individually. Thus, treatment can be personalized and adjusted to help protect and combat COVID-19 infections, especially in individuals with non-communicable diseases. Summary: Based on current published scientific and medical evidence, the suggestions made in this article for combination of vitamin therapy as epigenetic modifiers to control the unregulated inflammatory and cytokine marker expressions, further needs to be clinically proven. Future research and clinical trials can apply the suggestions given in this article to support metabolic activities in patients and enhance the immune response. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Immunotherapy; Non-communicable disease; Pandemic; Vitamin",,"32661859","Curr.

Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Neurodegeneration; Proteasome; Proteasome inhibitors; SARS-Cov-2","19s proteasome; 20s proteasome; aminophenazone; antineoplastic metal complex; bortezomib; carfilzomib; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; delanzomib; deubiquitinase; fatty acid; holoenzyme; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; ixazomib; natural product; oncoprotein; oprozomib; p21 activated kinase; porphyrin; proteasome; proteasome inhibitor; protein p27; protein p53; protein serine threonine kinase inhibitor; salinosporamide A; ubiquitin protein ligase; unclassified drug; biochemical analysis; biogenesis; cancer growth; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; clinical pharmacology; coronavirus disease 2019; degenerative disease; drug mechanism; drug repositioning; drug structure; drug targeting; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; enzyme regulation; enzyme structure; human; Huntington chorea; malignant neoplasm; metabolic regulation; neuropathology; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein assembly; protein homeostasis; regulatory mechanism; retina disease; Review","32442437","Pharmacol.

Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain. Material and methods: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. Results: Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR = 7.701, 95%CI:1.265–46.893, P = 0.027), eosinopenia (OR = 5.595, 95%CI:1.008–31.054, P = 0.049), and worse one-month outcome (OR = 8.984; 95%CI:1.021–79.061, P = 0.048). Conclusion: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment. Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Blood routine test; COVID-19; Lymphocytes subsets; Peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs); Severe type","adult; aged; Article; basophil count; blood analysis; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; clinical article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease classification; disease exacerbation; disease severity; eosinopenia; eosinophil count; female; human; inflammatory cell; lymphocyte count; lymphocyte subpopulation; lymphocytopenia; male; neutrophil count; peripheral blood stem cell; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; Betacoronavirus; blood; cell count; Coronavirus infection; eosinophil; lymphocytopenia; middle aged; monocyte; natural killer cell; neutrophil; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; pathophysiology; prognosis; severity of illness index; survival analysis; virology; virus pneumonia; biological marker; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Cell Count; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Eosinophils; Female; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphocyte Subsets; Lymphopenia; Male; Middle Aged; Monocytes; Neutrophils; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis","32417210","Clin.

A distinct phenotype was observed in severe and critical patients, consisting of a highly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response (characterized by no IFN-β and low IFN-α production and activity), which was associated with a persistent blood viral load and an exacerbated inflammatory response. Inflammation was partially driven by the transcriptional factor nuclear factor-κB and characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 production and signaling. These data suggest that type I IFN deficiency in the blood could be a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and provide a rationale for combined therapeutic approaches.

Methods: Pooled plasma samples from PCR positive COVID-19 patients were used to identify linear B-cell epitopes from a SARS-CoV-2 peptide library of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins by peptide-based ELISA. Hit epitopes were further validated with 79 COVID-19 patients with different disease severity status, 13 seasonal human CoV, 20 recovered SARS patients and 22 healthy donors. Findings: Four immunodominant epitopes, S14P5, S20P2, S21P2 and N4P5, were identified on the S and N viral proteins. IgG responses to all identified epitopes displayed a strong detection profile, with N4P5 achieving the highest level of specificity (100%) and sensitivity (>96%) against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the magnitude of IgG responses to S14P5, S21P2 and N4P5 were strongly associated with disease severity. Interpretation: IgG responses to the peptide epitopes can serve as useful indicators for the degree of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients, and function as higly specific and sensitive sero-immunosurveillance tools for recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infections. The flexibility of these epitopes to be used alone or in combination will allow for the development of improved point-of-care-tests (POCTs).

The number of victims continues to increase, and patients at risk can only be protected to a degree, because the virulent state may be asymptomatic. Risk factors concerning COVID-19–induced morbidity and mortality include advanced age, an impaired immune system, cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer treated with chemotherapy. Here, we discuss the risk and impact of COVID-19 in patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. Because no published data are yet available, expert opinions are, by necessity, based on case experience and reports from patients. Although the overall risk to acquire the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may not be elevated in mast cell disease, certain conditions may increase the risk of infected patients to develop severe COVID-19. These factors include certain comorbidities, mast cell activation–related events affecting the cardiovascular or bronchopulmonary system, and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, such treatments should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis during a COVID-19 infection. In contrast, other therapies, such as anti–mediator-type drugs, venom immunotherapy, or vitamin D, should be continued. Overall, patients with mast cell disorders should follow the general and local guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic and advice from their medical provider. © 2020 The Authors","coronavirus; COVID-19; KIT D816V; mast cell activation syndrome; Mast cells; mastocytosis; SARS-CoV-2; tryptase","Article; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; disease severity; human; immune system; infection risk; lymphatic system disease; mast cell; mast cell activation syndrome; mastocytosis; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; priority journal; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; virus transmission","32561389","J.

There is currently great interest in drug repositioning to manage SARS-CoV-2 infection, that is, the evaluation of the potential benefits of a drug that has already been proven safe and effective in humans for other approved indications. As interleukin-6 (IL-6) acts as a key driver of the inflammation associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), IL-6 and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) inhibition appear to be promising targets for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

In general, newly presenting patients should be assessed, and patients rece ntly receiving chemotherapy, targeted therapy or radionuclide therapy, or showing tumour growth, should be close ly followed. For previously diagnosed patients, who have indolent disease, some delay in routine follow-up or t reatment may not be problematic. However, patients developing acute secretory syndromes due to functional neuroend ocrine neoplasms (such as of the pancreas, intestine or lung), phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, will require prompt treatment. Patients with lifethreatening Covid-19-related symptoms should be urgently treated and long-term anti-tumoral treatments may be temporarily delayed. In patients with especially aggressive NEN s, a careful judgement should be made regarding the severity of any Covid-19 illness, tumour grade, and the immunos uppressant effects of any planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy (e.g. interferon-alpha), targeted therapy or related treatment. In other cases, especially patients with completely resected NENs, or who are under surveillance for a g enetic disorder, a telephone or delayed consultation may be in order, balancing the risk of a delay against that of the possible development of Covid-19. © 2020 European Society of Endocrinology.",,"Article; bronchus carcinoid; cancer therapy; collaborative care team; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic imaging; disease surveillance; endocrine surgery; gastrinoma; gastrointestinal tumor; human; insulinoma; large intestine tumor; neuroendocrine tumor; neurosurgery; pancreas islet cell tumor; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; priority journal; resuscitation; small intestine tumor; thyroid medullary carcinoma; Betacoronavirus; cancer grading; Coronavirus infection; disease management; endocrinology; neuroendocrine tumor; pandemic; procedures; telemedicine; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Endocrinology; Humans; Neoplasm Grading; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine","32554825","Eur.

Methods: Retrospective, open-label, real-world, uncontrolled, single-arm case series conducted in 2 tertiary hospitals in NSW, Australia and 1 tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia. Five adult male patients aged between 46 and 74 years with type 1 respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and biochemical evidence of systemic hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg/L; ferritin greater than 700 μg/L) were administered variable-dose tocilizumab. Results: At between 13 and 26 days follow-up, all patients are alive and have been discharged from ICU. Two patients have been discharged home. Two patients avoided endotracheal intubation. Oxygen therapy has been ceased in three patients. Four adverse events potentially associated with tocilizumab therapy occurred in three patients: ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia associated with central venous catheterization, myositis and hepatitis. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, 4 received corticosteroids and 2 received both lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. The time from first tocilizumab administration to improvement in ventilation, defined as a 25% reduction in fraction of inspired oxygen required to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 92%, ranged from 7 hours to 4.6 days. Conclusions: Tocilizumab use was associated with favorable clinical outcome in our patients. We recommend tocilizumab be included in randomized controlled trials of treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and be considered for compassionate use in such patients pending the results of these trials. © 2020 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","acute respiratory distress syndrome; coronavirus; immunomodulation; interleukin-6; pneumonia; tocilizumab; viral",,,"Int.

Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure. However, some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease. Till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some which are being tested for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-nCoV specifically that be supported by high-level evidence. The main purpose of this paper is to review typical and ongoing treatments for coronavirus disease including home remedies, herbal medicine, chemical drugs, plasma therapy, and also vaccinies. In this regards, famous herbal medicines and common chemical drugs which are routinely to be prescribed for patients are introduced. Moreover, a section is assigned to the drug interactions and some outdated drugs which have been proved to be inefficient.

Modestly sized case series have described clinical factors associated with COVID-19, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression analyses have been described in some cell types. Patients with cancer may have worse outcomes to COVID-19. Methods We performed an integrated study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across and within organ systems, by normal versus tumor, across several existing databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Census of Immune Single Cell Expression Atlas, The Human Cell Landscape, and more). We correlated gene expression with clinical factors (including but not limited to age, gender, race, body mass index, and smoking history), HLA genotype, immune gene expression patterns, cell subsets, and single-cell sequencing as well as commensal microbiome. Results Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No clinical factors were consistently identified to be significantly associated with gene expression levels though outlier organ systems were observed for some factors. Similarly, no HLA genotypes were consistently associated with gene expression levels. Strong correlations were observed between ACE2 expression levels and multiple immune gene signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype as well as inverse associations with angiogenesis and transforming growth factor-β signatures. ACE2 positively correlated with macrophage subsets across tumor types. TMPRSS2 was less associated with immune gene expression but was strongly associated with epithelial cell abundance. Single-cell sequencing analysis across nine independent studies demonstrated little to no ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lymphocytes or macrophages. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression associated with commensal microbiota in matched normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers, with distinct bacterial populations showing strong associations. Conclusions We performed a large-scale integration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across clinical, genetic, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We suggest caution in interpretation regarding genetic associations with ACE2 expression suggested from smaller case series. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Recent studies show that innate immune populations may possess a form of memory, termed Trained Immunity (TRIM), where innate immune cells undergo metabolic, mitochondrial, and epigenetic reprogramming following exposure to an initial stimulus that results in a memory phenotype of enhanced immune responses when exposed to a secondary, heterologous, stimulus. Throughout the literature, it has been shown that the induction of TRIM using such inducers as the BCG vaccine and β-glucan can provide protection through altered immune responses against a range of viral infections. Here we hypothesize a potential role for β-glucan in decreasing worldwide morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, and posit several ideas as to how TRIM may actually shape the observed epidemiological phenomena related to COVID-19. We also evaluate the potential effects of β-glucan in relation to the immune dysregulation and cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the use of oral β-glucan in a prophylactic setting could be an effective way to boost immune responses and abrogate symptoms in COVID-19, though clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this treatment and to further examine differential effects of β-glucan's from various sources. © Copyright © 2020 Geller and Yan.","COVID-19; innate immunity; SARS-CoV-2; trained immunity; β-glucan","beta glucan; gamma interferon; interleukin 1beta; nitric oxide; transcription factor NFAT; tumor necrosis factor; age; antiviral activity; Article; BCG vaccination; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; Candida albicans; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell wall; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; dendritic cell; epigenetics; Escherichia coli; flu like syndrome; human; immune response; immunogenicity; immunological memory; innate immunity; Listeria monocytogenes; lung alveolus macrophage; natural killer cell; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; Pleurotus ostreatus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Spring viremia of carp virus; Staphylococcus aureus; Toxoplasma gondii; trained immunity; upregulation; virus load; Yersinia pestis","32760409","Front.

This poses a serious threat that needs to be addressed immediately. Genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed its close relation to SARS-coronavirus along with few changes in its spike protein. The spike protein aids in receptor binding and viral entry within the host and therefore represents a potential target for vaccine and therapeutic development. In the current study, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was explored for potential immunogenic epitopes to design multi-epitope vaccine constructs. The S1 and S2 domains of spike proteins were analyzed, and two vaccine constructs were prioritized with T-cell and B-cell epitopes. We adapted a comprehensive predictive framework to provide novel insights into immunogenic epitopes of spike proteins, which can further be evaluated as potential vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

Some are asymptomatic and some develop severe disease leading to mortality across ages. This contrast triggered us explore the causes, with the background that a vaccine for effective immunization or a drug to tackle COVID-19 is not too close to reality. We have discussed strategies to combat COVID-19 through immune enhancement, using simple measures including nutritional supplements. Discussion: A literature search on mortality-related comorbid conditions was performed. For those conditions, we analyzed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could cause the draining of the immune reservoir. We also analyzed the immune markers necessary for the defense mechanism/immune surveillance against COVID-19, especially through simple means including immune enhancing nutritional supplement consumption, and we suggest strategies to combat COVID-19. Major comorbid conditions associated with increased mortality include cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, being immunocompromised by cancer, and severe kidney disease with a senile immune system. Consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans strain (AFO-202) beta 1,3-1,6 glucan supported enhanced IL-8, sFAS macrophage activity, and NK cells' cytotoxicity, which are major defense mechanisms against viral infection. Conclusion: People with co-morbid conditions who are more prone to COVID-19-related deaths due to immune dysregulation are likely to benefit from consuming nutritional supplements that enhance the immune system. We recommend clinical studies to validate AFO-202 beta glucan in COVID-19 patients to prove its efficacy in overcoming a hyper-inflammation status, thus reducing the mortality, until a definite vaccine is made available. © Copyright © 2020 Rao, Suryaprakash, Senthilkumar, Preethy, Katoh, Ikewaki and Abraham.","AFO-202 beta glucan; chronic kidney disease; co-morbidity; COVID-19; diabetes; hypertension; immuno-compromised; nutritional supplement","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; beta 1,3 glucan; beta 1,6 glucan; C reactive protein; gamma interferon; interleukin 12; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nutrition supplement; pattern recognition receptor; protein kinase C; protein p70; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; cardiovascular disease; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; chronic kidney failure; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine storm; diabetes mellitus; host susceptibility; human; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunity; immunomodulation; immunosuppressive treatment; malignant neoplasm; mortality; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral clearance; virus entry","32733487","Front.

Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses.

The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don’t suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients’ health after the active phase of the infection is over. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Apoptosis; Bat; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Melatonin; SARS-CoV-2","antioxidant; melatonin; non prescription drug; age; aged; aging; animal; bat; Betacoronavirus; circadian rhythm; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; human; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; photoperiodicity; virology; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Animals; Antioxidants; Betacoronavirus; Chiroptera; Circadian Rhythm; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Melatonin; Nonprescription Drugs; Pandemics; Photoperiod; Pneumonia, Viral","32347747","Int.

Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study conducted in a pediatric intensive and high-dependency care unit (PICU, HDU) in an urban hospital in Paris. All patients, aged from 1 month to 18 years, admitted for confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 were included. Results: We analyzed the data of 27 children. Comorbidities (n = 19, 70%) were mainly neurological (n = 7), respiratory, (n = 4), or sickle cell disease (n = 4). SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were positive in 24 children (nasopharyngeal swabs). The three remaining children had a chest CT scan consistent with COVID-19. Respiratory involvement was observed in 24 patients (89%). Supportive treatments were invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 9), catecholamine (n = 4), erythropheresis (n = 4), renal replacement therapy (n = 1), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 1). Five children died, of whom three were without past medical history. Conclusion: This study highlighted the large spectrum of clinical presentation and time course of disease progression as well as the non-negligible occurrence of pediatric life-threatening and fatal cases of COVID-19 mostly in patients with comorbidities.

ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies. Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers, and RAAS inhibitors. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines. In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity. In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Although its etiologic agent is discovered as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are many unsolved issues in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The causes of different clinical phenotypes and incubation periods among individuals, species specificity, and cytokine storm with lymphopenia as well as the mechanism of damage to organ cells are unknown. It has been suggested that in viral pneumonia, virus itself is not a direct cause of acute lung injury; rather, aberrant immune reactions of the host to the insults from viral infection are responsible. According to its epidemiological and clinical characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 may be a virus with low virulence in nature that has adapted to the human species. Current immunological concepts have limited ability to explain such unsolved issues, and a presumed immu-nopathogenesis of COVID-19 is presented under the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis. Every disease, including COVID-19, has etiological substances controlled by the host immune system according to size and biochemical properties. Patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 show more severe hypercytokinemia with corresponding lympho-cytopenia than patients with mild pneumonia; thus, early immunomodulator treatment, including corticosteroids, has been considered. However, current guidelines recommend their use only for patients with advanced pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the immunopathogenesis of pneumonia may be the same for all patients regardless of age or severity and the critical immune-mediated lung injury may begin in the early stage of the disease, early immunomodulator treatment, including corticosteroids and intravenous immuno-globulin, can help reduce morbidity and possibly mortality rates of older patients with underlying conditions. © 2020 by The Korean Pediatric Society.","Corticosteroids; COVID-19; Intravenous immuno-globulin; Pathogenesis; Protein-homeosta-sis-system hypothesis","corticosteroid; high mobility group B1 protein; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; methylprednisolone; polypeptide antibiotic agent; protein S 100; RNA directed RNA polymerase; 2009 H1N1 influenza; adult respiratory distress syndrome; asymptomatic infection; bacterial flora; clinical feature; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug megadose; dysbiosis; hemorrhagic fever; herd immunity; Hong Kong influenza; human; immune response; immunopathogenesis; immunotherapy; incubation time; innate immunity; lung injury; lymphocytopenia; mortality rate; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; orchitis; pancreatitis; pyelonephritis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; rhabdomyolysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; taxonomy; virus load; virus pneumonia; virus replication; virus virulence",,"Korean J.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and is believed to originate from bat, quickly spread into a global pandemic. This RNA virus has a special affinity for porphyrins. It invades the cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and binds to hemoproteins, resulting in a severe systemic inflammatory response, particularly in high ACE-2 organs like the lungs, heart, and kidney, resulting in systemic disease. The inflammatory response manifested by increased cytokine levels and reactive oxygen species results in inhibition of heme oxygenase (HO-1), with a subsequent loss of cytoprotection. This has been seen in other viral illness like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and SARS/MERS. There are a number of medications that have been tried with some showing early clinical promise. This illness disproportionately affects patients with obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease with a baseline excess of cytokines. The majority of the medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP2D6. This is further complicated by genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, HO-1, ACE, and ACE-2. There is a potential role for HO-1 upregulation to treat/prevent cytokine storm.

Methods: 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. We used two comprehensive 11-colour flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice and approved for clinical diagnostics. Findings: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and γδ T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. Interpretation: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Understanding T cell-responses in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.

Objectives: The study aimed to address all these issues. Methods: In a case-controlled survey, we interviewed 1,486 PD patients attending a single tertiary center in Lombardy, Italy and 1,207 family members (controls). Results: One hundred five (7.1%) and 92 controls (7.6%) were identified as COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 patients were younger, more likely to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to be obese, and vitamin D nonsupplemented than unaffected patients. Six patients (5.7%) and 7 family members (7.6%) died from COVID-19. Patients were less likely to report shortness of breath and require hospitalization. Conclusions: In an unselected large cohort of nonadvanced PD patients, COVID-19 risk and mortality did not differ from the general population, but symptoms appeared to be milder.

It is a very complex systemic disease in terms of pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. Pharmacological treatment may include antiviral and antimalarial drugs, antibi-otics, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids as well as low-molecular-weight heparins to prevent the evo-lution of the disease from reaching the severe inflammatory phase that can lead to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and finally death. Therefore, pending the development of the much sought-after vaccine, there needs to be a multidisciplinary approach to tack-ling this disease, and it is essential to use different medical treatments at the correct pathogenic moment. The aim of this article is to evaluate the rationale and reason behind the use of antirheumatic drugs, by expert point of view, in the various phases of the disease. Another important aspect in the management of the disease is to identify patients at high risk, both to change their lifestyle and to correct the state of their health through non-pharmacological measures for improving their immuno-balance. Our literature review reveals the important role and the therapeutic potential of antirheumatic agents in preventing the progres-sion of the disease and aiding recovery from the disease. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of these agents, indicating that further randomized controlled studies are required. © 2020 Marco Valentini and Hassan Zmerly.","Antirheumatic drugs; COVID-19; Phases; Treatment","antimalarial agent; antirheumatic agent; monoclonal antibody; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antimalarials; Antirheumatic Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32650355","J.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel-group, triple-blind, phase 2-3 randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients over the age of 15 from 5 types of cancer are included in the study. Patients with acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias in the first line treated with curative intent, patients with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with leukemia protocols and patients with non-metastatic breast and colon cancer in the first line of treatment will enter the study. The exclusion criteria will include known sensitivity to Hydroxychloroquine, weight below 35 kilograms, history of retinopathy, history of any cardiac disease, acute respiratory tract infection in the last 2 months, having COVID-19 in the first two weeks of entering the trial, having Diabetes Mellitus, having an immuno-suppressive disease other than cancer, having chronic pulmonary disease and taking immuno-suppressant drug other than chemotherapeutic agents for current cancer. This study is performed in five academic centres affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients are randomly assigned to two groups; one being given hydroxychloroquine and the other is given placebo. During two months of treatment, the two groups are treated with either hydroxychloroquine (Amin® Pharmaceutical Company, Isfahan, Iran) or placebo (identical in terms of shape, colour, smell) as a single 200 mg tablet every other day. Patients will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms during the follow-up period. If signs or symptoms occur (fever, cough, shortness of breath), they will be examined and investigated with a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, COVID-19 specific IgM, IgG antibody assay and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point of this study is to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in patients being treated for their cancer over a 2-month period. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be performed using randomly permuted blocks. By using an online website (www.randomization.com) the randomization sequence will be produced by quadruple blocks. The allocation ratio in intervention and control groups is 1:1. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants and caregivers do not know whether the patient is in the intervention or the control group. The outcome assessor and the data analyst are also blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The calculated total sample size is 60 patients, with 30 patients in each group. TRIAL STATUS: The trial began on April 14, 2020 and recruitment is ongoing. Recruitment is anticipated to be completed by June 14, 2020 There has been no change in study protocol since approval, protocol version 1 was approved April 12, 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered by the title of ""Effect of Hydroxychloroquine on Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) prevention in cancer patients under treatment"" in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) with code ""IRCT20200405046958N1"", https://www.irct.ir/trial/46946.

Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of ""nanoimmunity by design""can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when preparing for future pandemics. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Computational chemistry; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Disease control; Disinfection; Nanotechnology; Physicochemical properties; Viruses; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Chemical functionalization; Computational science; Engineered materials; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Nanoparticle (NPs); Therapeutic potentials; Vaccine development; Diseases; COVID-19 vaccine; cytokine; virus vaccine; Betacoronavirus; biomimetics; biosynthesis; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disinfection; drug delivery system; environmental microbiology; genetics; human; immunology; immunomodulation; mask; nanomedicine; nanotechnology; pandemic; photochemotherapy; procedures; protective equipment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomimetics; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disinfection; Drug Delivery Systems; Environmental Microbiology; Humans; Immunomodulation; Masks; Nanomedicine; Nanotechnology; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Photochemotherapy; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines","32519842","ACS Nano",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086863034

Despite their vital role in viral infection, the contribution of NK cells in fighting SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been directly investigated. Insights into pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities can therefore be inferred from studies assessing NK cell phenotype and function during SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. These studies suggest a reduction in circulating NK cell numbers and/or an exhausted phenotype following infection and hint toward the dampening of NK cell responses by coronaviruses. Reduced circulating NK cell levels and exhaustion may be directly responsible for the progression and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, in light of data linking inflammation with coronavirus disease severity, it is necessary to examine NK cell potential in mediating immunopathology. A common feature of coronavirus infections is that significant morbidity and mortality is associated with lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from an exaggerated immune response, of which NK cells are an important component. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how NK cells respond in both early and late coronavirus infections, and the implication for ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials. Using this immunological lens, we outline recommendations for therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in clearing the virus while preventing the harm of immunopathological responses. © Copyright © 2020 Market, Angka, Martel, Bastin, Olanubi, Tennakoon, Boucher, Ng, Ardolino and Auer.","COVID-19; immunotherapy; innate immunity; interferon; NK cells","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; BCG vaccine; beta interferon; ciclesonide; emapalumab; gamma interferon; granzyme B; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; natural killer cell receptor NKG2A; pathogen associated molecular pattern; pattern recognition receptor; peginterferon lambda; pembrolizumab; recombinant alpha2b interferon; remdesivir; ribavirin; ritonavir; sarilumab; thymosin alpha1; tocilizumab; vitamin D; corticosteroid; cytokine; interferon; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; CD4+ T lymphocyte; chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cell immunotherapy; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine response; disease severity; hospital acquired pneumonia; host susceptibility; human; immunological memory; immunomodulation; immunopathology; immunotherapy; innate immunity; natural killer cell; nonhuman; Review; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral clearance; virus entry; adoptive transfer; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; mortality; mouse; natural killer cell; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adoptive Transfer; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Ascorbic Acid; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunologic Memory; Interferon Type I; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32655581","Front.

However, despite its high pathogenicity and transmissibility, the severity of the associated disease, COVID-19, varies widely. While the prognosis is favorable in most patients, critical illness, manifested by respiratory distress, thromboembolism, shock, and multi-organ failure, has been reported in about 5% of cases. Several studies have associated poor COVID-19 outcomes with the exhaustion of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of D-dimer. In this article, we propose a common pathophysiological denominator for these negative prognostic markers, endogenous, angiotensin II toxicity. We hypothesize that, like in avian influenza, the outlook of COVID-19 is negatively correlated with the intracellular accumulation of angiotensin II promoted by the viral blockade of its degrading enzyme receptors. In this model, upregulated angiotensin II causes premature vascular senescence, leading to dysfunctional coagulation, and immunity. We further hypothesize that angiotensin II blockers and immune checkpoint inhibitors may be salutary for COVID-19 patients with critical illness by reversing both the clotting and immune defects (Graphical Abstract). © Copyright © 2020 Sfera, Osorio, Jafri, Diaz and Campo Maldonado.","angiotensin II; cellular senescence; critical illness; immune checkpoint inhibitors; prognosis; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; angiotensin receptor antagonist; BCG vaccine; cariprazine; D dimer; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 antibody; nitric oxide; poliomyelitis vaccine; reactive oxygen metabolite; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; angiotensin receptor antagonist; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dopamine; Article; blood clotting disorder; cell aging; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cytokine storm; disorders of mitochondrial functions; down regulation; endothelial dysfunction; gene overexpression; human; immunity; intoxication; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; pandemic; pathophysiology; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; upregulation; virus replication; age; Betacoronavirus; blood; brain; Coronavirus infection; critical illness; drug effect; immunology; immunotherapy; metabolism; mitochondrion; pathophysiology; procedures; prognosis; upregulation; virology; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Angiotensin II; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Cellular Senescence; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Cytokines; Dopamine; Down-Regulation; Humans; Immunotherapy; Mitochondria; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Renin-Angiotensin System; Up-Regulation","32655579","Front.

COVID-19 exhibits a strong human-to-human transmission infectivity and could cause acute respiratory diseases. Asymptomatic carriers are able to infect other healthy persons, and this poses a challenge for public health; the World Health Organization (WHO) has already announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Nucleic acid testing, considered as the current primary method for diagnosing COVID-19, might lead to false negatives and is difficult to be applied for every suspected patient because of the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Meanwhile, detecting specific antibodies in blood, such as the IgM antibody, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is another choice for COVID-19 diagnosis, as it is widely accepted that IgM is an important indicator in the acute infection period. In this study, a colloidal gold nanoparticle-based lateral-flow (AuNP-LF) assay was developed to achieve rapid diagnosis and on-site detection of the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the indirect immunochromatography method. For preparing AuNP-LF strips, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 NP) was coated on an analytical membrane for sample capture, and antihuman IgM was conjugated with AuNPs to form the detecting reporter. Optimization of AuNP-LF assay was carried out by altering the pH value and the amount of antihuman IgM. The performance of AuNP-LF assay was evaluated by testing serum samples of COVID-19 patients and normal humans. The results were compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of AuNP-LF assay were determined to be 100 and 93.3%, respectively, and an almost perfect agreement was exhibited by Kappa statistics (κ coefficient = 0.872). AuNP-LF assay showed outstanding selectivity in the detection of IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 virus with no interference from other viruses such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and dengue virus (DFV). AuNP-LF assay was able to achieve results within 15 min and needed only 10-20 μL serum for each test. As a whole, in the light of its advantages such as excellent specificity and stability, easy operation, low cost, and being less time-consuming, AuNP-LF assay is a feasible method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary hospitals and laboratories, especially in emergency situations in which numerous samples need to be tested on time. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,"ACS Omega",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085772370

Currently, no licensed vaccines are available for COVID-19. The identification of immunodominant epitopes for both B-and T-cells that induce protective responses in the host is crucial for effective vaccine design. Computational prediction of potential epitopes might significantly reduce the time required to screen peptide libraries as part of emergent vaccine design. In our present study, we used an extensive immunoinformatics-based approach to predict conserved immunodominant epitopes from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Regions from SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were defined as immunodominant, based on the following three criteria regarding B-and T-cell epitopes: (i) they were both mapped, (ii) they predicted protective antigens, and (iii) they were completely identical to experimentally validated epitopes of SARS-CoV. Further, structural and molecular docking analyses were performed in order to understand the binding interactions of the identified immunodominant epitopes with human major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Our study provides a set of potential immunodominant epitopes that could enable the generation of both antibody-and cell-mediated immunity. This could contribute to developing peptide vaccine-based adaptive immunotherapy against SARS-CoV-2 infections and prevent future pandemic outbreaks. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis. Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Additional experiments and clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation. © 2020","COVID-19; Cytokines; Immunomodulation; Melatonin; Oxidation-reduction; SARS-CoV-2","melatonin; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; cytokine; immunological adjuvant; melatonin; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine production; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; epidemic; human; immune response; immunomodulation; immunoregulation; inflammation; oxidative stress; pandemic; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus attenuation; virus pathogenesis; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; inflammation; virology; virus pneumonia; Acute Lung Injury; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Immunomodulation; Inflammation; Melatonin; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult","32217117","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082653958

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228 ± 0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28 ± 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July–11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041; a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%; and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak. The study provides important information for public health providers and the government to control the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality. Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes. This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19. Recent Findings: Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes. Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality. Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population. Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19. Summary: Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes. Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis. Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome. A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cancer; Cardio-oncology; Cardiovascular disease; COVID-19","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anthracycline; chemokine receptor CCR5; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; heparin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; leronlimab; sarilumab; simvastatin; sunitinib; thromboplastin; tocilizumab; vasculotropin inhibitor; anticoagulation; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; dengue; disease severity; disease transmission; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; high risk population; human; hypertension; immune related adverse event; immunopathology; infection risk; ischemia; Italy; kidney carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; pneumonia; prevalence; prognosis; renal cell carcinoma; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; telemedicine; thrombosis; United States; Betacoronavirus; cardiology; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; oncology; physiology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cardiology; Cardiotoxicity; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors","32462289","Curr.

Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: “mild”,symbolized as a “drizzle” of cytokines, severe as a “storm”, and critical as a “hurricane”. In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage. In severe phenotype, resembling a “cytokine-release syndrome”, SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure. In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression. © 2020 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","COVID-19; CRS; cytokines; HLH/MAS; SARS-CoV2","C reactive protein; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; cyclophosphamide; gamma interferon; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; inflammasome; interleukin 1; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lactate dehydrogenase; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; acute lung injury; adaptive immunity; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease exacerbation; disease severity; hemophagocytic syndrome; human; immune response; immune system; immunoreactivity; intensive care unit; lung alveolus epithelium; lung epithelium; lymphocyte count; phenotype; respiratory distress; respiratory distress syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; immunology; lymphocytopenia; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Acute Lung Injury; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Humans; Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic; Lymphopenia; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult","32460624","Exp.

Most recently, studies on confirmed COVID-19 cases have suggested that mortality might be due to virally induced hyperinflammation. Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating α-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia.

Metformin is capable of suppressing one of the molecular triggers of the proinflammatory and prothrombotic processes of urban PM air pollution, namely the mitochondrial ROS/Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC)/IL-6 cascade. Given the linkage between mitochondrial functionality, ion channels, and inflamm-aging, the ability of metformin to target mitochondrial electron transport and prevent ROS/CRAC-mediated IL-6 release might illuminate new therapeutic avenues to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in older people. The incorporation of infection rates, severity and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infections as new outcomes of metformin usage in elderly populations at risk of developing severe COVID-19, together with the assessment of bronchial/serological titers of inflammatory cytokines and D-dimers, could provide a novel mechanistic basis for the consideration of metformin as a therapeutic strategy against the inflammatory and thrombotic states underlying the gerolavic traits of SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020, Menendez.","Aging; Air pollution; COVID-19; Inflammation; Particulate matter","antidiabetic agent; calcium release activated calcium channel; interleukin 6; metformin; reactive oxygen metabolite; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; human; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; pandemic; particulate matter; physiology; procedures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; thrombosis; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Calcium Release Activated Calcium Channels; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Inflammation; Interleukin-6; Metformin; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Thrombosis","32463794","Aging",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086096349

Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) analogs, AAL-R and RP-002, have earlier provided in-vivo protection from the pathophysiological response during H1N1 influenza infection and improved mortality. Recently, it was shown that the treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 analog, CYM5442, resulted in the significant dampening of the immune response upon H1N1 challenge in mice and improved survival of H1N1 infected mice in combination with an antiviral drug, oseltamivir.

In this cohort, significantly lower 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.004) were found in PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with negative patients (24.6 ng/mL); this was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age >70 years.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use. © 2020 by the authors.

As a result, there has been considerable economic distress globally and a significant loss of life. Sadly, the vulnerable and immunocompromised in our societies seem to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 complications. Global public health bodies and governments have ignited strategies and issued advisories on various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, social distancing strategies, and, in the most extreme cases, some countries have adopted “stay in place” or lockdown protocols to prevent COVID-19 spread. Notably, there are several significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. These include the presence of poor nutritional status and pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, and various other diseases that render the patient immunocompromised. These diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, which may be a common feature of these NCDs, affecting patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are currently under investigation intended to dampen the cytokine storm of severe COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, nutritional status and the role of diet and lifestyle is considered, as it is known to affect patient outcomes in other severe infections and may play a role in COVID-19 infection. This review speculates the importance of nutrition as a mitigation strategy to support immune function amid the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying food groups and key nutrients of importance that may affect the outcomes of respiratory infections. © 2020 by the authors.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS","alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; ascorbic acid; chloroquine; cinanserin; cyclosporine; diarylheptanoid derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; emodin; flavonoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monoclonal antibody; nelfinavir; nicotianamine; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; promazine; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; selenium; thymopentin; thymosin alpha1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin B group; zinc; COVID-19; immunologic factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trace element; virus vaccine; vitamin; antiviral therapy; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; human; infection control; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; nutritional status; passive immunization; pathogenicity; plasma; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunologic Factors; Nutritional Status; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Trace Elements; Viral Vaccines; Vitamins","32052466","J.

We propose that optimal standards of care be upheld, and short-term safety concerns due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 be weighed against a long-term compromise in cancer prognosis when deciding on adjustments in cancer care.

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in 11 patients with established diagnosis of COVID-19 and 10 patients with diseases other than COVID- 19 in our hospital. We collected samples of serum, plasma and whole blood from each patient between February, 12 and 18, 2020, and with a double- blind design, the samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min. In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay. We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples. RESULTS: With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively. For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%. Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9998-1.000, P < 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 ℃ for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators. Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.","antibodies; heat inactivation; plasma; SARS-CoV-2; serum","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; heat; human; pandemic; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Hot Temperature; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies","32376571","Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084389085

During this current public health emergency of international concern, screening and diagnosing patients quickly in order to aid containment is a priority. Most of our knowledge on diagnostics comes from previous studies on SARSCoV. Since SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same large family of viruses as those that cause the MERS and SARS outbreak, we could assume that its antibody generation process should be similar. The high contagiousness and the characteristics of high lethality of the epidemic require efficient diagnostics, able to quickly identify the sources of the infection. The identification of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the amplification of a viral genome sequence using molecular biology techniques (real-time polymerase chain reaction), which can be subsequently confirmed by gene sequencing. However, the variability linked to the execution of the swab and the limitations of the test (complexity, biosecurity levels, costs and long response times) makes molecular diagnostics unsuitable for use in the field. Consequently, new tools such as serological tests capable of tracking the virus through each phase of the disease are in great demand. Serological antibody tests are already being developed and have already been introduced to the market. To date, however, there is no robust scientific evidence on the clinical-diagnostic reliability of these tests which therefore, at the moment, cannot replace the molecular test. The few studies in the literature are of limited thickness, sometimes discordant with each other and conducted on a small scale mainly on the Chinese population. In the absence of specific references, there is an open debate on the best use of these serological tests and on the ideal moment of their execution. In this review we describe the main characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the diagnostic molecular strategies available today, and the first experimental data on the determination of antibodies directed towards SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA Online version at http://www.minervamedica.it","Coronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnostic testing; SARS virus","Article; Chinese; coronavirus disease 2019; gene sequence; human; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"Riv.

World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 as the pandemic disease. Pro-fessionally, Dentists are prone to get the cross-infection. And are at 100% risk. This is because Dentists come across face to face communication with the patients, frequent exposure to saliva, blood, other body fluids while handling the teeth and sharp instruments. So, precautionary and preventive measures should be taken to prevent and minimize the cross-infection and spread of COVID-19. The susceptible people of COVID-19 are those who had a travel history from abroad, elderly people, immuno-compromised, and people with co-morbidities. This condition is more prevalent in males when compared to females. Transmission can be broadly divided into the direct and indi-rect transmission. In general, a COVID infected patient shows signs of symp-toms like fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, body pain, lethargy, and breathlessness. At present, no cure or vaccine has been discovered. Cur-rently, a combination of anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs is being used to treat patients. Simultaneously, multi-vitamins and Hydroxychloroquine is administered to most susceptible patients after consulting the physician. Prevention for aerosol, body fluids, nasal discharge is a must. Disinfection of sur-rounding and personal protective wear, which includes a face shield, mask, gown, head cap, double gloving, and glasses, should be worn by healthcare professionals to limit the contact to the virus.

Previous studies have found few patients with asthma among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia cases. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe asthma exacerbation is not known. Objective: To assess the frequency of asthma exacerbation in patients with asthma hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compare symptoms and laboratory and radiological findings in patients with and without asthma with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods: We included 106 patients between March 4 and April 6, 2020, who were hospitalized in the Chest Diseases Department of Strasbourg University Hospital; 23 had asthma. To assess the patients' asthma status, 3 periods were defined: the last month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (p1), prehospitalization (p2), and during hospitalization (p3). Severe asthma exacerbations were defined according to Global INitiative for Asthma guidelines during p1 and p2. During p3, we defined severe asthma deterioration as the onset of breathlessness and wheezing requiring systemic corticosteroids and inhaled β2 agonist. Results: We found no significant difference between patients with and without asthma in terms of severity (length of stay, maximal oxygen flow needed, noninvasive ventilation requirement, and intensive care unit transfer); 52.2% of the patients with asthma had Global INitiative for Asthma step 1 asthma. One patient had a severe exacerbation during p1, 2 patients during p2, and 5 patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled β2 agonist during p3. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that patients with asthma appeared not to be at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lung infection, gastrointestinal symptoms described in COVID-19 patients and detection of the viral RNA in feces of infected patients drove attentions to a possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. However, not only the viral RNA but also the infectious viral particles are required for the viral infection and no proof has been demonstrated the transmission of the infectious virus particles via the fecal-oral route yet. Growing evidence indicates the crosstalk between gut microbiota and lung, that maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system. This gut-lung interaction may influence the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Severity of COVID-19 has mostly associated with old ages and underlying medical conditions. Since the diversity in the gut microbiota decreases during aging, dysbiosis could be the reason for older adults being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. We believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of COVID-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota results in gut permeability leading to secondary infection and multiple organ failure. Conversely, disruption of the gut barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may lead to translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from the lung into the intestinal lumen via circulatory and lymphatic system. This review points out the role of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota involving in sepsis, on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, this review aims to clarify the ambiguity in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. © TÜBİTAK.","COVID-19; Dysbiosis; Gut permeability; Gut-lung axis",,,"Turk. J.

This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a pandemic. To date, it has resulted in ~9 million confirmed cases and caused almost 500 000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID-19 pandemic is the gravest health and socioeconomic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence-based medical advice on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self-limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID-19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a “cytokine storm” leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thromboembolic complications, and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID-19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID-19–related topics should be based on more coordinated high-quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development, and epidemiology.

By combining these three approaches, the seroprevalence of anti–SARSCoV- 2 antibodies can be examined in healthcare teams. The aim of the study was to examine the seroprevalence of anti–SARSCoV- 2 antibodies in a population of healthcare professionals 6–8 weeks after the first COVID-19 case was detected in the Czech Republic. A total of 269 subjects were enrolled in the study (187 women, 82 men) with a median age of 45.9 years (21 – 71 years). We used a questionnaire to ascertain travel history and clinical signs of any respiratory tract infection. Blood samples were collected, and IgG levels were analysed in all samples. The level of IgA antibodies was analysed in those positive for IgG. PCR testing was performed in cases testing positive for presence of antibodies. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 from Euroimmun (Germany) was used to analyse immunoglobulin levels. 17% of the tested cohort reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 35.8% reported history of international travel. There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85%), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37%). There was only one PCR positive subject. Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals.

Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor so far with an EC50 of 17 nmol/L and an SI value of 10,505.88 in infected cells. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knock-out cells.

The coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) enzyme is essential for proteolytic maturation of the virus. This study was based on immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The design of the multiepitope vaccine was built using helper T-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes from the 3CL hydrolase protein along with an adjuvant to enhance immune response; these are joined to each other by short peptide linkers. The vaccine also carries potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes, and interferon-γ-inducing epitopes. Epitopes of the constructed multiepitope vaccine were found to be antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxic, and covering large human populations worldwide. The vaccine construct was modeled, validated, and refined by different programs to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure. The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B-cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response.

Pneumonia cases were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Inoculation of respiratory samples into human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines, led to the isolation of a novel respiratory virus whose genome analysis showed it to be a novel coronavirus related to SARS-CoV, and therefore named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 12 March 2020. To date, the world has paid a high toll in this pandemic in terms of human lives lost, economic repercussions and increased poverty. In this review, we provide information regarding the epidemiology, serological and molecular diagnosis, origin of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to infect human cells, and safety issues. Then we focus on the available therapies to fight COVID-19, the development of vaccines, the role of artificial intelligence in the management of the pandemic and limiting the spread of the virus, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on our lifestyle, and preparation for a possible second wave. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ACE2; COVID-19; cytokine storm; pneumonia; rRT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; serology","adenovirus vector; alpha interferon; chloroquine; D dimer; darunavir; glucocorticoid; human monoclonal antibody; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M; inactivated vaccine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; neutralizing antibody; nucleic acid vaccine; pittcovacc; remdesivir; ribavirin; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; vitronectin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antigen detection; apoptosis; artificial intelligence; artificial ventilation; asymptomatic disease; blood analysis; blood sampling; cardiovascular disease; chemoluminescence; Chinese medicine; clinical feature; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; CRISPR Cas system; crispr cas12 based assay; critical illness; disease severity; disinfection; drug research; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemiological data; health care system; hemophagocytic syndrome; human; immunoassay; immunochromatographic test; incubation time; infection prevention; lifestyle modification; managed care; molecular diagnosis; multicenter study (topic); pandemic; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory virus; Review; safety procedure; serology; specimen handling; T lymphocyte; throat culture; treatment indication; vaccination; viral load testing; virus load; virus transmission; Western blotting","32239133","Crit.

We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0–1 Å. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected.

In addition, active clinical trials, as well as challenging issues related to the future of remdesivir in Covid-19, are covered. Up to the date of writing this review (19 May 2020), there is one finished randomized clinical trial and two completed non-randomized studies, in addition to some ongoing studies, including three observational studies, two expanded access studies, and seven active clinical trials registered on the clinicaltrials.gov and isrctn.com websites.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. The viral genome was sequenced and a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was developed and used for the detection of virus. Different countries took different approaches for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Some countries prioritized extensive testing for COVID-19 at a very early phase of the pandemic whereas other countries took a long time to build the testing capacity and to implement the testing extensively. The assay design formats were available in the public domain and thereby allowing researchers to replicate them to make diagnostic kits. Consequently, several antigen or antibody-based diagnostic tests were also developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, there were some validation and regulatory challenges while bringing these assays into the market. During the course of the pandemic, it became clear that the countries which implemented testing at an early stage of the pandemic were capable of controlling the spread more effectively than those that implemented them at later stages. As several countries implemented a lockdown for controlling the spread of the virus, it is critical to build the testing capability to meet the extensive need of testing while exiting the lockdown. Testing and isolation of positive cases are the most effective ways of preventing the spread of virus and gradually returning life back to normality. © 2020, Indian Virological Society.","Antibody; Antigen; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Laboratory testing; RT-qPCR; SARS CoV-2; Serological test",,,"VirusDisease",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089157252

The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new name coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for this disease, whereas the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy renamed 2019-nCov as SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). The development of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only of great social importance, but also draws the attention of a medical community to the fundamentally new clinical and fundamental problems of the immunopathology of human diseases that are yet to be formulated. The unique experience gained in rheumatology from studies of the pathogenetic mechanisms and pharmacotherapy of immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IMIRDs) can be of great importance for deciphering the nature of the pathological processes that underlie the severe, potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, and may assist in improving their therapy. As for prospects in patients with IMIRDs, although the development of COVID-19 in the presence of IMIRDs has not yet fortunately been described, infection with SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, can be assumed to cause an exacerbation of the pathological process, whereas severe immune system pathology and comorbidities can worsen the course of infection. Since, according to the current concepts, it is the «hyperimmune» response, and not just the effect only of the virus itself, that underlies lung damage and deaths from COVID-19, special attention is drawn to the effects of antirheumatic therapy that includes glucocorticoids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biological agents, and targeted DMARDs, which can have a multidirectional effect on the course of COVID-19. There are significant theoretical prerequisites for the repurposing of some drugs widely used in rheumatology for the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Consideration is given to the prospects of studying the immunopathology of COVID-19 and to the theoretical justifications for the use of antimalarial 4-aminoquinolines, anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and Janus kinase inhibitors for the prevention of complications and for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020 Ima-Press Publishing House.

A substantial minority of patients hospitalized develop an acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome, which can manifest with a variety of clinical presentations but often presents as an acute cardiac injury with cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The cause of this injury is uncertain but is suspected to be related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, systemic cytokine-mediated injury, or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Although histologically unproven, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has the potential to directly replicate within cardiomyocytes and pericytes, leading to viral myocarditis. Systemically elevated cytokines are also known to be cardiotoxic and have the potential to result in profound myocardial injury. Prior experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 has helped expedite the evaluation of several promising therapies, including antiviral agents, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and convalescent serum. Management of acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists, and cardiologists. Priorities for managing acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point at which intervention may be most effective. This article aims to review the best available data on acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. From these data, we propose a surveillance, diagnostic, and management strategy that balances potential patient risks and healthcare staff exposure with improvement in meaningful clinical outcomes. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Since no specific therapy is currently available for the same, the present study was aimed to explore the SARS-CoV-2 genome for the identification of immunogenic regions using immunoinformatics approach. A series of computational tools were applied in a systematic way to identify the epitopes that could be utilized in vaccine development. The screened-out epitopes were passed through several immune filters, such as promiscuousity, conservancy, antigenicity, nonallergenicity, population coverage, nonhomologous to human proteins, and affinity with human leukocyte antigen alleles, to screen out the best possible ones. Further, a construct comprising 11 CD4, 12 CD8, 3 B cell, and 3 interferon-γ epitopes, along with an adjuvant β-defensin, was designed in silico, resulting in the formation of a multiepitope vaccine. The in silico immune simulation and population coverage analysis of the vaccine sequence showed its capacity to elicit cellular, humoral, and innate immune cells and to cover up a worldwide population of more than 97%. Further, the interaction analysis of the vaccine construct with Toll-like receptor 3 (immune receptor) was carried out by docking and dynamics simulations, revealing high affinity, constancy, and pliability between the two. The overall findings suggest that the vaccine may be highly effective, and is therefore required to be tested in the lab settings to evaluate its efficacy. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","dynamics simulations; immunoinformatics; molecular docking; promiscuous; SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

We discuss mitochondrial contribution to Covid-19 sepsis, specifically the complex interaction of innate immune function, viral replication, hyper-inflammatory state, and HIF-α/Sirtuin pathways. Methods: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using the combination of terms “SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, sepsis, mitochondria, aging, and immunometabolism”. Results: Evidence indicates that mitochondria in senescent cells may be dysfunctional and unable to keep up with hypermetabolic demands associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Mitochondrial proteins may serve as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) activating innate immunity. Disruption in normal oxidative phosphorylation pathways contributes to elevated ROS which activates sepsis cascade through HIF-α/Sirtuin pathway. Viral–mitochondrial interaction may be necessary for replication and increased viral load. Hypoxia and hyper-inflammatory state contribute to increased mortality associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Conclusions: Aging is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. Modulating Sirtuin activity is emerging as therapeutic agent in sepsis. HIF-α, levels of mitochondrial DNA, and other mitochondrial DAMP molecules may also serve as useful biomarker and need to be investigated. These mechanisms should be explored specifically for Covid-19-related sepsis.

Little is known about the protective factors of this infection. Therefore, preventive health measures that can reduce the risk of infection, progression and severity are desperately needed. This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity. Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p = 0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels (75–125 nmol/L). In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Therefore, randomized control trials and cohort studies are necessary to test this hypothesis. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Infections; SARS-CoV-2; Vitamin D; Vitamin D supplementation",,,"J.

Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect humans and they are OC43 CoV, NL63 CoV, HKU1 CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS CoV, and SARS CoV-2. Virus replication weakens the immune system of host thereby altering T-cell count and much of interferon response. Although no vaccine or therapeutic treatment has been approved till now for CoV infection, trials of vaccine against SARS CoV-2 are in progress. One of the epitopes used for vaccine production is of the spike protein on the surface of virus. The work focuses on designing of multi-epitope vaccine construct for treatment of seven human CoV infections using the epitopes present on the spike protein of human CoVs. To address this, immuno-informatics techniques have been employed to design multi-epitope vaccine construct. B- and T-cell epitopes of the spike proteins have been predicted and designed into a multi-epitope vaccine construct. The tertiary structure of the vaccine construct along with the adjuvant has been modelled and the physiochemical properties have been predicted. The multi-epitope vaccine construct has antigenic and non-allergenic property. After validation, refinement and disulphide engineering of the vaccine construct, molecular docking with toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been performed. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous environment predicted that the vaccine-TLRs complexes were stable. The vaccine construct is predicted to be able to trigger primary immune response in silico.

In the emergency setting new or available therapies to contrast the spread of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Elderly males, especially those affected by previous diseases or with comorbidities, are more prone to develop interstitial pneumonia that can deteriorate evolving to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) that require hospitalization in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Even children and young patients are not spared by SARS-CoV 2 infection, yet they seem to develop a milder form of disease. In this setting the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D, should be further investigated. Methods: We reviewed the literature about the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D collecting data from the databases Medline and Embase. Results: Vitamin D proved to interact both with the innate immune system, by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing the levels of cathelicidins and β-defensins, and adaptive immune system, by reducing immunoglobulin secretion by plasma cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, thus modulating T cells function. Promising results have been extensively described as regards the supplementation of vitamin D in respiratory tract infections, autoimmune diseases and even pulmonary fibrosis.

The consequent inflammation is not able to clear viruses. The persistent excessive inflammatory response can build up a clinical picture that is very difficult to manage and potentially fatal. Modulating the immune response plays a key role in fighting the disease. One of the main defence systems is the activation of neutrophils that release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) under the stimulus of autophagy. Various molecules can induce NETosis and autophagy; some potent activators are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and, in particular, the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). This molecule is released by damaged lung cells and can induce a robust innate immunity response. The increase in HMGB1 and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, blocking these molecules might be useful in COVID-19 treatment and should be further studied in the context of targeted therapy. © 2020 Sebastiano Cicco et al.",,"anakinra; biological factor; chloroquine; cytokine receptor antagonist; damage associated molecular pattern; eculizumab; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; remdesivir; steroid; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; alarmin; high mobility group B1 protein; HMGB1 protein, human; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; extracellular trap; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; immunity; inflammation; lung disease; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; plasma; respiratory virus; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; steroid therapy; systematic review (topic); viral respiratory tract infection; virus; virus infection; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; extracellular trap; immunology; lung; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Alarmins; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Extracellular Traps; HMGB1 Protein; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32724296","Mediators Inflamm.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088851846

Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis of 409 severe, hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 20 January to 29 February 2020 was performed. The longitudinal characteristics of immune inflammatory cytokines in patients with/without diarrhea were analyzed. The relations of diarrhea and immuno-inflammatory factors with illness course and clinical outcomes were further explored. Results: Diarrhea was more common and more serious with longer duration (4.9 ± 1.5 vs 4.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.039) and higher frequency (5.5 ± 2.1 vs 4.0 ± 2.0 times/day, P = 0.001) in deceased patients than in the survivors. Also, diarrhea patients were more inclined to develop multi-organ damage: survivors have longer illness course (media 41.0 vs 36.0 days, P = 0.052) and hospital stays (media 27.0 vs 23.0 days, P = 0.041), and the deceased patients had higher mortality (33.0% vs 22.6%, P = 0.045) and earlier death (media 20.0 vs 25.0 days, P = 0.038). Progressively, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, especially the declined CD8+ T cells, were demonstrated in diarrhea patients relative to the non-diarrhea cases. The inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α were intensively increased in patients with diarrhea. The multivariable logistic analysis showed longer duration of diarrhea (P = 0.036), higher neutrophil counts (P = 0.011), and lower lymphocyte counts (P &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors of in-hospital death. The proportional hazards model indicated that longer duration of diarrhea (P = 0.002), higher frequency of diarrhea (P = 0.058), higher neutrophil counts (P = 0.001), lower lymphocyte counts (P = 0.035), and decreased proportion of CD8+ T cells (P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with longer illness course of the survivors. Conclusions: Diarrhea patients were more likely to present with neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and cytokine storm and to develop multi-organ damage. The inflammatory patterns were independent factors associated with illness course of the survivors and in-hospital death of severe COVID-19. © 2020 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Coronavirus disease 2019; Diarrhea; Digestive system; Immuno-inflammatory; SARS-CoV-2",,"32602128","J.

Although respiratory tract symptoms are often the initial presentation among kidney transplant recipients who contract COVID-19, other clinical features which may indicate underlying SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, are not uncommon. Hyponatremia can develop and may reflect underlying inflammation. Interferon-6 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 complications and may play a role in the inappropriately higher secretion of antidiuretic hormone leading to hyponatremia. This pathway is the so-called immuno-neuroendocrine interface. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 has been reported in a few case series of non-kidney transplant patients and only one reported kidney transplant recipient. However, the clinical course and prognostic value of hyponatremia in this population are not described in detail. We report a kidney transplant recipient who was infected with COVID-19 and exhibited severe hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia is one of the clinical presentations of COVID-19, although less common, and may occur more frequently in kidney transplant recipients. Thus, the possible underlying immuno-neuroendocrine relationship related to the inflammatory process of COVID-19 leading to hyponatremia and its prognostic value are reviewed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; gastrointestinal symptoms; gut-lung axis; immuno-neuroendocrine interface; kidney transplantation",,"32510756","Transplant Infect.

This human coronavirus (HCov-19) has put the world on high alert as the numbers of confirmed cases are continuously increasing. The world is now fighting against this deadly virus and is leaving no stone unturned to find effective treatments through testing of various available drugs, including those effective against flu, malaria, etc. With an urgent need for the development of potential strategies, two recent studies from China using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia have shed some light on a potential cure for the COVID-19 infected patients. However, MSCs, despite being used in various other clinical trials have always been questioned for their tendency to aggregate or form clumps in the injured or disease microenvironment. It has also been reported in various studies that exosomes secreted by these MSCs, contribute towards the cell’s biological and therapeutic efficacy. There have been reports evaluating the safety and feasibility of these exosomes in various lung diseases, thereby proposing them as a cell-free therapeutic agent. Also, attractive features like cell targeting, low-immunogenicity, safety, and high biocompatibility distinguish these exosomes from other synthetic nano-vesicles and thus potentiate their role as a drug delivery nano-platform. Building upon these observations, herein, efforts are made to give an overview of stem cell-derived exosomes as an appealing therapeutic agent and drug delivery nano-carrier. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the recent evidence and developments in understanding exosomes as a promising candidate for novel nano-intervention in the current pandemic scenario. Furthermore, this review will highlight and discuss mechanistic role of exosomes to combat severe lung pathological conditions. We have also attempted to dwell into the nano-formulation of exosomes for its better applicability, storage, and stability thereby conferring them as off the shelf therapeutic. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Drug delivery; Immuno-modulation; Lung diseases; Nano-formulation; Therapeutics",,,"Stem Cell Rev.

Since nowadays no specific drug therapies neither vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19, drug repositioning may offer a strategy to efficiently control the clinical course of the disease and the spread of the outbreak. In this paper we aim to describe the main pharmacological properties, including data on mechanism of action, safety concerns and drug-drug interactions, of drugs currently administered in patients with COVID-19, focusing on antivirals and drugs with immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 were reported. Several studies have been registered worldwide and a number of drugs were repurposed to face the new health emergency of COVID-19. For many of these drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit in improving patients’ clinical conditions. However, adequate clinical trials are necessary to reach any firm conclusion on the efficacy and safety profiles of these compounds. Even though drug repurposing is necessary, it requires caution. Too many drugs that are currently tested in patients with COVID-19 have peculiar safety profiles. In conclusion, while waiting for the development of effective preventive measures, such as vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. It is conceivable that very soon their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications. This article is protected by copyright.

Interestingly it paves the way for exploring the role of Vitamin-D as an accessible ‘magic bullet’ against nCOVID-19. Currently, its metabolism and immunomodulatory characterization are well-established. In fact, the studies have described an inverse relationship between Vitamin-D level and respiratory infections. This further substantiates for understanding its shielding effect against nCOVID-19.

Two clusters of actions identified were cytokine storm prevention and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding regulation. The multi-target mechanisms of QFPDT for treating viral infection in general and COVID-19 in particular were validated. While large scale clinical studies on QFPDT are being conducted in China, one should use real world data for exploration of integrative treatment with inclusion of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and herb-drug interaction studies.","Bupleurum chinense; Cinnamomum cassia; Coronavirus; Ephedra sinica; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; Pogostemon cablin; QFPDT; Scutellaria baicalensis; Therapeutic Targets","antivirus agent; herbaceous agent; animal; Betacoronavirus; China; Chinese medicine; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; history; human; literature; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; History, Ancient; Humans; Medicine in Literature; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32668969","Am.

On Friday 3rd April, three reports were published on how vitamin D may protect against Covid-19. Two reports are aligned with national and international guidelines on vitamin intake requirements for health: one looked at the importance of vitamin D adequacy in protecting children from respiratory illness but included important advice cautioning against high dose vitamin D; the other is from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) that looked at specific ’at risk’ groups for vitamin D deficiency in those over 50 years in a representative sample from the 26 counties. TILDA provides a strong evidence base for intervening in older adults with supplemental vitamin D (10 µg to 20 µg daily). A third report advises that every adult should take high doses of vitamin D (20 µg to 50 µg daily) in order to protect against Covid-19. The authors make no mention about other sources of vitamin D in adults. This creates confusion at a time when there is widespread fear and anxiety about the Covid-19 pandemic.

We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods: We developed an online repository (COVID Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time the growth rate, geographical distribution, and characteristics of COVID-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints, and study designs. Analyses are publicly available at https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT. Results: We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions: This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth casts doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable results. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for COVID-19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs.

The causative virus of COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2. Recent retrospective clinical studies have established a significant association between the incidence of vascular thrombotic events and the severity of COVID-19. The enhancement in serum levels of markers that reflect a hypercoagulable state has been suggested to indicate a poor prognosis. Therefore, at present, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that foster the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Over-activated inflammatory response, which is manifested as excessive cytokine release in COVID-19 patients, is also associated with COVID-19 severity. This review discusses the immuno-pathological basis of the excessive cytokine release in COVID-19. Besides, this article reviews the role of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines, whose significant elevations in their serum levels have been consistently detected in multiple different clinical studies, in promoting the hypercoagulable state. Since the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is potentially down-regulated in COVID-19, as proposed by a recent bio-informatic analysis, mechanisms through which reduced ACE2 expressions promote vascular thrombosis are summarized. In addition, the reciprocal-enhancing effects of the excessive cytokine release and the downregulated ACE2 expression on their pro-thrombotic activities are further discussed. Here, based on currently available evidence, we review the pathogenic mechanisms of the hypercoagulable state associated with severe cases of COVID-19 to give insights into prevention and treatment of the vascular thrombotic events in COVID-19.

In fact, knowledges of pathophysiology of this new disease are still in development and hence originate discussions and interpretations. Regarding the role of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, these mechanisms should be considered as crucial especially in severe cases. It is proposed to consider two distinct phenotypes of thrombotic manifestations: the current “thromboembolic type” also occurring in other kinds of sepsis, and the diffuse micro-thrombotic type, prevailing in the lungs but sometimes extending to other organs. Both types can induce severe disease and are potentially lethal. The micro-thrombotic pattern, more specific for COVID-19, results from a massive activation of coagulation strictly coupled with a hyper-intense inflammatory and immune reaction. This results in widespread occlusive thrombotic micro-angiopathy with destruction of alveoli and obstructive neoangiogenesis. The involvement of fibrinolysis, often neglected, confers a double faceted process of activation/inhibition, finally conducive to a fibrinolytic shutdown that reinforces persistence of micro-thrombi. Considering these peculiar mechanisms, it seems evident that both prophylactic and therapeutic effects of current anti-thrombotic drugs cannot be taken for granted and need therefore new specific and rigorous controlled trials. © 2020, Società Italiana di Medicina Interna (SIMI).","CID; Coagulation; COVID-19; Fibrinolysis; Immuno-thrombosis; Micro-thrombosis",,,"Intern.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of acute viral respiratory infection and community acquired pneumonia, with several molecular mechanisms proposed to explain this association. Vitamin D supplementation has also been shown to reduce the risk of respiratory infection. Vitamin D and Covid-19 Correction of vitamin D deficiency is thought to suppress CD26, a putative adhesion molecule for Covid-19 host cell invasion. Vitamin D may also attenuate interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) inflammatory responses, both potent predictors of poorer outcome in critically-ill ventilated patients including those with Covid-19. Vitamin D Requirements Irish adults require 25-30µg/d of vitamin D3, an intake not achievable by diet alone, to reliably maintain serum 25(OH)D levels >50nmol/l. Supplementation with doses up to 100µg/d has been shown to be safe for adults, and many agencies and expert groups now advocate supplementation in older adults, albeit at lower levels than this. Conclusions and Recommendations Vitamin D deficiency is common and may contribute to increased risk of respiratory infection including Covid-19. We recommend that all older adults, hospital inpatients, nursing home residents and other vulnerable groups (e.g. those with diabetes mellitus or compromised immune function, those with darker skin, vegetarians and vegans, those who are overweight or obese, smokers and healthcare workers) be urgently supplemented with 20-50µg/d of vitamin D to enhance their resistance to Covid-19, and that this advice be quickly extended to the general adult population. © 2020, Irish Medical Association.

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common, chronic, inflammatory skin conditions, with immune dysregulation as a shared mechanism; therefore, mainstays of treatment include systemic immunomodulating therapies. It is unknown whether these therapies are associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility or worse outcomes in infected patients. In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of nonbiologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and AD and provide therapeutic recommendations. In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered. Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 inhibitors are associated with low infection risk, with IL-17 and IL-23 favored over IL-12/23 inhibitors. Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 blockers are safer than tumor necrosis factor alpha blockers. Apremilast, acitretin, and dupilumab have favorable safety data and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients.

We hypothesize that vitamin D status may influence the severity of responses to Covid-19 and that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe will be closely aligned to Covid-19 mortality. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed (no language restriction) of vitamin D status (for older adults) in countries/areas of Europe affected by Covid-19 infection. Countries were selected by severity of infection (high and low) and were limited to national surveys or where not available, to geographic areas within the country affected by infection. Covid-19 infection and mortality data was gathered from the World Health Organisation. Results Counter-intuitively, lower latitude and typically ‘sunny’ countries such as Spain and Italy (particularly Northern Italy), had low mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and high rates of vitamin D deficiency. These countries have also been experiencing the highest infection and death rates in Europe. The northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden) which receive less UVB sunlight than Southern Europe, actually had much higher mean 25(OH)D concentrations, low levels of deficiency and for Norway and Finland, lower infection and death rates. The correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and mortality rate reached conventional significance (P=0.046) by Spearman's Rank Correlation. Conclusions Optimising vitamin D status to recommendations by national and international public health agencies will certainly have benefits for bone health and potential benefits for Covid-19. There is a strong plausible biological hypothesis and evolving epidemiological data supporting a role for vitamin D in Covid-19. © 2020, Irish Medical Association.

A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach. Method. Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results. Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion. The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks. © 2020 Miyssa I.

Two general underlying mechanisms should be considered. One would be the anti-infectious and immunomodulatory action that it exerts by improving intercellular barriers by stimulating innate immunity, as well as by modulating adaptive immunity. Also, vitamin D reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (INF-γ). More recently, multiple pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated on the actions of vitamin D at the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory level with positive results in studies with influenza, coronavirus, and other respiratory infections. An inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the prevalence of the respiratory infectious disease has been described. Of interest, another mechanistic approach responds to considering the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is exacerbated in COVID-19 infection because the virus binds to the enzyme ACE2, making more angiotensin II available to cause damage. Vitamin D inhibits mediators of RAAS — present in all cells of the body — and by inhibiting ACE activity and increasing ACE2, it lowers angiotensin II levels. We present studies with proposals for recommended doses of vitamin D, and although a single guideline is not specified, the possible benefits are promising. Finally, the purpose of this review is to share this idea with health professionals to ignite the debate and call for critical reflection, so that it can contribute to the undertaking of more and better clinical designs to validate the benefits of using high doses of vitamin D for the benefit of public health and especially in times of crisis for COVID-19. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Arteriosclerosis","Anti-inflammatory effects; COVID-19; Immuno-modulating actions; Prevention; Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; Treatment; Vitamin D",,,"Clin.

Herein, we evaluate the early changes in the inpatient and outpatient oncology clinics to take a snapshot of this collateral damage at Hacettepe University Cancer Institute. Methods: Patients applying the outpatient clinic and outpatient palliative care (OPC) clinic for the first time and patients admitted to inpatient wards in the first 30 days after the first case of COVID-19 in Turkey were evaluated. These data were compared with data from the same time frame in the previous 3 years. Results: The mean number of daily new patient applications to the outpatient clinic (9.87±3.87 vs 6.43±4.03, p<0.001) and OPC clinic (3.87±1.49 vs 1.13±1.46, p<0.001) was significantly reduced compared with the previous years. While the number of inpatient admissions was similar for a month frame, the median duration of hospitalisation was significantly reduced. The frequency of hospitalisations for chemotherapy was higher than in previous years (p<0.001). By comparison, the rate of hospitalisations for palliative care (p=0.028) or elective interventional procedures (p=0.001) was significantly reduced. Conclusion: In our experience, almost all domains of care were affected during the pandemic other than patients' systemic treatments. There were significant drops in the numbers of newly diagnosed patients, patients having interventional procedures and palliative care services, and these problems should be the focus points for the risk mitigation efforts for prevention of care disruptions. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Yet the scarcity of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to infection has led to hesitation on recommending the use of rapid immunodiagnostic tests, even though rapid serology tests are commercially available and scalable. On the basis of our knowledge and understanding of viral infectivity and host response, we urge countries without the capacity to do molecular testing at scale to research the use of serology tests to triage symptomatic patients in community settings, to test contacts of confirmed cases, and in situational analysis and surveillance. The WHO R&D Blue Print expert group identified eight priorities for research and development, of which the highest is to mobilise research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level. This research should inform control programmes of the required performance and utility of rapid serology tests, which, when applied specifically for appropriate public health measures to then be put in place, can make a huge difference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,"32687805","Lancet Infect.

Further research is required to halt progression of multi-organ injury induced by hyper-inflammation. Areas covered: PubMed/MEDLINETM databases were accessed between May 9th-June 9th, 2020, to review the latest perspectives on the treatment and pathogenesis of CRS. Expert opinion: Over-activity of chemotaxis triggers a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and TNF- α are at the forefront of hyper-inflammation. The inflammatory cascade induces endothelial activation and capillary leak, leading to circulatory collapse and shock. As endothelial dysfunction persists, there is activation of the clotting cascade and microvascular obstruction. Continued endothelial activation results in multi-organ failure, regardless of pulmonary tissue damage. We propose that targeting the endothelium may interrupt this cycle. Immuno-modulating therapies have been suggested, however, further data is necessary to confirm that they do not jeopardize adaptive immunity. Inhibition of IL-6 and the Janus Kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins pathway (JAK/STAT), are favorable targets. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces the inflammation of sepsis in animal models and should be considered as a low risk intervention, in combination with cardiovascular protection. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cardiovascular protection; COVID-19; cytokine release Syndrome; Cytokine-Storm; endothelial activation",,"32594778","Expert Opin.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

During the last decade, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the complex neurobiology of the oxytocin system, including oxytocinergic pathways, local release patterns, and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain, as well as intraneuronal oxytocin receptor signaling. However, the picture of oxytocin actions remains far from being complete, and the central question remains: “How does a single neuropeptide exert such pleotropic actions?” Although this phenomenon, typical for many of about 100 identified neuropeptides, may emerge from the anatomical divergence of oxytocin neurons, their multiple central projections, distinct oxytocin-sensitive cell types in different brain regions, and multiple intraneuronal signaling pathways determining the specific cellular response, further basic studies are required. In conjunction, numerous reports on positive effects of intranasal application of oxytocin on human brain networks controlling socio-emotional behavior in health and disease require harmonic tandems of basic researchers and clinicians. During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, oxytocin research seems central as question of social isolation-induced inactivation of the oxytocin system, and buffering effects of either activation of the endogenous system or intranasal application of synthetic oxytocin need to be thoroughly investigated. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,,"32514104","Mol.

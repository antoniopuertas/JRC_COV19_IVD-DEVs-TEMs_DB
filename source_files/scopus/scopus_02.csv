For diagnosis, chest computed tomography is a conventional, noninvasive imaging modality that is very accurate for detection and evaluation of pneumonia and is an important adjunct to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of the virus. Previous studies have reported typical computed tomography imaging features indicative of COVID-19, such as multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation. With the sharply increasing demand for computed tomography examination during the outbreak, ensuring appropriate infection control in radiology departments is challenging. Thus, advanced training and education in standardized infection control and prevention practice are essential. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize such training and education for clinical management of this outbreak for radiology department personnel. We will describe standard transmission-based precautions, workflow for computed tomography examination of fever patients, and decontamination management of a radiology department. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Computed tomography; Coronavirus disease 2019; Fever; Infection control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Human resource management; Personnel training; Polymerase chain reaction; Radiation; Radiology; Viruses; Clinical management; Ground-glass opacity; Non-invasive imaging; Radiology departments; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Standard transmission; Tomography imaging; Training and education; Disease control; Article; Chinese; clinical education; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; decontamination; experience; fever; health care personnel; health care personnel management; human; infection control; infection prevention; instrument sterilization; patient care; priority journal; radiological technologist; radiology department; virus transmission; workflow",,"Clin.

The causative agent (SARS-CoV-2) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a zoonotic transfer. Although, the medium of animal-human transmission is still unknown, bats maybe a potential reservoir of this novel strain. Due to its high rate of transmission the most favorable way of limiting the outbreak’s extent is by early diagnosis followed by isolation of the infected individuals. So far, the most widely used diagnosis methods are RT-qPCR which detects specific sequences of the viral RNA. Some other methods include serological tests and the recently introduced CRISPR-CAS-12 based assays. As of now, no specific therapeutic treatments are known for COVID-19 however the use of some broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and convalescent plasma therapy have demonstrated positive outcomes. Apart from these treatments, vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 is also in progress by 17 known companies.

Several studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool samples of infected patients, and it was also found that the viral receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is highly express in the gastrointestinal cells. These findings suggest that SARS-Cov-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract.

Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the evaluation of COVID-19. This retrospective study aims to determine and compare the pulmonary changes in Iraqi patients with COVID-19 disease across the first two weeks after onset of symptoms using computerized tomography (CT) scan. Ninety-six patients with COVID-19 disease were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the duration of symptoms (the first group has been scanned within the first week of presentation while the second group has been scanned in the second week). Results: The CT findings in the first and second group were as follows: ground glass opacity (GGO) were 94.3% vs. 88.5%, consolidation were 25.7% vs. 34.6%, broncho vascular thickening were 18.6% vs. 7.7%, crazy paving appearance were 15.7% vs. 3.8%, tree-in-bud appearance were 4.3% vs. 10.7%, pulmonary nodules were 5.1% vs. 7.7%, and bronchiectasis were 5.5% vs. 7.7%. Pleural effusion and cavitation were seen only in the first group (2.9% and 1.4% respectively). The distribution of CT changes across the two groups were as follows: bilateral changes were 85.7% vs. 100%; central distribution were 11.4% vs. 11.5%; peripheral distribution were 64.3% vs. 42.3%, and diffuse (central and peripheral) distribution were 24.3% vs. 46.2% while multilobar distribution were 70% vs. 80.8%.

Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes. © 2020","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Physical Activity; Pregnancy; Stress","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Canada; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; distress syndrome; female; human; human relation; life threat; major clinical study; pandemic; physical activity; postnatal depression; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal care; priority journal; social isolation; social support","32777604","J.

Objectives: To describe 3 pediatric Kawasaki Disease patients with false positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. Study design: We retrospectively recruited children with KD diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results including SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were retrieved. We performed a microparticle-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG against nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and a microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Results: Three Chinese children with typical KD were identified. They had no epidemiological links with COVID-19 patients and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPA PCR. They were treated with IVIG and aspirin, and were discharged without complications. Subsequently 2 of them were tested positive against anti-RBD and anti-NP antibodies and 1 was tested positive against anti- RBD antibodies. However, microneutralization assay showed that neutralizing antibodies were absent, suggesting a false-positive IgG result. Conclusion: Detection of neutralizing antibodies is recommended to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in IgG-positive but PCR-negative patients. © 2020 The Authors","Chinese; COVID-19; False positive; Kawasaki disease; Serology",,,"Diagn.

The symptomatology and epidemic profile remain little known in this population, especially in disabled oldest-old people with chronic diseases living in nursing homes. The objective of the present study was to comprehensively describe symptoms and chronological aspects of the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a nursing home, among both residents and caregivers. Design: Five-week retrospective cohort study. Setting: A middle-sized nursing home in Maine-et-Loire, west of France. Participants: Eighty-seven frail older residents (87.9 ± 7.2years; 71 % female) and 92 staff members (38.3 ± 11.7years; 89 % female) were included. Measurements: Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in both residents and staff. Attack rate, mortality rate, and symptoms among residents and staff infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recorded. Results: The attack rate of COVID-19 was 47 % in residents (case fatality rate, 27 %), and 24 % in staff. Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents before spreading to caregivers. Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs (59 % hyperthermia, 49 % cough, 42 % polypnea) together with geriatric syndromes (15 % falls, 10 % altered consciousness). The classification tree revealed 100 % COVID-19 probability in the following groups: i) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls; ii) residents older than 90 with anorexia; iii) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness. Finally, 41 % of staff members diagnosed with COVID-19 were asymptomatic. Conclusions: The pauci-symptomatic expression of COVID-19 in older residents, together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers, justifies mass screening in nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Nursing home; Older adults; Prognosis; SARS-CoV-2; Symptoms","aged; anorexia; arthralgia; Article; caregiver; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; female; frail elderly; human; hyperthermia; hypotension; hypothermia; incidence; major clinical study; male; mass screening; mortality rate; myalgia; nursing home; prevalence; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tachypnea; very elderly",,"Maturitas",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087123672

Hydrogen peroxide is produced physiologically by oral bacteria and plays a significant role in the balance of oral microecology since it is an important antimicrobial agent. In the epithelial cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase catalyzes a reaction leading from hydrogen peroxide to the ion superoxide. The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the NF-κB. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by viral infections. Virus-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in the regulation of the host immune system and the specific oxidant-sensitive pathway is one of the effective strategies against viral infections. Therefore, nose/mouth/throat washing with hydrogen peroxide may enhance those local innate responses to viral infections and help protect against the current coronavirus pandemic. We strongly encourage the rapid development of randomized controlled trials in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative subjects to test the preliminary findings from the in-vitro and in-vivo observational studies that we identified. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Hydrogen peroxide; Innate immunity; SARS-CoV-2; Viruses","hydrogen peroxide; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; ion superoxide; superoxide; superoxide dismutase; toll like receptor; unclassified drug; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epithelium cell; host; human; immunoregulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; innate immunity; mouth epithelium; mouth flora; nonhuman; nose epithelium; oxidative stress; pandemic; randomized controlled trial (topic); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection","32505069","Med.

It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays. Methods: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. Results: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal), the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. Conclusion: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases. © 2020","Convolutional Neural Network; Coronavirus; COVID-19, Pneumonia viral; Deep learning; Pneumonia bacterial","Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep learning; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Detection and diagnosis; Learning models; Overall accuracies; Pre-processing of data; Precision and recall; Wuhan , China; Deep neural networks; Article; bacterial pneumonia; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; follow up; human; major clinical study; preliminary data; radiodiagnosis; support vector machine; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; virus pneumonia","32534344","Comput.

Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods: Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0–8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0–18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development. © 2020","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Maternal; Mental health services","adult; anxiety; Article; child; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; expectant mother; female; human; infant; major clinical study; mental health service; newborn; pandemic; postnatal depression; priority journal; protection; psychological well-being; risk factor","32736186","J.

This study aimed to investigate the role of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) to preview and triage. Methods and Results: A cohort study was designed from government designated COVID-19 treatment center. CAC was defined as International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score ≥2. Data from 117 patients COVID-19 were reviewed on admission. The primary and secondary outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, vital organ dysfunction, discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission and hospital mortality. Among them, admission to ICU was increased progressively from 16.1% in patients with non-CAC to 42.6% in patients with CAC (P < 0.01). Likely, invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation were increased from 1.8%, 21.4% in patients with non-CAC to 21.3%, 52.5% in patients with CAC, respectively (P < 0.01). The incidences of acute hepatic injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in non-CAC and CAC were 28.6% vs. 62.3%, 8.9% vs. 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.01). The discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission were more in non-CAC than those of CAC (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression results showed that ISTH score ≥2 was obviously associated with the admission to ICU (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.47–11.25 P = 0.007) and the use of mechanical ventilation (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.01–15.28 P = 0.001) in patients with COVID-19.

In this comprehensive review we provide a thorough and critical assessment of face masks and face shields, some of the most frequently recommended personal safeguards against viral infection. We begin by describing the function and practicality of the most common mask types used in dentistry: procedural masks, surgical masks, and filtering respirator facemasks (also called N95s). This is followed by a critical assessment of mask use based on a review of published evidence in three key domains: the degree to which each mask type is shown to protect against airborne and aerosolized disease, the reported likelihood for non-compliance among mask users, and risk factors associated with both proper and improper mask use. We use this information to conclude our review with several practical, evidence-based recommendations for mask use in dental and dental educational clinics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Evidence-based review; Infectious disease transmission; N95 respirator; Surgical facemask","Aerosols; Dental equipment; Dentistry; Protective clothing; Respirators; Risk assessment; Surgery; Viruses; Critical assessment; Learning from the pasts; N95 filtering facepiece respirators; Non-compliance; Personal protective equipment; Scoping review; Viral infections; Virus transmission; Information use",,"Saf.

PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. Methods: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. Results: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29 ± 12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4 ± 10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13 ± 0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1 ± 1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. Conclusion: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR. We recommend the use of PAPR together with the N95 mask for healthcare-workers doing longer duties in the hospital wards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide (CO2); Cerebral hemodynamics; Coronavirus disease; COVID-19; Face-mask; Headache; Healthcare workers; N95; Personal protection equipment (PPE); Powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR); Respirator; Transcranial Doppler (TCD)","adult; Article; blood flow velocity; brain function; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; female; headache; health care personnel; hemodynamics; human; major clinical study; male; middle cerebral artery; migraine; priority journal; pulsatility index","32768718","J.

We performed phylogenetic, split network, likelihood-mapping, model comparison, and phylodynamic analyses of the genomes.

Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3′ end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3′ end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated.

The availability of the complete gene sequences of the virus helps to know about the origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. In the present study, we performed bioinformatic analysis of the available gene sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 for the understanding of evolution and molecular characteristics and immunogenic resemblance of the circulating viruses. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for four types of representative viral proteins (spike, membrane, envelope and nucleoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26. The findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exhibited convergent evolutionary relation with previously reported SARS-CoV. It was also depicted that SARS-CoV-2 proteins were highly similar and identical to SARS-CoV proteins, though proteins from other coronaviruses showed a lower level of resemblance. The cross-checked conservancy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes showed significant conservancy with antigenic epitopes derived from SARS-CoV. Descriptive epidemiological analysis on several epidemiological indices was performed on available epidemiological outbreak information from several open databases on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Satellite-derived imaging data have been employed to understand the role of temperature in the environmental persistence of the virus. Findings of the descriptive analysis were used to describe the global impact of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, and the risk of an epidemic in Bangladesh. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bangladesh; Descriptive epidemiology; Evolutionary analysis; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Temperature","epitope; membrane protein; virus antigen; virus envelope protein; virus nucleoprotein; virus spike protein; Article; Bangladesh; bioinformatics; BufCoV HKU26; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental temperature; gene sequence; global disease burden; HCoV 229E; HCoV NL63; HCoV OC43; HKU1; HKU4; HKU5; human; infection risk; major clinical study; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; pandemic; persistent virus infection; phylogeny; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; satellite imagery; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus immunity; virus pathogenesis; virus strain","32622082","Infec.

Clinical data show that in addition to respiratory system damage, some male patients with COVID-19 are also accompanied by abnormal renal function and even renal damage. As the main receptor of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also found to be highly expressed not only in respiratory mucosa and alveolar epithelial cells, but also in renal tubule cells, testicular Leydig cells and seminiferous tubule cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the possibility of infecting the male reproductive system, and the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's semen further confirms this theory. In previous studies, it has been found that ACE2 has the ability to regulate autophagy. Not only that, recent studies have also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to a reduction in autophagy. All of these associate SARS-CoV-2 with autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy has been shown to have an effect on male reproduction in many studies. Based on these, we propose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive function by regulating autophagy. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for future treatment of COVID-19 male patients with reproductive function injury, and it can also prompt medical staff and patients to consciously check their reproductive function. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ACE2; Autophagy; Reproduction; SARS-CoV-2","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; Article; autophagy (cellular); coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; kidney tubule cell; Leydig cell; lung alveolus epithelium cell; male genital system; nonhuman; pandemic; protein expression; reproduction; respiratory mucosa; seminiferous tubule; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"Med.

Study design: In our study, we have evaluated an in-house developed ELISA for the detection of the immunoglobulin classes A, G and M directed against the full-length spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2. For this analysis, we have included 110 sera from patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms or blood donors without symptoms collected at the Austrian Red Cross, Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz. In addition, we have selected four commercially available IgG-based ELISAs as well as one IgA/IgG-based ELISA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as a multiplexed IgG-based micro-ELISA assay developed for rapid Point of Care testing applications. Conclusions: All assays evaluated in the course of this study demonstrated suitable sensitivity and specificity values for the identification of patients that have experienced a past infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: IgM/IgG and total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by a cyclic enhanced fluorescence assay (CEFA) and a microsphere immunoassay (MIA), respectively. Independent performance evaluation included imprecision, reproducibility, specificity and cross-reactivity (CEFA n = 320, MIA n = 364). Clinical utility was evaluated by both methods in 87 patients at initial emergency department visit, 28 during subsequent hospitalizations (106 serial samples), and 145 convalescent patients. Totally 916 patients and 994 samples were evaluated. Results: Agreement of CEFA and MIA was 90.4%-94.5% (Kappa: 0.81–0.89) in 302 samples. CEFA and MIA detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 26.2% and 26.3%, respectively, of ED patients. Detection rates increased over time reaching 100% after 21 days post-symptom onset. Longitudinal antibody kinetic changes by CEFA and MIA measurements correlated well and exhibited three types of seroconversion. Convalescent sera showed a wide range of antibody levels. Conclusion: Rigorously validated CEFA and MIA assays are reliable for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and show promising clinical utility when evaluating immune response in hospitalized and convalescent patients, but are not useful for early screening at patient's initial ED visit. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19); Immunoassay; Serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; adult; antibody blood level; antibody detection; antibody response; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; cyclic enhanced fluorescence assay; emergency ward; female; fluorescence analysis; hospital patient; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; male; microsphere immunoassay; middle aged; New York; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; seroconversion; serum; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","32505774","Clin.

In this study, multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), as one of the artificial intelligence models, has been proposed for the first time for predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. Although this is a challenging task due to significant fluctuations of daily confirmed cases, the results achieved by MGGP are promising. To be more specific, the predicted confirmed cases are acceptably close to the observed values for seven countries considered in this study. Thus, MGGP is suggested for developing estimation models of COVID-19. Furthermore, similarities and differences between the proposed prediction models are presented.

Before and after the samples were inactivated, the levels of IgM and IgG antibodies were measured. Results: The indexes of antibodies after inactivated were significantly higher than those in fresh sera, while the positive rates in all participants or in patients with COVID-19 did not change. The positive coincidence rate, negative coincidence rate and total coincidence rate of IgM antibodies before and after inactivation were 100.00% (55/55), 96.00% (24/25) and 98.75% (79/80), respectively (κ = 0.971, P < 0.001), while those for IgG antibodies were 98.21% (55/56), 91.67% (22/24) and 98.75% (79/80) respectively (κ = 0.910, P < 0.001).

An observational study is ongoing at San Donato Hospital with the aim to evaluate the contribution of MDW in the diagnostic pathway in adult patients entering in the ED setting and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Material and method: COVID-19 symptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients presenting to ED (Emergency Department), have been enrolled consecutively. Whole blood venous samples have been collected on K2 EDTA for MDW determination, at the same time a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection have been collected. Results: One hundred six patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 with MDW mean value of 20.3 ± 3.3, while forty-one were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with higher MDW mean value of 27.3 ± 4.9 (P < 0.005). The ROC curve analysis has been evaluated showing MDW AUC of 0.91. Finally twenty-three patients hospitalized in high-intensity care unit showed an MDW value higher than the eighteen patients presenting few symptoms [28.8 ± 5.3 vs 25.4 ± 3.6 respectively, P < 0.05]. Discussion: Monocytic population, in Covid19 disease, are the first elements of innate immunity to be involved, these changes are the basis of the modification of the MDW, with evident efficacy in term of sensitivity, particularly in the studied Covid19 patients. Moreover the patients hospitalized in high-intensity care unit showed significantly elevated MDW respects to middle or low symptomatic one, suggest including this parameter as prognostic marker or of therapy efficacy, integrated with other laboratory findings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Monocyte distribution width; SARS-CoV-2","edetic acid; virus RNA; adult; Article; blood sampling; cell population; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency ward; female; hospitalization; human; human cell; innate immunity; intensive care unit; Italy; major clinical study; male; monocyte; monocyte count; monocyte distribution width; nonhuman; nose smear; observational study; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; RNA analysis; sensitivity and specificity; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; throat culture","32504637","Clin.

Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated pre-dominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.","COVID-19; Diagnosis; Emerging coronavirus; One Health; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy; Vaccines","alanine aminotransferase; alpha2b interferon; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; C reactive protein; chloroquine; corticosteroid; D dimer; galidesivir; hydroxychloroquine; lactate dehydrogenase; lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; M protein; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; nucleocapsid protein; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; small interfering RNA; tocilizumab; virus envelope protein; adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway epithelium cell; Article; artificial ventilation; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; disease transmission; dyspnea; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; fatigue; fever; genotype; hemoptysis; human; leukocytosis; lymphocytopenia; molecular docking; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; Pholidota (animal); respiratory failure; reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; virus load; virus nucleocapsid; virus pneumonia; virus replication; virus shedding; virus transmission; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32580969","Clin.

Methods: Air and surface samples were collected from the isolation wards and intensive care units designated for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Clinical data and the results of nasopharyngeal specimen and serum antibody testing were also collected for the patient sample. Results: A total of 367 air and surface swab samples were collected from the patient care areas of 15 patients with mild COVID-19 and nine patients with severe/critical COVID-19. Only one air sample taken during the intubation procedure tested positive. High-touch surfaces were slightly more likely to be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA than low-touch surfaces. Contamination rates were slightly higher near severe/critical patients than near mild patients, although this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Surface contamination was still found near the patients with both positive IgG and IgM. Conclusions: Air and surface contamination with viral RNA was relatively low in these healthcare settings after the enhancement of infection prevention and control. Environmental contamination could still be found near seroconverted patients, suggesting the need to maintain constant vigilance in healthcare settings to reduce healthcare-associated infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Environmental contamination; Hospital; Infection control; Personal protective equipment",,"32730827","Int.

The emergence of novel respiratory viruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 creates dramatic challenges to the healthcare services, including surgical pathology laboratories, despite their extensive daily experience in dealing with biological and chemical hazards. Here, we cover important aspects on the knowledge on COVID-19 gathered during the first six months of the pandemic and address relevant issues on human biological sample handling in the Anatomic Pathology laboratory in the context of COVID-19 global threat. In addition, we detail our strategy to minimize the risk of contamination upon exposure to the different biological products received in the laboratory, which can be of general interest to other laboratories worldwide. Our approach has enabled a safe work environment for laboratory staff, while ensuring the maintenance of high quality standards of the work performed. In times of uncertainty and given the lack of specific guidelines directed at Anatomic Pathology services to better deal with the global COVID-19 public-health emergency, it is essential to share with the community rigorous methodologies that will enable us to better cope with probable novel waves of COVID-19 infection and other viruses that will possibly arise in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anatomic Pathology; COVID-19; Cytology; Infection prevention; SARS-CoV-2; Surgical pathology laboratory","Article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; health service; human; infection prevention; infection risk; laboratory test; practice guideline; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; uncertainty; virus transmission; work environment",,"Ann.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ( ± 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git © 2020","COVID-19; Deep learning; Transfer learning; X-ray imaging","Convolutional neural networks; Image analysis; Transfer learning; X ray radiography; Chest radiography; Confusion matrices; Infected patients; Model implementation; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Research communities; Sensitivity and specificity; Specificity rates; Deep learning",,"Med.

All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs.

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods:In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results:The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions:As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chest X-ray; COVID-19; Medical image analysis; Pneumonia; Texture","Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Health care; Image classification; Textures; Computed tomography scan; Health-care system; Hierarchical classification; Identification rates; Multi-class classification; Real-world scenario; Resampling algorithms; Texture descriptors; Computerized tomography; Article; artificial neural network; automation; binarized statistical image feature; binary classification; classification algorithm; classifier; clinical evaluation; computer assisted tomography; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; data base; deep learning; early diagnosis; elongated quinary pattern; feature extraction; gold standard; hierarchical classification; histogram; human; image analysis; local binary pattern; local directional number; local phase quantization; locally encoded transform feature histogram; lung; machine learning; multiclass classification; multilabel classification; oriented basic image feature; pandemic; RYDLS 20 database; scoring system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pathogenesis; virus pneumonia","32446037","Comput.

It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19.

The characteristics of laboratory findings of coronavirus are of great significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. We found indicators that may most effectively predict a non-severe COVID-19 patient develop into a severe patient. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the laboratory findings of severe patients with non-severe patients with COVID-19 from searched articles. Results: Through the analysis of laboratory examination information of patients with COVID-19 from 35 articles (5912 patients), we demonstrated that severe cases possessed higher levels of leukocyte (1.20-fold), neutrophil (1.33-fold), CRP (3.04-fold), PCT (2.00-fold), ESR (1.44-fold), AST (1.40-fold), ALT (1.34-fold), LDH (1.54-fold), CK (1.44-fold), CK-MB (1.39-fold), total bilirubin (1.14-fold), urea (1.28-fold), creatine (1.09-fold), PT (1.03-fold) and D-dimer (2.74-fold), as well as lower levels of lymphocytes (1.44-fold), eosinophil (2.00-fold), monocyte (1.08-fold), Hemoglobin (1.53-fold), PLT (1.15-fold), albumin (1.15-fold), and APTT (1.02-fold). Lymphocyte subsets and series of inflammatory cytokines were also different in severe cases with the non-severe ones, including lower levels of CD4 T cells (2.10-fold) and CD8 T cells (2.00-fold), higher levels of IL-1β (1.02-fold), IL-6 (1.93-fold) and IL-10 (1.55-fold).

According to clinical information, the incidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is limited to date. However, even if a neonate tests negative for SARS-CoV-2, frequent abnormal findings, including fetal and maternal vascular malperfusion, have been reported in cases of COVID-19-positive mothers. Primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, such as syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, and the vascular smooth muscle cells of primary and secondary villi. However other route of transplacental infection cannot be ruled out. Pathological examinations have demonstrated that syncytiotrophoblasts are often infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fetuses are not always infected. These findings suggest the presence of a placental barrier, even if it is not completely effective. As the frequency and molecular mechanisms of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been determined to date, intensive clinical examinations by repeated ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring are strongly recommended for pregnant women infected with COVID-19. In addition, careful investigation of placental samples after delivery by both morphological and molecular methods is also strongly recommended. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Placental barrier; Pregnancy; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; virus antigen; Article; blood placenta barrier; clinical examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotrophoblast; endothelium cell; fetoplacental unit; fetus echography; fetus electrocardiography; fetus growth; fetus malformation; histopathology; human; immunity; incidence; intrauterine growth retardation; nonhuman; placenta tissue; pregnancy complication; pregnant woman; priority journal; protein expression; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; syncytiotrophoblast; vascular smooth muscle cell; vertical transmission","32755724","Placenta",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088864596

The pulmotropic virus causes loss of oxygenation in severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and need for mechanical ventilation. This work seeks to introduce placental extract-derived biologically active components as a therapeutic option and highlights their mechanism of action relevant to COVID-19 virus. Human placenta has been used in clinical practice for over a century and there is substantial experience in clinical applications of placental extract for different indications. Aqueous extract of human placentacontains growth factors, cytokines/chemokines, natural metabolic and other compounds, anti-oxidants, amino acids, vitamins, trace elements and biomolecules, which individually or in combination show accelerated cellular metabolism, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, cellular proliferation and stimulation of tissue regeneration processes. Placental extract treatment is proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach consideringthe above properties which could protect against initial viral entry and acute inflammation of alveolar epithelial cells, reconstitute pulmonary microenvironment and regenerate the lung. We reviewed useful therapeutic information of placental biomolecules in relation to COVID-19 treatment. We propose the new approach of using placental growth factors, chemokines and cytokine which will execute antiviral activity in coordination with innate and humoral immunity and improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19. Executing a clinical trial using placental extract as preventive, protective and/or therapeutic approach for COVID-19treatment could advance the development of a most promising therapeutic candidate that can join the armamentaria against the COVID-19 virus. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-inflammatory; Cellular proliferation; Immunomodulatory; Novel coronavirus COVID-19; Placental extract; Tissue regeneration",,,"Placenta",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089218694

We aimed to assess the surface and equipment contamination by SARS-COV-2 of an emergency department (ED) during the coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: We performed multiple samples from different sites in ED patients care and non-patient care areas with sterile premoistened swabs and used real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). We also sampled the personal protective equipment (PPE) from health care workers (HCWs). Results: Among the 192 total samples, 10 (5.2%) were positive. In patient care areas, 5/46 (10.9%) of the surfaces directly in contact with COVID-19 patients revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 4/56 (7.1%) of the surfaces that were not directly in contact with COVID-19 patients were positive. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present only in the patients’ examination and monitoring rooms. Before decontamination SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present on the saturation clip, the scuff for blood pressure measurement, the stretcher, the plastic screens between patients and the floor. After decontamination, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained on the scuff, the stretcher and the trolleys. All samples from non-patient care areas or staff working rooms were negative. Only one sample from the PPE of the HCWs was positive. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that surfaces and equipment contamination by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an ED during the COVID-19 outbreak is low and concerns exclusively patients’ examination and monitoring rooms, preserving non-patient care areas. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Contamination; COVID-19; Emergency department; Equipment; SARS-CoV-2; Surfaces",,,"Int.

Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients. © 2020 The Author(s)","Antiviral therapy; Case reports; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2 viral load; Viral pneumonia",,"32619764","Int.

The clinical features and treatment of COVID-19 patients remain largely elusive. However, accurate detection is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based test and nucleic acid-based test for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Methods: We retrospectively studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from January 23 to March 1, 2020. Demographic data, clinical records, laboratory tests, and outcomes were collected. Data were accessed by SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in COVID-19 patients. Results: Of 133 COVID-19 patients, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no differences in gender and age among three subgroups. In RT-PCR detection, the positive rate was 65.9%, 71.2%, and 67.6% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas the positive rate of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.5%/93.2%, 82.7%/100%, and 73.0%/97.3% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the IgM and IgG antibodies concentrations were also examined with no differences among three subgroups. Conclusion: The IgM-IgG antibody test exhibited a useful adjunct to RT-PCR detection, and improved the accuracy in COVID-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illness, which provides an effective complement to the false-negative results from a nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis after onsets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; IgM-IgG antibody test; Nucleic acid test; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of illness","immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; nucleic acid; adult; aged; antibody detection; Article; blood analysis; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; human; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture",,"Int.

Due to the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction reagents. Therefore, extraction-free RT-qPCR protocols are urgently needed. Objectives: To establish a rapid RT-qPCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need of RNA extraction suitable for all respiratory materials. Material and methods: Different SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory materials from our routine laboratory were used as crude material after heat inactivation in direct RT-qPCR with the PrimeDirect™ Probe RT-qPCR Mix (TaKaRa). SARS-CoV-2 was detected using novel primers targeted to the E-gene. Results: The protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in crude material used a prepared frozen-PCR mix with optimized primers and 5 µl of fresh, undiluted and pre-analytically heat inactivated respiratory material. For validation, 91 respiratory samples were analyzed in direct comparison to classical RNA-based RT-qPCR. Overall 81.3 % of the samples were detected in both assays with a strong correlation between both Ct values (r = 0.8492, p < 0.0001). The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate by direct RT-qPCR was 95.8 % for Ct values <35. All negative samples were characterized by low viral loads (Ct >35) and/or long storage times before sample processing. Conclusion: Direct RT-qPCR is a suitable alternative to classical RNA RT-qPCR, provided that only fresh samples (storage <1 week) are used. RNA extraction should be considered if samples have longer storage times or if PCR inhibition is observed. In summary, this protocol is fast, inexpensive and suitable for all respiratory materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Crude specimen; Direct RT-qPCR; No RNA extraction; Respiratory materials; SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

A comprehensive strategy – including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment – is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies have reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not yet apparent. Aim: To estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic cases and describe its epidemiological and clinical significance this review systematically examined the published literature on SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Methods: The literature was searched through four scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. Results: Sixty-three studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The majority of the reported studies were from China. However, there was a lack of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological studies, from several countries worldwide, tracing the actual incidence of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. Studies with a large sample size (>1000) estimated that the percentage of people contracting SARS-CoV-2 and likely to be asymptomatic ranged from 1.2–12.9%. However, other studies with a smaller sample size reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 87.9% of COVID-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Most of these studies indicated that asymptopatics are a potential source of infection to the community. Conclusion: This review highlighted the need for more robust and well-designed studies to better estimate COVID-19 incidence among asymptomatic patients worldwide. Early identification of asymptomatic cases, as well as monitoring and tracing close contacts, could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors","Asymptomatic carrier; COVID-19; Incidence; SARS-CoV-2; Viruses","immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; virus antibody; antibody detection; Article; asymptomatic infection; blood donor; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; human; incidence; laboratory diagnosis; nonhuman; nose smear; real time polymerase chain reaction; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; x-ray computed tomography","32623083","Int.

Methods: An outbreak investigation involving 394 residents and 70 staff, was carried out in 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Two point-prevalence surveys were performed one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Results: Overall, 26% (95% CI 22–31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70–336) compared with previous years. Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35–46) of residents as positive for SARS-CoV-2, and of these 43% (95% CI 34–52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11–24) had only atypical symptoms; 4% (95% CI −1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff also tested positive. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in four UK nursing homes was associated with very high infection and mortality rates. Many residents developed either atypical or had no discernible symptoms. A number of asymptomatic staff members also tested positive, suggesting a role for regular screening of both residents and staff in mitigating future outbreaks. © 2020","Care home; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Diagnostic testing; Nursing home; SARS-CoV-2","aged; all cause mortality; anorexia; Article; asymptomatic infection; clinical feature; comorbidity; confusion; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dyspnea; female; fever; frail elderly; human; infection rate; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; nursing home; nursing home patient; nursing home personnel; prognosis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; United Kingdom; very elderly; virus transmission; vomiting","32504743","J.

The virus was detected in 53/71 specimens (74.6%) by direct PCR and in 55/71 specimens (77.5%) by nCoV-DK; the overall concordance rate was 94.4%: 95.2% for nasopharyngeal swab, 95.5% for saliva, and 85.7% for sputum. The nCoV-DK test effectively detects SARS-CoV-2 in all types of sample including saliva, while reducing the time required for detection, labor, and the risk of human error. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; PCR; Saliva; SARS-CoV-2","Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; human; human cell; polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA purification; saliva analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum analysis; throat culture; virus detection","32599282","Int.

We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. Methods: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. Results: 77.8 % of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. Conclusions: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22 % of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Corona virus; COVID-19; Health care workers; Immune response; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 antibodies",,,"J.

Here, we evaluate the clinical performance of five automated immunoassays on a set of clinical samples. Methods: Serum/plasma samples of 75 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 320 pre-pandemic serum samples of healthy blood donors were subjected to two IgG and three total antibody SARS-CoV-2-immunoassays. All test setups were automated workflows. Results: Positivity of assays (onset of symptoms &gt; 10 days) ranged between 68.4 % and 81.6 % (Diasorin 68.4 %, Euroimmun 70.3 %, Siemens 73.7 %, Roche 79.0 % and Wantai 81.6 %). All examined assays demonstrated high specificity of &gt;99 % (Euroimmun, Diasorin: 99.1 %, Wantai: 99.4 %) but only two reached levels above 99.5 % (Roche: 99.7 %, Siemens 100 %). Interestingly, there was no overlap in false positive results between the assays. The strongest correlation of quantitative results was observed between the Diasorin and Euroimmun IgG tests (r2 = 0.76). Overall, we observed no difference in the distribution of test results between female and male patients (p-values: 0.18−0.87). A significant difference between severely versus critically ill patients was demonstrated for the Euroimmun, Diasorin, Wantai and Siemens assays (p-values:0.041). Conclusion: All assays showed good clinical performance. Our data confirm that orthogonal test strategies as recommended by the CDC can enhance clinical specificity. However, the suboptimal rates of test positivity found at time of hospitalization in this cohort underline the importance of molecular diagnostics to rule out/confirm active infection with SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Serology","immunoglobulin G; Article; automation; clinical assessment; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; false positive result; female; hospital patient; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; male; pandemic; predictive value; priority journal; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoassay; sex ratio; workflow","32763809","J.

We recorded their clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, laboratory examination, and treatment in detail. In addition, we provide computed tomographic images of their chest, which are the most serious imaging manifestation among the infants recorded so far. Results: Although both of them eventually recovered and were discharged from the hospital, they were complicated with varying degrees of liver and myocardial injury. In addition, one of them was complicated with mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.

Saliva is an attractive option as an alternative for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), since saliva can be self-collected, is non-invasive, and sample quality is not dependent on the expertise of the collector. Objective: To compare SARS CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva samples. Study design: NPS and paired saliva samples were prospectively collected from symptomatic outpatients suspected of having COVID-19 and were tested by real-time RT-PCR. Results: In total, 35/124 (26.6 %) samples were RT-PCR positive, with 33/35 positive by NPS (sensitivity = 94.3 % (95 % CI 81.4%–99.0%)) and 30/35 by pure saliva (sensitivity = 85.7 % (95 % CI 70.6%–93.7%)), for an overall agreement of 117/124 (94.4 %). The median cycle threshold value was significantly lower for NPS than for saliva (p = 0.0331). A third or more of pure saliva samples from symptomatic patients were thick, stringy, and difficult to pipet. Conclusions: Real-time RT-PCR of pure saliva had an overall sensitivity for SARS CoV-2 RNA detection of 85.7 % when compared to simultaneously collected NPS.

Many available tests lack rigorous evaluation and therefore results may be misleading. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay. Methods: A multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019. Results: The specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4 % and sensitivity of 96.2 % for samples taken 14 days and 97.9 % for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay. Conclusion: Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay which can also measure antibody functionality. © 2020 The Author(s)","Covid19; Immunoassays; Immunology; SARS-CoV-2","immunoglobulin G; nucleocapsid protein; adult; amino terminal sequence; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; receptor binding; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus nucleocapsid","32769024","J.

Early symptoms overlap with other common conditions such as common cold and Influenza, making early screening and diagnosis are crucial goals for health practitioners. The aim of the study was to use machine learning (ML), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a simple statistical test to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from full blood counts without knowledge of symptoms or history of the individuals. The dataset included in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood counts results from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the hospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers to develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. We find that with full blood counts random forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2 patients with high accuracy between populations on regular wards (AUC = 94–95%) and those not admitted to hospital or in the community (AUC = 80–86%). Here, AUC is the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve and a measure for model performance. Moreover, a simple linear combination of 4 blood counts can be used to have an AUC of 85% for patients within the community. The normalised data of different blood parameters from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a decrease in platelets, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and lymphocytes, and an increase in monocytes. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a characteristic immune response profile pattern and changes in different parameters measured in the full blood count that are detected from simple and rapid blood tests. While symptoms at an early stage of infection are known to overlap with other common conditions, parameters of the full blood counts can be analysed to distinguish the viral type at an earlier stage than current rt-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 allow at present. This new methodology has potential to greatly improve initial screening for patients where PCR based diagnostic tools are limited. © 2020 The Authors","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Full blood count; Leukocytes; Machine Learning; Monocytes; SARS-CoV-2; Screening","adult; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; basophil; blood cell count; Brazil; case report; clinical article; eosinophil; female; human; immune response; lymphocyte; machine learning; male; monocyte; nonhuman; patient coding; polymerase chain reaction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thrombocyte; virus typing",,"Int.

Methods: A total of 125 consecutive patients over 20 years of age who were hospitalized for SARS - COV - 2 between 20th March 2020 and 18th May 2020 were included in the study. The data of the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were recorded separately. The duration of QRS and presence of FQRS were evaluated by two experienced cardiologists. The patients were divided into two groups as FQRS positive and FQRS negative considering presence of FQRS. Moreover, the frequency of FQRS in the patients in the inpatient ward and in the intensive care unit were compared with each other. Results: FQRS was found in 24% of the patients who had SARS-COV-2. There was no difference between FQRS positive and negative groups in terms of age and gender. Heart rate was higher in FQRS positive group. C-reactive protein (7.25 ± 6.65 mg/dl vs. 4.80 ± 4.48 mg/dl; p = .02) levels were also significantly higher in the FQRS positive group. In patients with SARS-COV-2, intensive care unit requirement increased with increasing levels of troponin (p < .000). A positive correlation was detected between serum CRP levels and FQRS (r = 0.204, p = .024). Conclusions: The frequency of FQRS is high in patients with SARS - COV - 2. Serum CRP levels increase with increasing frequency of FQRS in patients with SARS - COV - 2 indicating that patients with FQRS are exposed to more inflammation.

However, previous studies on the effect of inactivation on qualitative real-time RT-PCR were conducted with diluted samples rather than clinical samples. The aim of this study was to investigate whether heat inactivation on clinical samples before detection will affect the accuracy of qualitative real-time RT-PCR detection. All 46 throat swab samples from 46 confirmed inpatients were detected by qualitative real-time RT-PCR directly, as well as after heat inactivation.

As the respiratory tract connects to the brain without protection of the blood–brain barrier, SARS-CoV-2 might in the early invasive phase attack the cardiorespiratory centres located in the medulla/pons areas, giving rise to disturbances of respiration and cardiac problems. Furthermore, brainstem regions are at risk to lose their functional integrity. Therefore, long-term neurological as well as psychiatric symptomatology and eventual respective disorders cannot be excluded as evidenced from influenza-A triggered post-encephalitic Parkinsonism and HIV-1 triggered AIDS–dementia complex. From the available evidences for coronavirus-induced brain pathology, this review concludes a number of unmet needs for further research strategies like human postmortem brain analyses. SARS-CoV-2 mirroring experimental animal brain studies, characterization of time-dependent and region-dependent spreading behaviours of coronaviruses, enlightening of pathological mechanisms after coronavirus infection using long-term animal models and clinical observations of patients having had COVID-19 infection are calling to develop both protective strategies and drug discoveries to avoid early and late coronavirus-induced functional brain disturbances, symptoms and eventually disorders. To fight SARS-CoV-2, it is an urgent need to enforce clinical, molecular biological, neurochemical and genetic research including brain-related studies on a worldwide harmonized basis. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Alzheimer’s disease; Brain bank; Brain pathology; Brain stem; Cardiorespiratory centre; Cognitive dysfunction; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Depression; Movement disorders; Multiple sclerosis; Neuroinvasion; Neurological symptoms/disorders; Neuroprotection; Parkinsonism; Parkinson’s disease; Postmortem studies; SARS-CoV-2 brain disorders; Therapy",,"32725545","J.

The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the context of clinical features and comorbidities is understudied. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adult symptomatic cases at Mayo Clinic, eventually achieving cessation of viral RNA shedding (CVS), defined as two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at least 24 h apart. Results: A total of 251 patients were included, median age was 53 years and 59 % female. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were cough, myalgia, dyspnea, fever and chills. Myalgia, cough, anosmia, ageusia and sore throat were common at CVS, but fever and dyspnea were not observed. The median time from symptom onset to CVS was 23 days, and did not differ by symptoms. The weekly cumulative CVS rate was 2, 14, 44, 73, 91 and 95 % at 1–6 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Cough and fever were associated with a positive PCR test if tested within 2 weeks of symptoms (P < 0.05). Patients with asthma or immunosuppression were less likely to achieve CVS if tested 3 weeks into symptoms (P < 0.04). Conclusions: The cumulative CVS rate at 3 weeks from symptom-onset is 44 % in our entire cohort. The findings of our study highlight the low yield of repeating a SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR test within 21 days of a laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; PCR testing; SARSCo-V-2; Viral RNA shedding","immunosuppressive agent; virus RNA; adult; ageusia; anosmia; Article; asthma; chill; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; dizziness; dyspnea; female; fever; headache; hospital patient; human; immunocompromised patient; laboratory diagnosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myalgia; nonhuman; obesity; onset age; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shivering; sore throat; throat culture; virus shedding","32777762","J.

Objectives: Real-life evaluation of these tests is needed. Using 168 samples from patients hospitalized for COVID-19, non-hospitalized patients but infected with SARS-CoV-2, patients participating in screening campaigns, and samples from patients with a history of other seasonal coronavirus infections, we evaluated the clinical performance of 5 serological assays widely used worldwide (WANTAI®, BIORAD®, EUROIMMUN®, ABBOTT® and LIAISON®). Results: For hospitalized patients, all these assays showed a sensitivity of 100 % from day 9 after the symptoms onset. On the other hand, sensitivity was much lower for patients who did not require hospitalization for COVID-19 confirmed by PCR (from 91.6 % for WANTAI® to 69 % for LIAISON®). These differences do not seem to be due to the antigens chosen by the manufacturers but more to the test formats (IgG detection versus total antibodies). In addition, more than 50 days after a positive PCR for CoV-2-SARS the proportion of positive patients seem to decrease. We did not observe any significant cross-reactions for these techniques with the four other seasonal coronaviruses. Conclusion: In conclusion, the evaluation and knowledge of the serological tests used is important and should require an optimized strategy adaptation of the analysis laboratories to best meet patient's expectations in the face of this health crisis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Performance assays; SARS-CoV-2; Serological assays","coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; nucleocapsid protein; virus antibody; virus antigen; antibody detection; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; comparative study; controlled study; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross reaction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus hku1; Human coronavirus NL63; Human coronavirus OC43; major clinical study; medical history; outpatient; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; receptor binding; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; serology","32769023","J.

Methods: From March 4th to April 9th 2020, during the peak of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic, we enrolled a series of 773 patients that performed both non-contrast chest CT and RT-PCR with a time interval no longer than a week due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy, considering RT-PCR as the reference standard. An analysis on the patients with discrepant CT scan and RT-PCR result and on the patient with both negative tests was performed. Results: RT-PCR testing showed an overall positive rate of 59.8 %. CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 90.7 % [95 % IC, 87.7%–93.2%], 78.8 % [95 % IC, 73.8−83.2%], 86.4 % [95 % IC, 76.1 %–88.9 %], 85.1 % [95 % IC, 81.0 %–88.4] and 85.9 % [95 % IC 83.2−88.3%], respectively. Twenty-five/66 (37.6 %) patients with positive CT and negative RT-PCR results and 12/245 (4.9 %) patients with both negative tests were nevertheless judged as positive cases by the clinicians based on clinical and epidemiological criteria and consequently treated. Conclusions: In our experience, in a context of high pre-test probability, CT scan shows good sensitivity and a consistently higher specificity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia than what reported by previous studies, especially when clinical and epidemiological features are taken into account. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Diagnostic X-ray radiology; Sars-CoV-2; Tomography; X-ray computed","adolescent; adult; Article; child; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; epidemic; female; groups by age; human; infant; Italy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; predictive value; priority journal; probability; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; standard; thorax radiography","32738464","Eur.

Methods: 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). Results: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o.

Here, we evaluated Aspergillus PCR input to help classifying IA in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. (2) Methods: 45 COVID-19 patients were prospectively monitored twice weekly for Aspergillus markers and anti-Aspergillus serology. We evaluated the concordance between (Ι) Aspergillus PCR and culture in respiratory samples, and (ΙΙ) blood PCR and serum galactomannan. Patients were classified as putative/proven/colonized using AspICU algorithm and two other methods. (3) Results: The concordance of techniques applied on respiratory and blood samples was moderate (kappa = 0.58 and kappa = 0.63, respectively), with a higher sensitivity of PCR. According to AspICU, 9/45 patients were classified as putative IA. When incorporating PCR results, 15 were putative IA because they met all criteria, probably with a lack of specificity in the context of COVID-19. Using a modified AspICU algorithm, eight patients were classified as colonized and seven as putative IA. (4) Conclusion: An appreciation of the fungal burden using PCR and Aspergillus serology was added to propose a modified AspICU algorithm.

Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms. Methods: We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analyzed using random-effect models. Results: In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case-series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p-value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2% of the cases; ground-glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74% by meta-analysis). Conclusions: More than half of the patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities.

Compared with the nonpregnant group, pregnant patients were admitted to hospital earlier (0.25 vs 11.00 days; P<0.001), presented milder symptoms, had a higher rate of asymptomatic infection (26.7% vs 0%), and shorter length of hospital stay (14.5 vs 17.0 days; P<0.01). Laboratory test results showed that levels of inflammation markers such as white blood cell count, neutrophil count and percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and D-dimer were significantly higher in pregnant women, whereas mean lymphocyte percentage was significantly lower compared with nonpregnant women. Conclusion: In some respects, the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of COVID-19 in pregnant patients seems to be distinctive from their nonpregnant counterparts. Appropriate advice and positive treatment might be critical to the prognosis when dealing with these pregnant patients. Pregnant patients with COVID-19 had their own positive clinical characteristics and special laboratory test results. Responsive medical advice and active treatment for those patients are critical to recovery. © 2020 The Authors.

However, evidence supporting this notion is currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a survey on the risk of COVID-19 in patients with MS and NMOSD. METHODS: The survey was conducted through the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs. There were no alterations in the patients' DMD regimen during January 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, the 3-month period. None of the patients with MS treated with DMDs had COVID-19. However, 2 patients with relapsing NMOSD were diagnosed with COVID-19-related pneumonia. After treatment, both patients recovered from pneumonia and neither patient experienced new attacks due to predisposing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients with MS or NMOSD, irrespective of whether these patients received DMDs. A battery of stringent preventive measures adopted by neurologists to reduce COVID-19 infection in these patients may have contributed to low risk of COVID-19 infection.

However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses. Methods: This was a retrospective study. Two groups of COVID-19 patients (n = 57) and influenza A patients (n = 59) were enrolled. We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics and treatments. Results: The proportions of cough (70.2%), fever (54.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (14.1%) in COVID-19 patients were lower than those of influenza A patients (98.3%, P &lt; 0.001; 84.7%, P &lt; 0.001; and 35.6%, P = 0.007; respectively). In addition, COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower levels of leukocytes (7.87 vs. 9.89 × 109 L–1, P = 0.027), neutrophils (2.43 vs. 5.16 × 109 L–1, P &lt; 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP; 3.7 vs. 15.1 mg/L, P = 0.001) and procalcitonin (PCT; 0.09 vs. 0.68 mm/h, P &lt; 0.001), while lymphocyte levels (4.58 vs. 3.56 × 109 L–1; P = 0.006) were significantly higher compared with influenza A patients. In terms of CT imaging, ground-glass opacification in chest CT was more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza A patients (42.1% vs. 15%, P = 0.032). In contrast, consolidation was more common in influenza A patients (25%) than in COVID-19 patients (5.2%, P = 0.025). Conclusion: The clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of COVID-19 children are milder than those of influenza A children under 5 years. Additionally, imaging results more commonly presented as ground-glass opacities in COVID-19 patients. © 2020","Child; COVID-19; Influenza A; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2","C reactive protein; D dimer; potassium ion; procalcitonin; Article; body temperature; child; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; convulsion; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; female; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; hospital patient; human; influenza A; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil count; pneumonia; preschool child; protein blood level; prothrombin time; retrospective study","32535301","Int.

However, the World health Organization has not recommended corticosteroid in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to conduct a systematic review on the role of corticosteroid in the management of patients of COVID-19. Methods: A systematic electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane and MedRxiv database using specific keywords was made up till June 17, 2020. Full text of all the original articles with supplementary appendix that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and a detailed analysis of results were represented. Results: Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective studies and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted for evaluating the role of corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit and there was a suggestion of significant harm in critical cases in one sub-study. RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases. Conclusions: While the results from retrospective studies are heterogenous and difficult to infer of a definitive protective benefit with corticosteroids, RECOVERY trial found a significantly better outcome with dexamethasone, mostly in severe cases. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to replicate the outcome shown in RECOVERY trial for a substantial conclusion. © 2020 Diabetes India","ARDS; Corticosteroids; COVID-19; Dexamethasone; Methylprednisolone; SARS-CoV-2","antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; hydrocortisone; methylprednisolone; prednisolone; adult respiratory distress syndrome; all cause mortality; Article; Cochrane Library; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; drug megadose; human; intensive care unit; Medline; oxygen therapy; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; ventilated patient",,"Diabetes Metab.

Methods: We enrolled all inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 21 and April 2, 2020, in Daegu Dongsan Hospital. We analyzed their clinical and demographic data, laboratory parameters, radiological findings, symptoms, and treatment outcomes. Results: Of 694 patients, severe cases accounted for 19.7% (137 patients). No severe case was observed among patients aged ≤19 years. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (27%), and cough was the most common symptom (59%). Asymptomatic patients accounted for 14.4% of cases. Lymphopenia, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and albumin were associated with severe outcomes. The first outbreak was mostly associated with younger age groups, and asymptomatic patients mostly showed mild progression. In the second outbreak involving a long-term care facility, both the number of severe patients and the mortality rate were higher. Conclusions: The overall mortality in Daegu was low, which might have resulted from large scale mass screening to detect patients and starting appropriate treatment, including hospitalization for severe cases, and quarantine for asymptomatic patients. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Epidemiology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)",,"32702415","Int.

Methods: The clinical course and viral RNA shedding pattern of 267 consecutive symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital from January 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: The median duration of viral RNA shedding was 12 days (interquartile range 8–16 days) after the onset of illness. Of the 267 patients included in this study, 65.2% had viral RNA clearance within 14 days, 88.8% within 21 days, and 94.4% within 28 days.

Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to experience severe or critical COVID-19 illness and myocardial injury is a key extra-pulmonary manifestation. These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19–positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown. Understanding the natural history and appropriate management of COVID-19 patients presenting with ST elevation is essential to inform patient management decisions and protect healthcare workers. Methods: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, NACMI. This registry will enroll confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI) with new ST-segment elevation or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG with clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. We will compare demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of these patients with a historical control group of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium using propensity matching. The primary clinical outcome will be in- hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, recurrent MI, and repeat unplanned revascularization in COVID-19 confirmed or PUI. Secondary outcomes will include the following: reporting of etiologies of ST Elevation; cardiovascular mortality due to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and /or shock; individual components of the primary outcome; composite primary outcome at 1 year; as well as ECG and angiographic characteristics. Conclusion: The multicenter NACMI registry will collect data regarding ST elevation on ECG in COVID-19 patients to determine the etiology and associated clinical outcomes.

Study design: The positive rate of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection (IgG and IgM) were compared in suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 71 patients with suspected COVID-19 were selected to participate in this study, which included a retrospective analysis of clinical features, imaging examination, laboratory biochemical examination and nucleic acid detection and specific antibody (IgM and IgG) detection. Results: The majority of participants with suspected COVID-19 presented with fever (67.61%) and cough (54.93%), and the imaging results showed multiple small patches and ground-glass opacity in both lungs, with less common infiltration and consolidation opacity (23.94%). Routine blood tests were mostly normal (69.01%), although only a few patients had lymphopenia (4.23%) or leucopenia (12.68%).

Methods: This retrospective study included all health care workers at King Abdullah University Hospital who take care of patients infected with COVID-19 patients from March 18, 2020 to April 29, 2020. They were tested for COVID-19 infection by use of real-time reverse-transcriptase rRT-PCR on samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: A total number of 370 health care workers were screened. The majority were nurses followed by physicians and other personnel. This study showed that all asymptomatic health care workers were tested negative for COVID-19Q. Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the prevalence of positive COVID-19 among asymptomatic health care workers who take care of patients infected with the novel coronavirus was 0%. This result must be cautiously interpreted. Further studies are needed in order to find effective strategy of screening health care workers to insure a safe working environment. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Health care workers; KAUH","adult; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; female; health care personnel; human; major clinical study; male; pandemic; prevalence; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study",,"Ann.

Methods: A spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases by 250 districts in South Korea from January 20 to May 31, 2020, obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and each provincial website, was conducted. The global Moran's I statistic was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the retrospective space-time scan statistic was used to analyze spatiotemporal clusters of COVID-19. Results: The geographical distribution showed strong spatial autocorrelation, with a global Moran's I coefficient of 0.784 (p = 0.0001). Twelve statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters were identified by space–time scan statistic using a discrete Poisson model. The spatial pattern of clusters changed and the duration of clusters became shorter over time. Conclusions: The results indicate that South Korea's containment strategy for COVID-19 was highly effective in both early detection and mitigation, with recent clusters being small in size and duration.

The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective study to investigate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: The authors reviewed the medical records of hospitalized patients who were treated at 5 hospitals in Wuhan City, China, between January 5 and March 18, 2020. Clinical parameters relating to cancer history (type and treatment) and COVID-19 were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary analyses were the association between clinical factors and severe COVID-19 and OS. Results: A total of 107 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 66 years (range, 37-98 years). Lung (21 patients; 19.6%), gastrointestinal (20 patients; 18.7%), and genitourinary (20 patients; 18.7%) cancers were the most common cancer diagnoses. A total of 37 patients (34.6%) were receiving active anticancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas 70 patients (65.4%) were on follow-up. Overall, 52.3% of patients (56 patients) developed severe COVID-19; this rate was found to be higher among patients receiving anticancer treatment than those on follow-up (64.9% vs 45.7%), which corresponded to an inferior OS in the former subgroup of patients (hazard ratio, 3.365; 95% CI, 1.455-7.782 [P =.005]). The detrimental effect of anticancer treatment on OS was found to be independent of exposure to systemic therapy (case fatality rate of 33.3% [systemic therapy] vs 43.8% [nonsystemic therapy]). Conclusions: The results of the current study demonstrated that >50.0% of infected patients with cancer are susceptible to severe COVID-19. This risk is aggravated by simultaneous anticancer treatment and portends for a worse survival, despite treatment for COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: Clinical characteristics and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 86 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. The chronological analysis method was used to detail neurosensory dysfunction. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to approximately indicate viral load. Results: Forty-four (51.2%) patients had neurosensory dysfunction: hyposmia (34, 39.5%), hypogeusia (33, 38.4%), and tinnitus (three, 3.5%). Neurosensory dysfunction was significantly more common in patients under 40 years old (p = 0.001) and women (p = 0.006). Hyposmia and hypogeusia coexisted in 23 (26.7%) patients. The interval between onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 0.7 ± 1.46 days. The interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to typical COVID-19 symptoms was 0.22 ± 4.57 and 0.75 ± 6.77 days; the interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to admission was 6.06 ± 6.68 and 5.76 ± 7.68 days; and the duration of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 9.09 ± 5.74 and 7.12 ± 4.66 days, respectively. The viral load was high following symptoms onset, peaked within the first week, and gradually declined.

Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold’s abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? Methods: Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. Results: Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. Conclusions: Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.

It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19. Methods: This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map. Results: The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran's fatality rate (deaths/0.1 M pop) is 10.53. Other countries’ fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium – 83.32, UK – 61.39, Spain – 58.04, Italy – 56.73, Sweden – 48.28, France – 45.04, USA – 35.52, Canada – 21.49, Brazil – 20.10, Peru – 19.70, Chile – 16.20, Mexico– 12.80, and Germany – 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1 M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran's shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran's provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables’ importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month. Conclusions: We believe that this study's risk maps are the primary, fundamental step to take for managing and controlling COVID-19 in Iran and its provinces. © 2020 The Authors","Heatmap; Iran; Outbreak trend; Regression model; Risk map; Spatial modeling","adult; aged; Article; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Chile; China; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; female; France; Germany; growth rate; human; Iran; Italy; machine learning; major clinical study; male; Mexico; middle aged; mortality; mortality rate; Peru; population density; random forest; Spain; Sweden; trend study; United Kingdom; United States; validation study; World Health Organization","32574693","Int.

We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th–April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). Results: Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. Conclusions: NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources.

These are addressing the unmet needs of healthcare and public health system including contact tracing, health information dissemination, symptom checking and providing tools for training healthcare providers. Here we provide an overview of mobile applications being currently utilized for COVID-19 and their assessment using the Mobile Application Rating Scale. We performed a systematic review of the literature and mobile platforms to assess mobile applications currently utilized for COVID-19, and a quality assessment of these applications using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) for overall quality, Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, and Information. Finally, we provide an overview of the key salient features that should be included in mobile applications being developed for future use. Our search identified 63 apps that are currently being used for COVID-19. Of these, 25 were selected from the Google play store and Apple App store in India, and 19 each from the UK and US. 18 apps were developed for sharing up to date information on COVID-19, and 8 were used for contact tracing while 9 apps showed features of both. On MARS Scale, overall scores ranged from 2.4 to 4.8 with apps scoring high in areas of functionality and lower in Engagement. Future steps should involve developing and testing of mobile applications using assessment tools like the MARS scale and the study of their impact on health behaviours and outcomes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Contact tracing; COVID-19; Mobile application rating scale; Pandemic; Smartphone application",,"32779002","J.

Methods: Paediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 15 and March 15, 2020, from seven hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, were collected retrospectively and analysed. Results: Thirty-two children with COVID-19, ranging in age from 3 months to 18 years, were enrolled. Family aggregation occurred in 87.5% of infant and preschool-aged children (7/8), and also school-aged children (14/16), but in only 12.5% (1/8) of adolescents (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.001). Most of these patients had mild symptoms: mainly fever (20/32) followed by cough (10/32) and fatigue (4/32). The average durations of viral RNA in respiratory samples and gastrointestinal samples were 15.8 d and 28.9 d, respectively. Detox duration in faeces decreased with age: 39.8 d, 27.5 d and 20.4 d in infants and preschool children, school children, and adolescents respectively (p0–6, –18 &lt;0.01, p0–6, –14 &lt;0.05). Pneumonia was found in 14 children, but there was no statistical significance in the incidence of pneumonia between different age groups. Thirty patients were treated with antiviral drugs, and all patients were stable and gradually improved after admission. Conclusions: Most children with COVID-19 had a mild process and a good prognosis. More attention should be paid to investigation of household contact history in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in young children. Viral RNA lasts longer in the gastrointestinal system than in the respiratory tract, especially in younger children. © 2020 The Author(s)","Child; Coronavirus disease-19; Diagnosis; Outcome; Treatment",,"32599159","Clin.

With no vaccine in sight, the spread of the virus is likely to continue unabated. This article aims to analyze the time series data for top five countries affected by the COVID-19 for forecasting the spread of the epidemic. Material and methods: Daily time series data from 15th February to June 30, 2020 of total infected cases from the top five countries namely US, Brazil, India, Russia and Spain were collected from the online database. ARIMA model specifications were estimated using Hannan and Rissanen algorithm. Out of sample forecast for the next 77 days was computed using the ARIMA models. Results: Forecast for the first 18 days of July was compared with the actual data and the forecast accuracy was using MAD and MAPE were found within acceptable agreement. The graphic plots of forecast data suggest that While Russia and Spain have reached the inflexion point in the spread of epidemic, the US, Brazil and India are still experiencing an exponential curve. Conclusion: Our analysis shows that India and Brazil will hit 1.38 million and 2.47 million mark while the US will reach the 4.29 million mark by 31st July. With no effective cure available at the moment, this forecast will help the governments to be better prepared to combat the epidemic by ramping up their healthcare facilities. © 2020 Diabetes India","ARIMA; COVID-19; Forecasting; Pandemic; SARV-2 Cov","Article; autocorrelation; biosurveillance; Brazil; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; econometric model; forecasting; health care facility; human; India; priority journal; random error; Russian Federation; Spain; time series analysis","32755845","Diabetes Metab.

Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020. Methods: The pandemic progression was quantified using the time-dependent reproductive number (R(t)). The spatiotemporal scan statistic model was used to identify local clustering events. Variability in transmission dynamics was accounted for within and between two socioeconomic classes: citizens-residents and migrant workers. Results: The pandemic size in Kuwait continues to grow (R(t)s ≥2), indicating significant ongoing spread. Significant spreading and clustering events were detected among migrant workers, due to their densely populated areas and poor living conditions. However, the government's aggressive intervention measures have substantially lowered pandemic growth in migrant worker areas. However, at a later stage of the study period, active spreading and clustering events among both socioeconomic classes were found. Conclusions: This study provided deeper insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Kuwait and provided an important platform for rapid guidance of decisions related to intervention activities. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Migrant worker; Spatiotemporal cluster; Surveillance; Time-dependent reproductive number","adult; Article; citizen group; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; female; government; human; Kuwait; major clinical study; male; middle aged; migrant worker; pandemic; social class; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical model","32619761","Int.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Imaging departments in the UK were contacted and asked to record the number of preoperative CT examinations performed in patients being considered for both emergency and elective surgical intervention over a 5-day period in May 2020. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of departments replied with data provided on >820 patients. Nineteen percent of additional preoperative CT was in patients undergoing elective intervention and 81% in patients presenting with surgical abdominal pain. There was a high rate of false positives in patients who tested negative for COVID-19, producing a sensitivity for thoracic CT of 68.4%. CONCLUSION: This UK-wide audit demonstrates that a large number of additional thoracic imaging examinations over a 5-day period were performed with a low sensitivity for the identification of COVID-19 in this preoperative group of patients. Given these findings, it is difficult to justify this additional examination in this group of patients. © 2020",,"abdominal pain; Article; clinical audit; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; elective surgery; emergency surgery; false positive result; human; major clinical study; postoperative pain; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity analysis; United Kingdom; x-ray computed tomography","32600651","Clin.

This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. Methods: An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). Results: In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off ≥10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off ≥10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off ≥15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia.

We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories. Methods: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were assessed using generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored using interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. Results: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. The relationship between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001), but this was not the case with gender groups. People aged 20–39 years led the epidemic processes in South Korean society with two peaks — one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above trailed behind that of the younger age group, and with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations in case counts among young adults. Conclusions: Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic throughout society, with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from infection after the peak of the epidemic. © 2020 The Author(s)","Age interaction; COVID-19; Elderly; Epidemic dynamics; Gender interaction; Generalized additive model; Negative binomial distribution; South Korea","adolescent; adult; age; age distribution; aged; Article; binomial distribution; child; coronavirus disease 2019; cross validation; epidemic; exploratory research; female; gender; geriatric patient; human; illness trajectory; incubation time; infant; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; maximum likelihood method; newborn; pandemic; Poisson distribution; population dynamics; retrospective study; sex difference; South Korea; South Korean; young adult","32623081","Int.

Teledentistry can offer an innovative solution to resume dental practice during this pandemic. In this review, we provide a brief overview of applications of teledentistry. Methods: Articles on teledentistry, relevant to this review, were searched and consulted from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database. Results: Teledentistry is the remote facilitating of dental treatment, guidance, and education via the use of information technology instead of direct face-to-face contact with patients. Teleconsultation, telediagnosis, teletriage, and telemonitoring are subunits of teledentistry that have important functions relevant to dental practice. There are many challenges for acceptance of teledentistry by the dentists as well as patients, which need to be addressed urgently. Conclusion: Teledentistry can offer a novel solution to resume dental practice during the current pandemic, hence, the need of the hour is to incorporate teledentistry into routine dental practice. If not fully replace, at least teledentistry can complement the existing compromised dental system during the current pandemic. © 2020 Diabetes India","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Teledentistry; Telehealth; Telemedicine","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; dental patient; dental practice; dental procedure; dentist; dentistry; emergency health service; health care personnel; human; information technology; medical education; pandemic; patient attitude; priority journal; systematic review; telecommunication; teleconsultation; teledentistry; telediagnosis; telemedicine; telemonitoring; teletriage","32593116","Diabetes Metab.

Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41–1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25–30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66–1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban.

It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery. Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment). The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons. Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia. Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms. Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs. Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h). For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done. Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases. When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case. Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times. Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned. In conclusion, this review shows that while COVID-19 is prevalent, it will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"aerosol; ambulatory surgery; anesthetic recovery; Article; bronchoscopy; clinical decision making; coronavirus disease 2019; decontamination; general anesthesia; human; infection control; nerve block; pandemic; postanesthesia care; priority journal; recovery room; surgical technique; team nursing; turnover rate; working time","32371331","J.

Respiratory tract infection is one of the commonest causes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). There has not been evidence suggesting the link between COVID-19 and AECOPD, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing. Methods: This is a retrospective study to assess the number of admissions of AECOPD in the first three months of 2020 in Queen Mary Hospital with reference to the admissions in past five years. Log-linear model was used for statistical inference of covariates, including percentage of masking, air quality health index and air temperature. Results: The number of admissions for AECOPD significantly decreased by 44.0% (95% CI 36.4%–52.8%, p < 0.001) in the first three months of 2020 compared with the monthly average admission in 2015–2019. Compare to same period of previous years, AECOPD decreased by 1.0% with each percent of increased masking (p < 0.001) and decreased by 3.0% with increase in 1 °C in temperature (p = 0.045). The numbers of admissions for control diagnoses (heart failure, intestinal obstruction and iron deficiency anaemia) in the same period in 2020 were not reduced. Conclusions: The number of admissions for AECOPD decreased in first three months of 2020, compared with previous years. This was observed with increased masking percentage and social distancing in Hong Kong. We postulated universal masking and social distancing during COVID-19 pandemics both contributed in preventing respiratory tract infections hence AECOPD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Coronavirus disease 2019; Hospitalization","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; disease severity; heart failure; Hong Kong; hospital admission; human; infection control; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; intestine obstruction; iron deficiency anemia; length of stay; major clinical study; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; retrospective study; risk factor; social distance; virus detection",,"Respir.

The purpose of our study was to assess the implementation and patient acceptability of video consultation for outpatient ophthalmic care at our institution. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis and patient survey of adult patients who completed a virtual video visit at our institution from 18 March 18 through to 27 April 2020. All video visit encounters were assessed for patient characteristics, diagnoses, management, and follow-up outcomes. Patients were surveyed for their feedback on acceptability and utility of their virtual video consultation. Results: A total of 219 patients (mean age 55 years; range 21–89 years) completed 231 video visit encounters at our department over a 6-week period, of whom 118 were women (54%). About half of these encounters were acute visits (102 visits, 47%). The most common diagnosis of these visits was postoperative state (20 visits, 9% of the total), followed by conjunctivitis (16 visits, 7%), and keratitis (14 visits, 6%). The most common management decisions were medication prescription (102 visits, 46%) or reassurance (86 visits, 39%), while 17 video visit patients (8%) were escalated to an urgent, in-person evaluation. Ninety-two patients completed a follow-up survey (42% response rate), of whom 45 (49%) indicated that they might have delayed seeking care during this pandemic in the absence of a virtual video option. Seventy-two (78%) reported that they would consider participating in a video visit as an alternative to an office-based encounter in the future, and the overall video visit experience was rated highly, with a weighted mean Likert scale rating of 4.3 out of 5 (Cronbach’s α = 0.88). Conclusion: Virtual video visits may be used to manage a range of ophthalmic complaints. Patients participating in this survey found such video visits acceptable and timesaving, and the majority would consider using video consultations for future eyecare encounters. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; Patient-reported outcomes; Telemedicine; Teleophthalmology; Video visits; Web-based vision testing",,,"Ophthalmol.

This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases. Methods: Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM). Results: Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD = −0.42, 95%CI −0.60 to −0.25, p < 0.00001, SMD = −0.23, 95%CI −0.41 to −0.06, p = 0.01, SMD = −0.54, 95%CI −0.91 to −0.16, p = 0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD = −0.56, 95%CI −0.71 to −0.40, p < 0.0001, SMD = −0.32, 95%CI −0.49 to −0.15, p = 0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD = 0.31, 95%CI 0.07–0.56, p = 0.01; SMD = 0.44, 95%CI 0.24–0.64, p < 0.0001; SMD = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31–0.75, p < 0.00001; SMD = 0.97, 95%CI 0.70–1.24, p < 0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19. Conclusions: In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis. Low leukocyte and neutrophil counts are markers of COVID-19 infection, but contrastingly higher counts indicate progressive COVID-19. And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and CRP levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of COVID-19. Confirmation of these findings should be performed in future studies. © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","COVID-19; Diagnosis; Laboratory parameters; SARS-CoV-2","C reactive protein; D dimer; procalcitonin; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease severity; human; laboratory test; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; neutrophil count; platelet count; prognosis","32586670","Med.

Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 × 1011 viral particles per mL or 5 × 1010 viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389. Findings: 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1 × 1011 viral particles n=253; 5 × 1010 viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2–749·2) and 571·0 (467·6–697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93–98) and 97% (92–99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 16·8–22·7) and 18·3 (14·4–23·3) in participants receiving 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85–93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81–92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 × 1011 and 5 × 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 × 1011 viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5 × 1010 viral particles dose group. No serious adverse reactions were documented. Interpretation: The Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 5 × 1010 viral particles is safe, and induced significant immune responses in the majority of recipients after a single immunisation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs involved in the first management of infected patients and to describe the measures adopted to prevent the transmission in the hospital. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted between February 21 and April 16, 2020, in the Padua University Hospital (north-east Italy). The infection control policy adopted consisted of the following: the creation of the “Advanced Triage” area for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 cases, and the implementation of an integrated infection control surveillance system directed to all the healthcare personnel involved in the Advance Triage area. HCWs were regularly tested with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; body temperature and suggestive symptoms were evaluated at each duty. Demographic and clinical data of both patients and HCWs were collected and analyzed; HCWs’ personal protective equipment (PPE) consumption was also recorded. The efficiency of the control strategy among HCWs was evaluated identifying symptomatic infection (primary endpoint) and asymptomatic infection (secondary endpoint) with confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2. Results: 7595 patients were evaluated in the Advanced Triage area: 5.2% resulted positive and 72.4% was symptomatic. The HCW team was composed of 60 members. A total of 361 nasopharyngeal swabs were performed on HCWs. All the swabs resulted negative and none of the HCWs reached the primary or the secondary endpoint. Conclusions: An integrated hospital infection control strategy, consisting of dedicated areas for infected patients, strict measures for PPE use and mass surveillance, is successful to prevent infection among HCWs. © 2020 by the authors.

The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits, followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and, alternatively, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform. Comparable viral RNA detection sensitivity and specificity were obtained by fluorescent and colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) using a primer set targeting the N gene, as well as RT-qPCR using a primer set targeting the E gene, showing that the RNA extraction protocol presented here can be combined with a variety of detection methods at high throughput.

Since the initial outbreak, strategies to detect and isolate patients have been important to avoid uncontrolled viral spread. Although testing capacities have been upscaled, there is still a need for reliable high throughput test systems, specifically those that require alternative consumables. Therefore, we tested and compared two different methods for the detection of viral PCR products: rRT-PCR and mass spectrometry (MS). METHODS: Viral RNA was isolated and amplified from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were analyzed by MS. Results of the rRT-PCR and the MS protocol were compared. RESULTS: Results of rRT-PCR and the MS test system were in concordance in all samples. Time-to-results was faster for rRT-PCR. Hands-on-time was comparable in both assays. CONCLUSIONS: MS is a fast, reliable and cost-effective alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs.","COVID19; mass spectrometry; SARS-CoV2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"32759673","Viruses",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089170209

Two specimen panels from serum samples sent to Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) were compiled: the patient panel (N=70) included sera from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the negative panel (N=81) included sera sent for screening of autoimmune diseases and respiratory virus antibodies in 2018 and 2019. The MNT was carried out for all COVID-19 samples (70 serum samples, 62 individuals) and for 53 samples from the negative panel. Forty-one out of 62 COVID-19 patients showed neutralising antibodies.The specificity and sensitivity values of the commercial tests against MNT, respectively, were as follows: 95.1 %/80.5 % (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 94.9 %/43.8 % (Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG; RUO), 68.3 %/87.8 % (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA), 86.6 %/70.7 % (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 74.4 %/56.1 % (Acro 2019-nCoV IgG), 69.5 %/46.3 % (Acro 2019-nCoV IgM), 97.5 %/71.9 % (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and 88.8 %/81.3 % (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgM).

Accurate and fast test results may permit more efficient use of protective and isolation resources and allow rapid therapeutic interventions. We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test, a rapid, automated molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. Analytical sensitivity and specificity/interference were assessed with infectious SARS-CoV-2; other infectious coronavirus species, including SARS-CoV; and 85 nasopharyngeal swab specimens positive for other respiratory viruses, including endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs). Clinical performance was assessed using 483 remnant upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens previously analyzed by standard-of-care (SOC) NAATs. The limit of detection of the Xpert test was 0.01 PFU/ml. Other hCoVs, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, were not detected by the Xpert test. SARS-CoV, a closely related species in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, was detected by a broad-range target (E) but was distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-specific N2 target). Compared to SOC NAATs, the positive agreement of the Xpert test was 219/220 (99.5%), and the negative agreement was 250/261 (95.8%). A third tie-breaker NAAT resolved all but three of the discordant results in favor the Xpert test.

Abbott Molecular developed and received emergency use authorization (EUA) to deploy the new RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay, run on the automated m2000sp/rt system. Objective: To evaluate analytical and clinical performance of the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay compared to the SARS-CoV-2 CDC-based laboratory developed test (LDT) in clinical use by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory (UW Virology). Methods: RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay limit of detection (LOD) was evaluated by testing two dilution panels of 60 replicates each. Cross-reactivity was evaluated by testing 24 clinical samples positive for various non‒SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. Clinical performance was evaluated using 30 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples previously tested using the UW Virology SARS-CoV-2 LDT. Results: Exceeding the 100 copies/mL LOD reported in the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay EUA product insert, 19 of 20 replicates were detected at 50 copies/mL and 16 of 20 replicates were detected at 25 copies/mL. All clinical samples positive for 24 non‒SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses were SARS-CoV-2 negative on the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay. The assay had high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (100%) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. Two positive samples that tested negative with the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay had cycle numbers of 35.94 or greater and required dilution prior to testing. One of these samples was also inconclusive on the SARS-CoV-2 LDT. Conclusion: The RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay is acceptable for clinical use. With the high-throughput, fully automated m2000 system, this assay will accelerate the pace of SARS-CoV-2 testing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; EUA; High-throughput assay; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","virus RNA; virus RNA; Abbott Realtime SARS-CoV-2 assay; Article; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; dilution; high throughput analysis; human; Human adenovirus 2; Human parainfluenza virus 1; Human parainfluenza virus 3; Human parainfluenza virus 4; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; intermethod comparison; laboratory test; limit of detection; Metapneumovirus; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory virus; Rhinovirus; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus recombinant; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; high throughput screening; isolation and purification; laboratory automation; laboratory technique; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; procedures; university hospital; virus pneumonia; Washington; Automation, Laboratory; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Hospitals, University; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Washington","32504946","J.

The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly nonspecific, and symptoms overlap those of other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population. Furthermore, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19-positive patients.

Discrepant results were adjudicated by medical record review. A total of 200 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport medium (VTM) were collected from symptomatic patients between 27 March and 9 April 2020. Results were concordant for 167 specimens (83.5% overall agreement), including 94 positive and 73 negative specimens. The ACOV assay yielded 33 additional positive results, 25 of which were also positive by the CDC COV assay but not by the IDNOW assay. In a follow-up evaluation, 97 patients for whom a dry nasal swab specimen yielded negative results by IDNOW had a paired nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected in VTM and tested by the ACOV assay; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 (13.4%) of these specimens.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and three Chinese biomedical databases were searched up to 25 March 2020 with no language restriction. We included original observational studies that reported the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients. Two separate reviewers conducted the review. Metaprop was adopted to conduct a meta-analysis of prevalence with variances stabilized by Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation. A random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity across different studies was computed using Cochran's Q test and chi square statistics. Results: From 17 studies, the pooled detection rate of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 43.7% (95% CI 32.6%-55.0%) and 33.7% (95% C.I. 33.7%, 95% C.I. 20.1%-48.8%) by patient and number of specimens as a unit count, respectively. Female individuals (59.6% vs. 53.5%), those who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (77.1% vs. 57.7%), and patients with more severe disease (68.3% vs. 34.6%) tended to have a higher detection rate. Discussion: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients carry SARS-CoV-2 in their intestinal tract. Feces being a self-collected specimen bears a potential to improve case identification in community, especially for young children where proper respiratory sampling at home is difficult. Specific infection control strategies focusing on spread via fecal contamination and faulty toilet drainage are urgently needed. © 2020","COVID-19; detection rate; faecal specimen; meta-analysis; SARS-CoV-2","virus RNA; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; disease course; disease severity; feces analysis; gastrointestinal symptom; human; prevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social status; systematic review","32535156","J.

As part of the worldwide response, many molecular diagnostic platforms have been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Our objective was to evaluate three sample-to-answer molecular diagnostic platforms (Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [Xpert Xpress], Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 [ID NOW], and GenMark ePlex SARS-CoV-2 Test [ePlex]) to determine analytical sensitivity, clinical performance, and workflow for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from 108 symptomatic patients. We found that Xpert Xpress had the lowest limit of detection (100% detection at 100 copies/ml), followed by ePlex (100% detection at 1,000 copies/ml), and ID NOW (20,000 copies/ml). Xpert Xpress also had highest positive percent agreement (PPA) compared to our reference standard (98.3%) followed by ePlex (91.4%) and ID NOW (87.7%). All three assays showed 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). In the workflow analysis, ID NOW produced the lowest time to result per specimen (17 min) compared to Xpert Xpress (46 min) and ePlex (1.5 h), but what ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance. ePlex had the longest time to results and showed a slight improvement in PPA over ID NOW. Information about the clinical and analytical performance of these assays, as well as workflow, will be critical in making informed and timely decisions on testing platforms. © 2020 Zhen et al.

Focusing on IgG and total antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of four automated immunoassays (Abbott Architect™ i2000 (N protein-based)), Roche cobas™ e 411 analyzer (N protein-based, not differentiating between IgA, IgM or IgG antibodies), LIAISON®XL platform (S1 and S2 protein-based), VIRCLIA® automation system (S1 and N protein-based) in comparison to two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG (S1 protein-based) and Virotech SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (N protein-based)) and an in-house developed plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. When calculating the overall sensitivity, in a time frame of 49 days after first PCR-positivity, the PRNT as gold standard, showed the highest sensitivity with 93.3% followed by the dual-target assay for the VIRCLIA® automation system with 89%. The overall sensitivity in the group of N protein-based assays ranged from 66.7 to 77.8% and in the S protein-based-assays from 71.1 to 75.6%. Five follow-up samples of three individuals were only detected in either an S and/or N protein-based assay, indicating an individual different immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the influence of the used assay in the detection of IgG antibodies. This should be further analysed. The specificity of the examined assays was ≥ 97%. However, because of the low or unknown prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the examined assays in this study are currently primarily eligible for epidemiological investigations, as they have limited information in individual testing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antibody; Assay; Evaluation; IgG; PRNT; SARS-CoV-2","immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; neutralizing antibody; viral protein; virus antigen; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; antibody titer; Article; clinical article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; evaluation study; follow up; human; human cell; nonhuman; plaque reduction neutralization test; plasma; priority journal; serodiagnosis; serum; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus neutralization; Betacoronavirus; blood; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; high throughput screening; immunology; laboratory automation; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; serology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Automation, Laboratory; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests","32505777","J.

In this work we performed an independent evaluation of the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit Researh Use Only (Altona) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Methods: A comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed between RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 and the currently WHO recommended RT-PCR (WHO-PCR) workflow using a quantified clinical sample. Assessment of the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 assay was also performed using 83 primary clinical samples in comparison with the WHO-PCR. Results: The RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a slightly higher sensitivity than the WHO recommended assay with a limit of detection at 625 copies/mL instead of 1250 copies/mL for the WHO-PCR in our conditions. The overall percent agreement between RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 and WHO-PCR on 83 clinical samples was 97.6 % (81/83) with a sensitivity at 97.8 % (45/46) and specificity at 97.3 % (36/37). No cross reaction was encountered for the other human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, NL63, 229E). Conclusions: In this comparison of the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 assay with the reference WHO assay, we observed a slightly better sensitivity of the RealStar® assay. It provides a robust option for all molecular biology laboratories, with a strong real-life LoD and is compatible with various real-time PCR platforms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity","virus RNA; Article; comparative study; controlled study; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus NL63; Human coronavirus OC43; Human respiratory syncytial virus; limit of detection; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity analysis; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; limit of detection; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Limit of Detection; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity","32652476","J.

In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections.

Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms. Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Extra-respiratory manifestations; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; ribavirin; teicoplanin; tocilizumab; umifenovir; abdominal pain; acne; acute kidney failure; ageusia; anaphylaxis; anemia; anosmia; Article; asthenia; ataxia; blood clotting disorder; cardiomyopathy; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; diarrhea; drug fever; drug safety; dysgeusia; eye disease; gastrointestinal symptom; hair loss; headache; heart arrhythmia; heart injury; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; hyposmia; immune deficiency; kidney dysfunction; leukopenia; liver dysfunction; liver injury; lymphocytopenia; mouth ulcer; muscle atrophy; nausea; nausea and vomiting; neuromuscular disease; nonhuman; porphyria; priority journal; prognosis; pruritus; psoriasis; psychosis; QT prolongation; rash; retinopathy; rhinopharyngitis; risk factor; seizure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; skin manifestation; thorax pain; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; tinnitus; vertigo; viral conjunctivitis; virus shedding; virus transmission; vomiting","32450197","Int.

Design: Pilot cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patient(s): Thirty-four men were distributed as: 1) patients in convalescence (patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pharyngeal swab according to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] or antibodies); 2) negative control group (no antibodies); and 3) patients with an acute infection (detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab). Intervention: Semen and a blood sample were collected from each individual. Main Outcome Measure(s): Analysis of semen quality according to the World Health Organization standards. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the native semen sample and after density gradient preparation. Confirmation of immunoglobulin (Ig) A und IgG antibodies in the blood. Result(s): Eighteen semen samples from recovered men were obtained 8–54 days after absence of symptoms, 14 from control subjects, and 2 from patients with an active COVID-19 infection. No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen, including semen samples from two patients with an acute COVID-19 infection. Subjects with a moderate infection showed an impairment of sperm quality. Conclusion(s): A mild COVID-19 infection is not likely to affect testis and epididymis function, whereas semen parameters did seem impaired after a moderate infection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA could not be detected in semen of recovered and acute COVID-19–positive men.

However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell® POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). Conclusions: The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays. To achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on antibody detection, a dual challenge must be met: the immunodiagnostic window period must be shortened and an optimal specificity must be conserved. © 2020","COVID-19; ELISA; point of care tests; SARS-CoV-2 antibodies","immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; adult; aged; antibody detection; Article; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; male; nonhuman; point of care testing; sensitivity and specificity; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; very elderly","32504735","J.

The pandemic's initial challenges include broad diagnostic testing, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment. In early 2020, primer/probe sets distributed by the CDC utilized the same fluorophore for molecular detection - requiring multiple assays to be run in parallel - consuming valuable and limited resources. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs submitted to UW Virology for SARS-CoV-2 clinical testing were extracted, amplified by our laboratory developed test (LDT) - a CDC-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR reaction - and analyzed for agreement between the multiplexed assay. Laboratory- confirmed respiratory infection samples were included to evaluate assay cross-reaction specificity. Results: Triplexing correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 98.4% of confirmed positive or inconclusive patient samples by single-plex LDT (n = 183/186). All 170 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples tested by single-plex LDT were negative by triplexing. Other laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections did not amplify for SARS-CoV-2 in the triplex reaction. Conclusions: Multiplexing two virus-specific gene targets and an extraction control was found to be comparable to running parallel assays independently, while significantly improving assay throughput. © 2020","COVID-19; LDT; Multiplex; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Triplex","Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; female; human; human cell; multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; oligonucleotide probe; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; primer DNA; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; DNA Primers; Humans; Oligonucleotide Probes; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32535397","J.

Preventive measures and infection control are underway, and some areas show signs of convergence. Other viruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2 cause cold-like symptoms and spread in the winter. However, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses and other causative viruses have prevailed since implementing preventive measures is unclear. Objectives: We aim to investigate the incidence of causative viruses and pathogens in patients. Study design: We collected 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with cold-like symptoms in Japan. All samples were subjected to multiplex PCR with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2. Results: FilmArray Respiratory Panel analysis detected at least one virus in 32 of 191 patients with cold-like symptoms (21 %). Of these, we frequently identified human rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (5.8 %, n=11), human metapneumovirus (3.7 %, n=7), coronavirus 229E (2.1 %, n=4) and coronavirus OC43 (1.6 %, n=3); while no influenza viruses were detected. RT-PCR analysis detected SARS-CoV-2 (4.2 %, n=8) in patients who were not infected with the aforementioned respiratory viruses. Conclusions: Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses was not observed. Causative viruses remain prevalent after implementing preventive measures.

The sensitivities of the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical IgG assays in convalescent-phase serum samples collected more than 14 days post-symptom onset or post-initial positive reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) result were 92.9% (78/84), 88.1% (74/84), 97.6% (82/84), and 98.8% (83/84), respectively. Among unique convalescent patients, sensitivities of the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were 97.3% (36/37), 73% (27/37), 94.6% (35/37), and 97.3% (36/37), respectively. Overall assay specificity/positive predictive values based on a 5% prevalence rate were 99.6%/92.8%, 99.6%/90.6%, 98.0%/71.2%, and 99.6%/92.5%, respectively, for the Abbott, Epitope, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical IgG assays. In conclusion, we show high sensitivity in convalescent-phase sera and high specificity for the Abbott, Euroimmun, and Ortho-Clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. With the unprecedented influx of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, it remains imperative that laboratories thoroughly evaluate such assays for accuracy prior to implementation. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

Retrospective studies of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, report an incidence of 3%–7% progressing to ARF, a marker of poor prognosis. The cause of the renal failure in COVID-19 is unknown, but one hypothesized mechanism is direct renal infection by the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. Methods We performed an autopsy on a single patient who died of COVID-19 after open repair of an aortic dissection, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and oliguric renal failure. We used light and electron microscopy to examine renal tissue for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 within renal cells. Results Light microscopy of proximal tubules showed geographic isometric vacuolization, corresponding to a focus of tubules with abundant intracellular viral arrays. Individual viruses averaged 76 mm in diameter and had an envelope studded with crown-like, electron-dense spikes. Vacuoles contained double-membrane vesicles suggestive of partially assembled virus. Conclusions The presence of viral particles in the renal tubular epithelium that were morphologically identical to SARS-CoV-2, and with viral arrays and other features of virus assembly, provide evidence of a productive direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. This finding offers confirmatory evidence that direct renal infection occurs in the setting of AKI in COVID-19. However, the frequency and clinical significance of direct infection in COVID-19 is unclear. Tubular isometric vacuolization observed with light microscopy, which correlates with double-membrane vesicles containing vacuoles observed with electronic microscopy, may be a useful histologic marker for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney biopsy or autopsy specimens. © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology",,,"32371536","J.

While real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has performed as the main method for virus detection, other methods are becoming available, including transcription mediated amplification (TMA). The Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay utilizes TMA as a target amplification mechanism, and it has only recently received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Objectives: We sought to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay to RTPCR as a means of SARS-CoV-2 detection in a diagnostic setting. Study design: We performed a limit-of-detection study (LoD) to assess the analytical sensitivity of TMA and RT-PCR. This preceded a comparison of the methods using previously evaluated clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) using 116 human specimens tested by both methodologies. Specimens included sixty-one (61) specimens found reactive by real-time PCR, fifty-one (51) found non-reactive, and four (4) deemed inconclusive. Results: The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay showed a markedly higher analytical sensitivity than RT-PCR by LoD study. Evaluation of clinical specimens resulted in fewer inconclusive results by the SARS-CoV-2 assay, leading to potentially higher clinical sensitivity. Conclusions: Higher analytical sensitivity may explain TMA's ability to ascertain for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in human specimens deemed inconclusive by real-time PCR. TMA provides an effective, highly sensitive means of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aptima; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity; TMA; Transcription mediated amplification","genomic RNA; virus RNA; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; false positive result; human; intermethod comparison; limit of detection; major clinical study; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; transcription-mediated amplification; virus detection; virus genome; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32619959","J.

Design or methods: As of week 21, 2020, the complete set of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID and GenBank databases were used in this study. SARS-CoV-2 primer sequences from publicly available panels (WHO, CDC, NMDC, and HKU) and QIAstat-Dx were included in the alignment, and accumulated genetic variability affecting any oligonucleotide annealing was annotated. Results: A total of 11,627 (34.38%) genomes included single mutations affecting annealing of any PCR assay. Variations in 8,773 (25.94%) genomes were considered as high risk, whereas additional 2,854 (8.43%) genomes presented low frequent single mutations and were predicted to yield no impact on sensitivity. In case of the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 Panel, 99.11% of the genomes matched with a 100% coverage all oligonucleotides, and critical variations were tested in vitro corroborating no loss of sensitivity. Conclusions: This analysis stresses the importance of targeting more than one region in the viral genome for SARS-CoV-2 detection to mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity due to the unknown mutation rate during this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. © 2020 The Author(s)","Genomic variants; RT-PCR performance; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; gene mutation; genetic variability; genetic variation; in vitro study; mutation rate; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral genetics; virus genome; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; genetics; genomics; human; mutation; pandemic; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Humans; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factors","32535302","Int.

In this report we present the performance of the EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for semi-quantitative detection of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and plasma samples using recombinant S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen. Specimens from patients, with and without COVID-19 infection, were tested at the University of Chicago Clinical Microbiology and Immunology Laboratory. Of 86 samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative patients, including 28 samples positive for common human coronavirus strains, 76 tested negative and 10 tested positive for IgA (88.4% agreement, 95% CI: 79.9–93.6) while 84 tested negative and 2 tested positive for IgG (97.7% agreement, 95% CI: 91.9–99.6). Of 82 samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 14 tested negative and 68 tested positive for IgA (82.9% agreement, 95% CI: 73.4–89.5) while 27 tested negative and 55 tested positive for IgG (67.1% agreement, 95% CI: 56.3–76.3). Of samples collected ≥4 days after positive PCR, 38 of 42 (90.5% agreement, 95% CI: 77.9–96.2) were positive for IgA, and 42 of 42 (100% agreement, 95% CI: 91.6–100) were positive for IgG, respectively. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA Assay demonstrated good sensitivity for detection of IgA and excellent sensitivity for detection of IgG antibodies from samples collected ≥4 days, after COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR. This assay demonstrated good specificity for IgA and excellent specificity for IgG and demonstrated only borderline cross reaction in 2 of the 28 samples from patients with common human coronaviruses infection, types NL63 and OC43. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Serology","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; viral protein; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; antibody detection; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; major clinical study; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus strain; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Illinois; immunology; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; serology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Chicago; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests","32485620","J.

There was an urgent need of a high-throughput molecular test for screening the COVID-19 patients in the community. The Luminex NxTAG CoV extended panel is a high-throughput FDA emergency use-authorized molecular diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This system targets three genes (ORF1ab, N, and E genes) of SARS-CoV-2, the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV, and the ORF5 region of MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of this system with nasopharyngeal swab specimens of 214 suspected COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. The results were compared with our routine COVID-19 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocol with a LightMix SarbecoV E-gene kit and an in-house RdRp/Hel RT-PCR assay. The NxTAG CoV extended panel demonstrated 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. On low-viral load specimens, the sensitivity of the NxTAG panel could still maintain at 85.71%. Strong agreement was observed between the NxTAG panel and the routine COVID-19 RT-PCR protocol (kappa value 0.98). Overall, the E gene target of the NxTAG panel demonstrated the highest sensitivity among the three SARS-CoV-2 targets, while the N gene targets demonstrated the least. In conclusion, the NxTAG CoV extended panel is simple to use, and it has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens.

Methods: A reverse transcription recombinase–aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted within 15 minutes at 39°C with portable instruments after addition of extracted RNA. The clinical performance of RT-RAA assay was evaluated using 947 clinical samples from five institutions in four regions of China; approved commercial fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) kits were used for parallel detection. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-RAA were compared and analysed. Results: The RT-RAA test results of 926 samples were consistent with those of qRT-PCR (330 were positive, 596 negative); 21 results were inconsistent. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-RAA was 97.63% (330/338, 95% confidence interval (CI) 95.21 to 98.90) and 97.87% (596/609, 95% CI 96.28 to 98.81) respectively.

Air pollution has been warned of as a modifiable factor contributing to differential SARS-CoV-2 spread but the biological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are still unknown. Air quality and COVID-19 epidemiological data from 110 Italian provinces were studied by correlation analysis, to evaluate the association between particulate matter (PM)2.5 concentrations and incidence, mortality rate and case fatality risk of COVID-19 in the period 20 February–31 March 2020. Bioinformatic analysis of the DNA sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was performed to identify consensus motifs for transcription factors mediating cellular response to pollutant insult. Positive correlations between PM2.5 levels and the incidence (r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.0001), the mortality rate (r = 0.65, p &lt; 0.0001) and the case fatality rate (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.0001) of COVID-19 were found. The bioinformatic analysis of the ACE-2 gene identified nine putative consensus motifs for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Our results confirm the supposed link between air pollution and the rate and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the hypothesis that pollution-induced over-expression of ACE-2 on human airways may favor SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this study was to determine the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in specimen transport media under various storage conditions. Transport media tested included UTM, UTM-RT, ESwab, M4, and saline (0.9% NaCl). Specimen types tested included nasopharyngeal/ oropharyngeal swabs in the above-named transport media, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and sputum. A high-titer SARS-CoV-2 remnant patient specimen was spiked into pooled SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative specimen remnants for the various medium types. Aliquots of samples were stored at 18°C to 26°C, 2°C to 8°C, and 10°C to 30°C and then tested at time points up to 14 days. Specimens consistently yielded amplifiable RNA with mean cycle threshold differences of 3 over the various conditions assayed, thus supporting the use and transport of alternative collection media and specimen types under a variety of temperature storage conditions. © 2020 Rogers et al.

In this work, we performed the first evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel (QIAstat-SARS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This assay is the first rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay, including SARS-CoV-2 detection, and is fully compatible with a non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care (PoC) testing. This evaluation was performed using 69 primary clinical samples (66 nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], 1 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample [BAL], 1 tracheal aspirate sample, and 1 bronchial aspirate sample) comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection with the currently WHO-recommended reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (WHO-RT-PCR) workflow. Additionally, a comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed for QIAstat-SARS and WHO-RT-PCR using a quantified clinical sample. Compatibility of sample pretreatment for viral neutralization or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested. The QIAstat-Dx respiratory SARS-CoV-2 panel demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to that of the WHO-recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1,000 copies/ml. The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-RT-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity of 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29). No cross-reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel. The QIAstat-SARS rapid multiplex PCR panel provides a highly sensitive, robust, and accurate assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. This assay allows rapid decisions even in non-PCR-trained laboratory or point-of-care testing, allowing innovative organization. © 2020 Visseaux et al.

In this work, predictive factors for survival in cancer patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 infection were investigated. Methods: PRE-COVID-19 is a retrospective study of all 302 cancer patients presenting to this institute with a suspicion of COVID-19 from March 1st to April 25th 2020. Data were collected using a web-based tool within electronic patient record approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patient characteristics symptoms and survival were collected and compared in SARS-COV-2 real-time or reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)–positive and RT-PCR–negative patients. Results: Fifty-five of the 302 (18.2%) patients with suspected COVID-19 had detectable SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples. RT-PCR–positive patients were older, had more frequently haematological malignancies, respiratory symptoms and suspected COVID-19 pneumonia of computed tomography (CT) scan. However, respectively, 38% and 20% of SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR–negative patients presented similar respiratory symptoms and CT scan images. Thirty of the 302 (9.9%) patients died during the observation period, including 24 (80%) with advanced disease. At the median follow-up of 25 days after the first symptoms, the death rate in RT-PCR–positive and RT-PCR–negative patients were 21% and 10%, respectively. In both groups, independent risk factors for death were male gender, Karnofsky performance status <60, cancer in relapse and respiratory symptoms. Detection of SARS-COV-2 on RT-PCR was not associated with an increased death rate (p = 0.10). None of the treatment given in the previous month (including cytotoxics, PD1 Ab, anti-CD20, VEGFR2…) correlated with survival. The survival of RT-PCR–positive and –negative patients with respiratory symptoms and/or COVID-19 type pneumonia on CT scan was similar with a 18.4% and 19.7% death rate at day 25. Most (22/30, 73%) cancer patients dying during this period were RT-PCR negative. Conclusion: The 30-day death rate of cancer patients with or without documented SARS-COV-2 infection is poor, but the majority of deaths occur in RT-PCR–negative patients. © 2020 The Author(s)","Cancer patients; COVID-19; Risk factors; RT-PCR; SARS-COV-2; Survival","angiogenesis inhibitor; CD20 antigen; cytotoxic agent; everolimus; gns 561; mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; monoclonal antibody; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; quinoline derivative; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; virus RNA; adult; advanced cancer; anosmia; Article; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dying; dysgeusia; dyspnea; female; fever; follow up; gender; hematologic malignancy; human; Karnofsky Performance Status; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; nasopharynx; nonhuman; pneumonia; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; solid malignant neoplasm; symptomatology; virus detection; age; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; complication; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; mortality; neoplasm; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sex factor; survival analysis; time factor; tumor recurrence; virology; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Karnofsky Performance Status; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factors; RNA, Viral; Sex Factors; Survival Analysis; Time Factors","32540204","Eur.

It is all the more important to understand the characteristics of the virus and to utilize them diagnostically, therapeutically and epidemiologically. This article firstly elucidates the medical importance of coronaviruses in general. Then angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding site of SARS-CoV‑2 and the possible influence on the disease susceptibility are explained. The gold standard for detection of an active SARS-CoV‑2 infection is the direct detection of the pathogen with nucleic acid amplification techniques. At the onset of symptoms, a swab of the upper airway is especially suitable due to the high viral burden. At a later stage direct detection can be achieved in samples from the lower airway or a stool or anal swab. Antigen or antibody tests cannot replace the direct detection of the pathogen; however, the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies are of special interest for epidemiological questions (seroconversion time of sometimes several weeks). The plaque reduction neutralization test exclusively detects antibodies which neutralize viruses but the procedure is complicated. In addition, the importance of these antibodies with respect to immunity against a second infection is uncertain. Thanks to modern techniques thousands of SARS-CoV‑2 sequences are already available, which show a genomic variability. The D614G mutation in the S spikes seems to cause a higher infectiosity. Mutations can impair the diagnostics and treatment, which makes monitoring necessary. © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Betacoronavirus; Monitoring/mutations; Neutralization tests; Nucleic acid amplification techniques","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; immunoglobulin G; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; virus receptor; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; isolation and purification; nucleic acid amplification; pandemic; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Genome, Viral; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","32705298","Internist",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088507509

Nevertheless, the assessment of clinical performances of available tests is urgently required as their use has just been initiated for diagnose. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of three immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Two automated immunoassays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG/IgA assays) and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19) were tested. 293 specimens were analyzed from patients with a positive RT-PCR response, from patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but exhibiting a negative response to the RT-PCR detection test, and from control group specimens. Days since symptoms onset were collected from clinical information sheet associated with respiratory tract samples. Results: Overall sensitivity for IgG was equivalent (around 80 %) for CLIA, ELISA and LFIA. Sensitivity for IgG detection, >14 days after onset of symptoms, was 100.0 % for all assays. Overall specificity for IgG was greater for CLIA and LFIA (more than 98 %) compared to ELISA (95.8 %). Specificity was significantly different between IgA ELISA (78.9 %) and IgM LFIA (95.8 %) (p < 0.05). The best agreement was observed between CLIA and LFIA assays (97 %; k = 0.936). Conclusion: Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained >14 days after onset of symptoms for all immunoassays. Specificity was also excellent for IgG CLIA and IgG LFIA.

Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was determined for the RAD test using viral culture and RT-PCR as reference methods. The RAD test was further evaluated using respiratory samples collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results were compared with RT-PCR test. Results: The detection limits between RAD test, viral culture and RT-PCR varied hugely. RAD was 103 fold less sensitive than viral culture while RAD was 105 fold less sensitive than RT-PCR. The RAD test detected between 11.1 % and 45.7 % of RT-PCR-positive samples from COVID-19 patients.

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing are needed for detection of current or past infections. A wide range of commercial tests is available. However, most of them need to be validated. Study design: The aim was to compare a commercial IgG and IgA ELISA (Euroimmun) with three lateral flow immunoassays (LFI): Hangzhou Alltest Biotech, Wuhan UNscience Biotechnology and Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Specificity was calculated with 62 available serum samples from 2018/19. The study included 152 sera from patients of which 109 were RT-PCR positive. Sensitivities for ELISA anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were 81.5 % and 93.1 % and specificities 100 % and 80.6 %, respectively. LFI showed variable performances, overall results being better for Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. Conclusions: Commercial serological tests are useful for detection of antibodies in patients with COVID-19. ELISA presented better results than LFI. The results allowed to incorporate the most sensitive LFI to the daily workflow, combining with ELISA. Careful validation is encouraged before clinical laboratories start using these tests. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antibody detection; COVID-19; Diagnosis; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity; Specificity","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; adolescent; adult; aged; antibody detection; Article; child; comparative study; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; male; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunoassay; immunology; laboratory technique; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; serology; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Child; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Young Adult","32659710","J.

This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation. A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided ""real world""analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit. Comparison between the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and specificities regarding the determination of the IgG. This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","CLIA; COVID-19; ELISA; SARS-CoV-2","immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; virus antibody; antibody detection; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; limit of blank; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; major clinical study; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunoassay; immunology; laboratory technique; luminescence; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoassay; Limit of Detection; Luminescence; Luminescent Measurements; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies","32447328","Clin.

In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases. Method: We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families. Result: Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed. Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations. Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms. The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days. A prolonged period of virus shedding (>30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters. While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly. We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus disease-19; COVID-19; Epidemiological features; Family clusters; SARS-CoV-2","adult; aged; Article; child; childhood; China; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; disease transmission; family; family cluster; family size; female; human; incubation time; infant; infection rate; latent period; male; middle aged; preschool child; school child; upper respiratory tract; very elderly; virus shedding; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Beijing; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32335171","J.

Comparative data is needed as a basis for the production of convalescent plasma and potential interpretations COVID-19 immunity. Sera of 100 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors were collected and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were characterized using three different IgG-ELISAs (EUROIMMUN IgG and NCP-IgG ELISA, Wantai ELISA), two CLIA (Elecsys, LIAISON) and two lateral flow tests (MEDsan IgM/IgG-Rapid-Test, Wantai Rapid Test) and subsequently correlated to neutralization titers. The Wantai ELISA and the Elecsys provide the highest sensitivities in this sample (98 and 95 percent respectively). Titers with the best overall quantitative correlation to the NT titer were obtained with the Euroimmun IgG ELISA assay (Rho=0.759) and the Wantai ELISA assay (Rho=0.729). An infection without fever and negative or weakly positive reactions in the Wantai Rapid test were negative predictive factors for NT titers >1:200 (negative predictive value of 92 % and 92 % respectively, combination of both 100 %). The Wantai ELISA titer could be a suitable substitute for NT.

Objectives: This study compared the results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using different simple nucleic acid extraction methods on nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens. Study design: Fifty nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved. Three different methods of nucleic acid extraction were compared. The first method involves incubating the specimen with proteinase K, and then heat treatment at 98 °C for 5 min (PKH); the second method involves heat treatment at 98 °C for 5 min without proteinase K pre-incubation (heat only); the third method involves no pre-processing steps (direct). The products from all 3 methods were tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Results: PKH had significantly higher positive rate in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (80 %) than those of heat only (58 %; P = 0.001) or direct (56 %; P = 0.002). The median Ct value was significantly earlier for PKH (median Ct: 37.0, IQR 31.7–40) than that of heat only (median Ct: 40, IQR 36.2–41; P < 0.0001) and direct (median Ct, 37.5; IQR 33.9–41.0; P = 0.0049). Subgroup analysis showed that PKH had higher detection rate, lower limit of detection and earlier Ct values than the other two groups for both NPS and saliva specimens. Conclusions: PKH pre-processing resulted in the highest detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and represents an alternative method for nucleic acid extraction when commercial extraction kits are not available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Detection; Nucleic acid extraction; Proteinase K; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","nucleic acid; proteinase K; virus RNA; Article; DNA extraction; heat treatment; human; limit of detection; nonhuman; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; saliva; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; genetics; heat; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; nasopharynx; pandemic; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; saliva; specimen handling; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Hot Temperature; Humans; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Saliva; Specimen Handling","32629187","J.

Serologic tests could be complementary to PCR in these situations. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of one serologic rapid test in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We evaluated a lateral flow immunoassay (AllTest COVID-19 IgG/IgM) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. We validated the serologic test using serum samples from 100 negative patients (group 1) and 90 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR (group 2). Then, we prospectively evaluated the test in 61 patients with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology that were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (group 3). Results: All 100 patients from group 1 were negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100 %). Regarding group 2 (PCR-positive), the median time from their symptom onset until testing was 17 days. For these 90 group-2 patients, the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 58 (overall sensitivity = 64.4 %), and in patients tested 14 days or more after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 88.0 %. Regarding the 61 group-3 patients, median time after symptom onset was also 17 days, and the test was positive in 54 (88.5 % positivity). Conclusions: Our study shows that Alltest lateral flow immunoassay is reliable as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms and in patients with pneumonia and negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alltest; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Lateral flow immunoassay; SARS-CoV-2; Serologic rapid test","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; adult; aged; antibody detection; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; prospective study; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; immunoassay; immunology; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; time factor; virus pneumonia; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Time Factors","32504945","J.

The swift advance of the crisis in the United States has led to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) facilitating the availability of molecular diagnostic assays without the more rigorous examination to which tests are normally subjected prior to FDA approval. Our laboratory currently uses two real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. The two platforms demonstrate comparable performances; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 h and 45 min, respectively. In search for a platform with a shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID Now COVID-19 assay, which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 min. We present here the results of comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media and comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media for Cepheid and dry nasal swabs for Abbott ID Now.

The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use. The aim of this study was to assess the test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test. The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT), targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI, 53.3 to 80.5%), and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test and showed low viral load burden, with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI, 94.2 to 100%). Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false-negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pretest probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- qPCR) is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment and skilled staff limit the use of these time-consuming molecular techniques. Recently, several easy to perform rapid antigen detection tests were developed and recommended in some countries as the first line of diagnostic. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of the Coris COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip test, a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, in comparison to RT-qPCR. Results: 148 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 106 positive RT-qPCR samples, 32 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 30.2%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. Conclusions: Higher viral loads are associated with better antigen detection rates. Unfortunately, the overall poor sensitivity of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020","COVID-19; Rapid antigen detection test; SARS-CoV-2","adolescent; adult; aged; antigen detection; Article; child; comparative effectiveness; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; infant; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nose smear; null result; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistically significant result; ultracentrifugation; virus load; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunoassay; immunology; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; middle aged; nasopharynx; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; virus antigen; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Antigens, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","32485618","J.

With the need to increase the test capacities in Austria, nation-wide numerous laboratories rapidly implemented assays for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time RT-PCR assays. The objective of this study was to monitor reliability of the laboratory results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme. Methods: For this, the Center for Virology, Medical University of Vienna was tasked by the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection to perform the first Austrian EQA on SARS-CoV-2 which was organised in cooperation with the Austrian Association for Quality Assurance and Standardization of Medical and Diagnostic Tests (ÖQUASTA). Data were analysed on the basis of qualitative outcome of testing in relation to the nucleic acid (NA) extraction and detection methods used. Results and Conclusion: A total of 52 laboratories participated, contributing results from 67 test panels comprising 42 distinct combinations of NA extraction and PCR reagents. By testing 3 positive (CT values: S1, 28.4; S2, 33.6; S3, 38.5) and 1 negative sample, no false-positive results were obtained by any of the laboratories. Otherwise, 40/67 tests (60 %) detected all positive samples correctly as positive, but 25/67 tests (37 %) did not detect the weakest positive sample (S3), and 3 % reported S2 and S3 as false-negative. Improvement in test sensitivity by focusing on NA extraction and/or PCR-based detection is recommended. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19 pandemic; Evaluation; External quality assessment; Molecular test; SARS-CoV-2; Standardisation","virus RNA; Article; Austria; coronavirus disease 2019; false negative result; false positive result; gene sequence; human; laboratory; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; standardization; virus detection; virus genome; virus load; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic error; good laboratory practice; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; organization and management; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; Austria; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnostic Errors; Humans; Laboratory Proficiency Testing; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity","32659712","J.

Methods: We evaluated three methods based on direct nasopharyngeal swab viral transmission medium (VTM) heating before the RT-qPCR: a) direct without additives; b) in a formamide-EDTA (FAE) buffer, c) in a RNAsnapTM buffer. Results: Although with a delay in cycle threshold compared to the gold-standard, we found consistent results in nasopharyngeal swab samples that were subject to a direct 70°C incubation for 10 min.

Pa-COVID-19 aims to provide comprehensive data on clinical course, pathophysiology, immunology and outcome of COVID-19, to identify prognostic biomarkers, clinical scores, and therapeutic targets for improved clinical management and preventive interventions. Methods: Pa-COVID-19 is a prospective observational cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We collect data on epidemiology, demography, medical history, symptoms, clinical course, and pathogen testing and treatment. Systematic, serial blood sampling will allow deep molecular and immunological phenotyping, transcriptomic profiling, and comprehensive biobanking. Longitudinal data and sample collection during hospitalization will be supplemented by long-term follow-up. Results: Outcome measures include the WHO clinical ordinal scale on day 15 and clinical, functional, and health-related quality-of-life assessments at discharge and during follow-up. We developed a scalable dataset to (i) suit national standards of care, (ii) facilitate comprehensive data collection in medical care facilities with varying resources, and (iii) allow for rapid implementation of interventional trials based on the standardized study design and data collection. We propose this scalable protocol as blueprint for harmonized data collection and deep phenotyping in COVID-19 in Germany. Conclusion: We established a basic platform for harmonized, scalable data collection, pathophysiological analysis, and deep phenotyping of COVID-19, which enables rapid generation of evidence for improved medical care and identification of candidate therapeutic and preventive strategies. The electronic database accredited for interventional trials allows fast trial implementation for candidate therapeutic agents.

From 10 March to 1 May 2020, NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed for 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had initial negative and 802 had initial positive results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to have severe disease and low viral loads. The negative predictive value of the first-day result among repeat-tested patients was 81.3% The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays was estimated between 58% and 96%, depending on the unknown number of false-negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to negative was unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20 to 30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Conversion from first-day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. Sixty patients fluctuated between positive and negative results over several weeks, suggesting that caution is needed when single-test results are acted upon. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely, 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same day or next 2 days after a negative test for patients with high suspicion for COVID-19. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

Therefore, we conducted environmental surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 contamination in 2 different healthcare settings. Methods: Viral contamination was investigated on the environment of 2 hospitals that had admitted 13 COVID-19 patients. In hospital A, 5 patients with pneumonia occupied negative pressure rooms. In hospital B, 8 asymptomatic patients shared 2 common 4-bed rooms. Most rooms were poorly cleaned or disinfected. Environmental swab were collected from inside and outside the rooms and were tested using real-time RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Results: In hospital A, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10 of 57 (17.5%) samples from inside the rooms including the Ambu bag and infusion pump. Two samples obtained at more than 2 m from the patients showed positive results. In hospital B, 3 of 22 (13.6%) samples from inside the rooms were positive. Areas outside the rooms, such as the anteroom, corridor, and nursing station, were all negative in both hospitals. Conclusions: Hospital surfaces surrounding patients were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2.

The proposed sensitivity is not higher than 60 %, but its high specificity allows both quick decisions for the management of patients and confirmation by molecular diagnosis for only negative tests. However, from the first tests performed, we suspected that the sensitivity observed with routine use was much lower than that announced by the manufacturer. Materials and methods: Over a period of one month, we compared the negative results obtained with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip kit with those obtained from qRT-PCR performed in a laboratory qualified for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. All samples tested were naso-pharyngeal smears from UTM-RT medium. Results: Of 774 patients tested, 714 negative samples were sent for confirmation, and 159 were found to be positive by qRT-PCR. The median positive percentage agreement was 23.9 % (95 % CI: 14.2 %–38.2 %). The Cohen's kappa score was 0.35. Conclusion: Using this immunochromatographic assay as a triage test did not significantly reduce the number of samples outsourced for COVID-19 confirmation by qRT-PCR. In addition, even if the turn-around time is short, the assay is completely manual, which is not suitable for large volumes of routine samples. The sensitivity of this rapid test is poor, and improvements are needed to enhance its performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antigen testing; COVID-19; Point-of-care; qRT-PCR; Rapid diagnosis; SARS-CoV-2","antigen detection; antigenicity; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; human; laboratory test; major clinical study; molecular diagnosis; null result; predictive value; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","32504944","J.

Rapid first-line testing protocols are needed for outbreak control and surveillance. METHODS: We used computational and manual designs to generate a suitable set of reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) primer and exonuclease probe, internally quenched (exo-IQ), sequences targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. RT-RPA sensitivity was determined by amplification of in vitro transcribed RNA standards. Assay selectivity was demonstrated with a selectivity panel of 32 nucleic acid samples derived from common respiratory viruses. To validate the assay against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total viral RNA derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 positive and 11 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were screened. All results were compared to established RT-qPCR assays. RESULTS: The 95% detection probability of the RT-RPA assay was determined to be 7.74 (95% CI: 2.87-27.39) RNA copies per reaction. The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance. The developed RT-RPA assay produced 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to RT-qPCR (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: With a run time of 15 to 20 minutes and first results being available in under 7 minutes for high RNA concentrations, the reported assay constitutes one of the fastest nucleic acid based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to date and may provide a simple-to-use alternative to RT-qPCR for first-line screening at the point of need. © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

Rapid detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suspected cases is crucial to control the spread of infection. We aimed to evaluate the time length of negativization from the onset of symptoms in healthcare workers (HCWs) with COVID-19, and to evaluate significant variations in cycle threshold (CT) values and gene positivity (E, RdRP, and N genes) among positive individuals who returned to work. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 182 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in Milan, from 16 March to 30 April 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Results: Asymptomatic HCWs were 17.6% (32/182), and 58 healed at 30 April 2020. The median time length of negativization was 4 weeks (35% of symptomatic versus 40% of asymptomatic HCWs). Four HCWs, healed at 30 April, turned positive within three weeks during controls set up in the work unit. Three-gene positivity had the greatest variability, and increasing CT values from single-to three-gene positivity among all age groups were observed. Conclusions: Self-isolation longer than two weeks and prolonged follow-up periods for the staff returning to work after COVID-19 could be the most suitable choices to counter the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Further studies are needed to investigate infectiousness profiles among positive individuals. © 2020 by the authors.

The analytical and clinical performances of LightMix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene kit, a widely used commercial assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection, have not been well studied. Objective: To evaluate the performance characteristics of the LightMix® E-gene kit in comparison with well-validated in-house developed COVID-19 RT-PCR assays. Study design: Serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 culture isolate extracts were used for analytical sensitivity evaluation. A total of 289 clinical specimens from 186 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 8 proficiency testing (PT) samples were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the LightMix® E-gene kit against in-house developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N RT-PCR assays. Results: The LightMix® E-gene kit had a limit of detection of 1.8 × 10−1 TCID50/mL, which was one log10 lower than those of the two in-house RT-PCR assays. The LightMix® E-gene kit (149/289 [51.6%]) had similar sensitivity as the in-house assays (144/289 [49.8%] for RdRp/Hel and 146/289 [50.5%] for N). All three assays gave correct results for all the PT samples. Cycle threshold (Cp) values of the LightMix® E-gene kit and in-house assays showed excellent correlation. Reproducibility of the Cp values was satisfactory with intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation values &lt;5%. Importantly, the LightMix® E-gene kit, when used as a stand-alone assay, was equally sensitive as testing algorithms using multiple COVID-19 RT-PCR assays. Conclusions: The LightMix® E-gene kit is a rapid and sensitive assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. It has fewer verification requirements compared to laboratory-developed tests. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Diagnostic; Evaluation; LightMix E-gene; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","helicase; nucleocapsid protein; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus RNA; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; dilution; female; human; infection control; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; limit of detection; major clinical study; male; patient care; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; study design; Vero C1008 cell line; virus culture; virus detection; virus load; virus nucleocapsid; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; middle aged; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; standard; time factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Limit of Detection; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time Factors; Young Adult","32516739","J.

The origin of SARS-CoV-2 infection was first reported in people exposed to a seafood market in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. It has been suggested that the infection is likely to be of zoonotic origin and transmitted to humans through a not-yet-known intermediary. As of 22 May 2020, the World Health Organization reported that there were approximately 4,995,996 confirmed cases and 327,821 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via inhalation or direct contact with droplets from infected people. It has an incubation period ranging from 2 to ≥14 days. The rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2 is greater than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory coronavirus. The symptoms are similar to influenza (i.e. breathlessness, sore throat and fatigue) and infected cases are isolated and treated. Infection is mild in most cases, but in elderly (>50 years) patients and those with cardiac and respiratory disorders, it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. People with strong immunity or those who have developed herd immunity are asymptomatic. The fatality rate ranges from 3% to 4%. Recommended methods for diagnosis of COVID-19 are molecular tests (e.g. polymerase chain reaction) on respiratory secretions, chest scan and common laboratory diagnosis. Currently, treatment is essentially supportive, and the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established as a vaccine is not yet available. This review will focus on epidemiology, symptoms, transmission, pathogenesis, ongoing available treatments and future perspectives of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral agents; Biosensor; Chloroquine; Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Severe acute respiratory syndrome","alpha interferon; arbidol; baricitinib; chloroquine; Human immunodeficiency virus proteinase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 6; ivermectin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrophage inflammatory protein; nucleoside analog; ribavirin; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; tumor necrosis factor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; China; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; drug mechanism; dyspnea; fatigue; host cell; human; incubation time; infection control; mortality rate; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; receptor binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; vaccination; virus entry","32534188","Int.

There are growing concerns on the impact of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Several papers reporting recommendations and guidelines are published. But few data on cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are available. Methods: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients affected by gynecological cancer who developed COVID-19. All patients were treated in an academic setting (in Milan, Lombardy, Italy) between February and March 2020. Results: Overall, 355 patients had active treatment during the study period due to newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecological disease. Among those, 19 (5.3%) patients affected developed COVID-19. All patients were asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 detection. Six patients were diagnosed before starting planned treatments; while the remaining 13 were diagnosed for COVID-19 after their started their treatments. Considering the first group of six patients, one patient died due to COVID-19 3 days after the diagnosis; while the other patients recovered from COVID-19 after a median of three weeks. The latter group of 13 patients (treatments started) included five patients who underwent surgery and eight patients who underwent chemotherapy. Focusing on five patients who were diagnosed after surgery, we observed that two patients died during postoperative course, while in other two cases prolonged hospitalization was needed. One patient had no issues. Chemotherapy was delayed for the remaining patents without sequelae. Conclusions: Our report highlights that COVID-19 impacts the quality of treatments for cancer patients. Mortality rate is high, especially after surgery. More important, patients under active treatment for cancer are at high risk of developing severe evolution of COVID-19. Prioritizing patients journey during COVID-19 is of paramount importance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; COVID-19; Oncology; SARS-CoV-2","bevacizumab; adult; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; carcinosarcoma; cardiovascular disease; chemotherapy; chronic kidney failure; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytoreductive surgery; dysphagia; dyspnea; endometrium cancer; female; female genital tract cancer; fever; high resolution computer tomography; hospitalization; human; hypothyroidism; interstitial pneumonia; Italy; laparoscopy; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; middle aged; mortality rate; nonhuman; ovary cancer; postoperative period; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; therapy delay; uterine cervix cancer; very elderly; virus pneumonia","32534808","Gynecol.

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of ~20μM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2 to 3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3 2B4 [referred to here as ""Calu-3""]) were treated. Time-of-addition and plaque reduction assays performed on Vero E6 cells showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing binding or entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.

Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study that used a random sample of non-hospitalized patients from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon (58 RT-PCR-positive cases and 52 RT-PCR-negative cases). Information regarding symptoms was collected and all patients were simultaneously tested using two RDTs (Combined - cRDT and Differentiated - dRDT). The results of both tests were evaluated using the chi-square test and, for degree of agreement, the kappa coefficient. Results: About 52% of the participants were women (mean age: 48.2 ± 11.0 years). A total of 58.2% were positive for d-RDT and 41.2% were positive for c-RDT. In the subjects who were RT-PCR-positive, d-RDT was positive in 72.4% and c-RDT in 55.2%; in those who were RT-PCR-negative, the percentages were 42.3% and 26.9%, respectively. The kappa coefficient observed between the two RDTs was 0.644, and was higher in patients without a fever or anosmia (0.725) and lower in those with a fever or anosmia (0.524). Conclusions: There is good agreement between the tests used in this study.

There is a need to assess their test performance relative to one another. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of a high complexity laboratory-developed rRT-PCR EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene with other tests: the Atila isothermal amplification assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the Altona E and spike (S) multiplex, real-time RT-PCR, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 rRT-PCRs. Study Design: A diagnostic comparison study was performed by testing nasopharyngeal samples from persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Assay performance was assessed by percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: Positive percent agreement with the SHC EUA reference assay was 82.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) for Atila, 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) for the Altona E and S targets, and 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) and 90.0 % (95 % CI 73.6 to 97.3), for the CDC N1 and N2 targets, respectively. All assays demonstrated 100 % negative percent agreement. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, indicating excellent agreement.

Initially, mostly laboratory developed molecular tests were available but shortly thereafter different commercial assays started to appear and are still increasing in number. Although independent performance evaluations are ongoing, available data is still scarce. Here we provide a direct comparison of key performance characteristics of 13 commercial RT-PCR assays. Thirteen RT-PCR assays were selected based on the criteria that they can be used following generic RNA extraction protocols, on common PCR platforms and availability. Using a 10-fold and 2-fold dilution series of a quantified SARS-CoV-2 cell-cultured virus stock, performance was assessed compared to our in house validated assay. Specificity was tested by using RNA extracted from cultured common human coronaviruses. All RT-PCR kits included in this study exhibited PCR efficiencies > 90%, except for the Sentinel Diagnostics B E-gene RUO assay (80%). Analytical sensitivity varied between 3.3 RNA copies to 330 RNA copies. Only one assay cross reacted with another human coronavirus (MERS). This study provides a technical baseline of 13 different commercial PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that can be used by laboratories interested in purchasing any of these for further full clinical validation. © 2020","Realtime reverse transcription PCR; SARS-CoV-2","article; diagnostic test accuracy study; dilution; human; human cell; nonhuman; purchasing; quantitative analysis; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; cross reaction; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32570045","J.

The optimal dosing of HCQ is unknown. Our goal was to integrate historic and emerging pharmacological and toxicity data to understand safe and efficacious HCQ dosing strategies for COVID-19 treatment. The data sources included were (i) longitudinal clinical, pharmacokinetic (PK), and virologic data from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who received HCQ with or without azithromycin (n = 116), (ii) in vitro viral replication data and SARS-CoV-2 viral load inhibition by HCQ, (iii) a population PK model of HCQ, and (iv) a model relating chloroquine PKs to corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. A mechanistic PK/virologic/QTc model for HCQ was developed and externally validated to predict SARS-CoV-2 rate of viral decline and QTc prolongation. SARS-CoV-2 viral decline was associated with HCQ PKs (P &lt; 0.001). The extrapolated patient half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was 4.7 µM, comparable to the reported in vitro EC50s. HCQ doses &gt; 400 mg b.i.d. for ≥5 days were predicted to rapidly decrease viral loads, reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shorten treatment courses, compared with lower dose (≤ 400 mg daily) regimens. However, HCQ doses &gt; 600 mg b.i.d. were also predicted to prolong QTc intervals. This prolongation may have clinical implications warranting further safety assessment. Due to COVID-19's variable natural history, lower dose HCQ regimens may be indistinguishable from controls. Evaluation of higher HCQ doses is needed to ensure adequate safety and efficacy. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: Urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, who are familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Results: Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations. Conclusion: As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients.

This epidemiological finding raises the question of whether physiological mechanisms underlying the acclimatization to high altitude identifies therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome pivotal to the reduction of global mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article compares the symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) with those of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores overlapping patho-physiological mechanisms of the respiratory system including impaired oxygen transport, pulmonary gas exchange and brainstem circuits controlling respiration. In this context, we also discuss the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on oxygen sensing in the carotid body. Finally, since erythropoietin (EPO) is an effective prophylactic treatment for AMS, this article reviews the potential benefits of implementing FDA-approved erythropoietin-based (EPO) drug therapies to counteract a variety of acute respiratory and non-respiratory (e.g. excessive inflammation of vascular beds) symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acute respiratory distress; High-altitude hypoxia; Hypoxic acclimatization; Respiratory system; Silent hypoxemia","erythropoietin; erythropoietin; acclimatization; adjuvant therapy; altitude; altitude disease; Article; brain stem; carotid body; coronavirus disease 2019; hypoxemia; hypoxic lung vasoconstriction; lung gas exchange; neuroprotection; oxygen consumption; oxygen sensing; oxygen transport; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; priority journal; respiration control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; altitude disease; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; human; hypoxia; immunology; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; virus pneumonia; Acclimatization; Altitude Sickness; Coronavirus Infections; Erythropoietin; Humans; Hypoxia; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32522574","Respir.

We compared the CT features of common cases and severe cases, symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients, and febrile and afebrile patients. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical and thoracic CT features of 120 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to a tertiary university hospital between January 10 and February 10, 2020, in Wuhan city, China. Results: On admission, the patients generally complained of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue, with diarrhea often present in severe cases. Severe patients were 20 years older on average and had comorbidities and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. There were no differences in the CT findings between asymptomatic and symptomatic common type patients or between afebrile and febrile patients, defined according to Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. Conclusions: The clinical and CT features at admission may enable clinicians to promptly evaluate the prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinicians should be aware that clinically silent cases may present with CT features similar to those of symptomatic common patients. Key Points: • The clinical features and predominant patterns of abnormalities on CT for asymptomatic, typic common, and severe cases were summarized. These findings may help clinicians to identify severe patients quickly at admission. • Clinicians should be cautious that CT findings of afebrile/asymptomatic patients are not better than the findings of other types of patients. These patients should also be quarantined. • The use of chest CT as the main screening method in epidemic areas is recommended. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Chest; Fever; SARS-CoV-2; Tomography","lactate dehydrogenase; adult; Article; clinical feature; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; disease association; disease severity; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; human; image reconstruction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myalgia; observational study; practice guideline; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; aged; Betacoronavirus; China; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; pandemic; tertiary care center; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Diarrhea; Female; Fever; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Tertiary Care Centers; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32279115","Eur.

To date, documentation of the histopathological features in fatal cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been scarce due to sparse autopsy performance and incomplete organ sampling. We aimed to provide a clinicopathological report of severe COVID-19 cases by documenting histopathological changes and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism. Methods: In this case series, patients with a positive antemortem or post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 result were considered eligible for enrolment. Post-mortem examinations were done on 14 people who died with COVID-19 at the King County Medical Examiner's Office (Seattle, WA, USA) and Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office (Everett, WA, USA) in negative-pressure isolation suites during February and March, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination was done by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and quantitative RT-PCR. Findings: The median age of our cohort was 73·5 years (range 42–84; IQR 67·5–77·25). All patients had clinically significant comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute or organising phases, with five patients showing focal pulmonary microthrombi. Coronavirus-like particles were detected in the respiratory system, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Lymphocytic myocarditis was observed in one patient with viral RNA detected in the tissue. Interpretation: The primary pathology observed in our cohort was diffuse alveolar damage, with virus located in the pneumocytes and tracheal epithelium. Microthrombi, where observed, were scarce and endotheliitis was not identified. Although other non-pulmonary organs showed susceptibility to infection, their contribution to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further examination.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment. Method: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, France. We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions. Results: Patients with TCZ (n = 20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P = 0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13 L/min vs 6 L/min, P &lt; 0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P = 0.037 and higher CRP level: 158 mg/L vs 105 mg/L, P = 0.017) than patients without TCZ (n = 25). However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, P = 0.002). Conclusion: Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Intensive care unit; Mortality; SARS-CoV-2; Tocilizumab","C reactive protein; tocilizumab; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; adult; aged; Article; case control study; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease severity; female; France; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; lymphocytopenia; male; mortality; oxygen therapy; protein blood level; retrospective study; treatment outcome; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; critical illness; drug effect; hospital admission; immunology; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; pathology; severity of illness index; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Female; France; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Pandemics; Patient Admission; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","32387320","Med.

This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P < .05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and intensive care unit, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P = .238). The top 5 sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%). Conclusions: Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission.

A test-based strategy that requires negative respiratory RT-PCR tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms. Alternatively, due to the limited availability of testing, many sites employ a symptom-based strategy that recommends excluding HCW from the workforce and keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period of time has elapsed from symptom recovery. The underlying assumption of the symptom-based strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative RT-PCR testing, which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious virus. Objectives: To better understand the appropriate length of symptom based return to work and contact precaution strategies. Study Design: We performed an observational analysis of 150 patients and HCW that transitioned from RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive to negative over the course of 2 months at a US academic medical center. Results: We found that the average time to transition from RT-PCR positive to negative was 24 days after symptom onset and 10 % remained positive even 33 days after symptom onset. No difference was seen in HCW and patients. Conclusions: These findings suggest until definitive evidence of the length of infective viral shedding is obtained that the fixed length of time before returning to work or ceasing contract precautions be revised to over one-month. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; RT-PCR; SARS−COV-2","virus RNA; virus RNA; adult; aged; Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; emergency; female; fever; follow up; health care personnel; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; persistent virus infection; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; return to work; rhinorrhea; RNA analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus detection; virus shedding; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; middle aged; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; time factor; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; virus shedding; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Time Factors; Virus Shedding","32505778","J.

All but one of the newly-characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1, the most frequently identified in European countries, including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. © 2020 by the authors.

Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies. Methods: We conducted a statewide seroprevalence study in a 15,101 patron convenience sample at 99 grocery stores in 26 counties throughout NYS. SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was estimated from antibody reactivity by first poststratification weighting and then adjusting by antibody test characteristics. The percent diagnosed was estimated by dividing the number of diagnoses by the number of estimated infection-experienced adults. Results: Based on 1887 of 15,101 (12.5%) reactive results, estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.3%–14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800–2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5%–24.0%) and higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%) than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, P <.0001). An estimated 8.9% (95% CI: 8.4%–9.3%) of infections in NYS were diagnosed, with diagnosis highest among adults aged 55 years or older (11.3%, 95% CI: 10.4%–12.2%). Conclusions: From the largest U.S. serosurvey to date, we estimated >2 million adult New York residents were infected through late March, with substantial disparities, although cumulative incidence remained less than herd immunity thresholds.

A global pandemic followed. The infection, called novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Common symptoms of COVID-19 illness included fever, cough, and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography. Nucleic acid testing, in the form of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is essential for diagnosing COVID-19 from respiratory samples from infected patients. Still, many questions remain surrounding the optimization of pre-analytical factors, such as specimen selection, collection, and transport.

However, over the past weeks, an increase in the number of children presenting to hospitals in the greater Paris region with a phenotype resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) has led to an alert by the French national health authorities. Methods Multicentre compilation of patients with KD in Paris region since April 2020, associated with the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ( € Kawa-COVID-19'). A historical cohort of € classical' KD served as a comparator. Results Sixteen patients were included (sex ratio=1, median age 10 years IQR (4·7 to 12.5)). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 12 cases (69%), while a further three cases had documented recent contact with a quantitative PCR-positive individual (19%). Cardiac involvement included myocarditis in 44% (n=7). Factors prognostic for the development of severe disease (ie, requiring intensive care, n=7) were age over 5 years and ferritinaemia >1400 μg/L. Only five patients (31%) were successfully treated with a single intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusion, while 10 patients (62%) required a second line of treatment. The Kawa-COVID-19 cohort differed from a comparator group of € classical' KD by older age at onset 10 vs 2 years (p<0.0001), lower platelet count (188 vs 383 G/L (p<0.0001)), a higher rate of myocarditis 7/16 vs 3/220 (p=0.0001) and resistance to first IVIg treatment 10/16 vs 45/220 (p=0.004). Conclusion Kawa-COVID-19 likely represents a new systemic inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Further prospective international studies are necessary to confirm these findings and better understand the pathophysiology of Kawa-COVID-19.

Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations. Methods and results: This article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland. An in-corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety. The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus). Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively). All relevant histological slides are linked as open-source scans in supplementary files. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID-19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID-19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients. © 2020 The Authors.

The spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions may implicate direct viral invasion, para-infectious complications, neurological manifestations of systemic diseases, or co-incident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed. Methods: The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach. Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent. Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent. Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources. A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages <18 years. Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee. Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate. The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period. Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. Results: In a one-month period (3/27/20–4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites. Conclusions: This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic. The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world—an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Neurological manifestations; Neurological symptoms; SARS-CoV-2",,"32445105","Neurocrit.

Public health measures implemented to control the outbreak caused socio-economic havoc in many countries. The pandemic highlighted the quality of health care systems, responses of policymakers in harmony with the population, and socio-economic resilience factors. We suggest that different national strategies had an impact on mortality and case count. (2) Methods: We collected fatality data for 17 countries until 2 June 2020 from public data and associated these with implemented containment measures. (3) Results: The outcomes present the effectiveness of control mechanisms in mitigating the virus for selected countries and the UAE as a special case. Pre-existing conditions defined the needed public health strategies and fatality numbers. Other pre-existing conditions, such as temperature, humidity, median age, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations played minor roles and may have had no direct impact on fatality rates. (4) Conclusions: Prevention, fast containment, adequate public health strategies, and importance of indoor environments were determining factors in mitigating the pandemic.

Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol; COVID-19; HVAC; SARS-Cov-2; Ventilation","air and air related phenomena; air circulation; air conditioning; air inflow; air sampling; air temperature; airborne transmission route; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cruise ship; epidemic; equipment and supplies utilization; exposure; health care facility; heating; human; humidity; hypothesis; lung ventilation; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ship; sneezing; virus detection; virus load; virus shedding; virus transmission; virus viability; adverse event; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; biological model; Coronavirus infection; cross infection; device failure; devices; equipment design; fomite; indoor air pollution; isolation and purification; legionnaire disease; medical device contamination; microbiology; microclimate; pandemic; procedures; sanitation; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; virology; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Air Conditioning; Air Microbiology; Air Pollution, Indoor; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Environment, Controlled; Equipment Contamination; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure; Fomites; Heating; Humans; Legionnaires' Disease; Models, Biological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sanitary Engineering; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Sewage; Ventilation","32361528","Med.

The world we knew until now has been transformed and nowadays we live in a completely new scenario in a perpetual restructuring transition, in which the way we live, relate, and communicate with others has been altered permanently. Within this context, risk communication is playing a decisive role when informing, transmitting, and channeling the flow of information in society. COVID-19 has posed a real pandemic risk management challenge in terms of impact, preparedness, response, and mitigation by governments, health organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), mass media, and stakeholders. In this study, we monitored the digital ecosystems during March and April 2020, and we obtained a sample of 106,261 communications through the analysis of APIs and Web Scraping techniques.

In this context, autopsies are important to confirm the disease, determine associated conditions, and study the pathophysiology of this novel disease. The aim of this study was to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19. In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy (MIA-US), and we present the results of 10 initial autopsies. Methods and results: We used MIA-US for tissue sampling of the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA. All patients showed exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients, and all patients showed a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in the glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection, such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis, and orchitis. Conclusions: MIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease causing major events in the lungs and with involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes result from severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena. These findings indicate that both epithelial and vascular injury should be addressed in therapeutic approaches. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","autopsy; COVID-19; diffuse alveolar damage; lung pathology; minimally invasive autopsy; SARS-CoV-2",,"32443177","Histopathology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086234159

METHODS: Collected samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City, each of sample was divided into 5 groups (groupA∼E): A:Non-inactivated raw sample; B:75 % ethanol inactivation; C:56 ℃ incubation for 30 min inactivation; D:65 ℃ incubation for 10 min inactivation; E:Pre-inactivation using RNA virus special preservation fluid added into the sampling tube to treated the nasopharyngeal swab sample separately, using real-time fluorescent RT-PCR to detect the N gene of COVID-19 and the ORF1ab gene simultaneously. All the groups are diluted in 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 ratios. The objectives are to compare the effect of the varied inactivation method on CT(Cycle Threshold)results in PCR, conduct correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P＜0.001). The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency. CONCLUSION: The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Lab test-persons can flexibly adopt pre-inactivation methods to ensure the accuracy of virus nucleic acid test results, meanwhile guarantee the safety of lab test-persons.

Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. Methods To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six Black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury–associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. Results This case series included six Black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/ diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. Conclusions Collapsing glomerulopathy in Black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a “two-hit” combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given this entity’s resemblance with HIV-associated nephropathy, we propose the term COVID-19–associated nephropathy to describe it. © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology",,,"32561682","J. Am.

The formula is in terms of the fraction of positive test results and test parameters, i.e., probability of true positives (sensitivity) and the probability of true negatives (specificity). The motivation of this work arises in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in which estimating the number of infected individuals depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. In this context, it is shown that approximating the prevalence ratio by the ratio between the number of positive tests and the total number of tested individuals leads to dramatically high estimation errors, and thus, unadapted public health policies. The relevance of estimating the prevalence ratio using the formula presented in this work is that precision increases with the number of tests. Two conclusions are drawn from this work. First, in order to ensure that a reliable estimation is achieved with a finite number of tests, testing campaigns must be implemented with tests for which the sum of the sensitivity and the specificity is sufficiently different than one. Second, the key parameter for reducing the estimation error is the number of tests. For a large number of tests, as long as the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is different than one, the exact values of these parameters have very little impact on the estimation error. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the association between asthma and COVID-19 has not been well-established. Objective: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19 in a major US health system. We assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients with COVID-19. We also determined the risk of hospitalization associated with asthma and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. Methods: Medical records of patients with COVID-19 were searched by a computer algorithm (March 1 to April 15, 2020), and chart review was used to validate the diagnosis of asthma and medications prescribed for asthma. All patients had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Demographic and clinical features were characterized. Regression models were used to assess the associations between asthma and corticosteroid use and the risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization. Results: Of 1526 patients identified with COVID-19, 220 (14%) were classified as having asthma. Asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The ongoing use of inhaled corticosteroids did not increase the risk of hospitalization in a similar adjusted model (relative risk, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.90-2.15). Conclusions: Despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our COVID-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. Similarly, the use of inhaled corticosteroids with or without systemic corticosteroids was not associated with COVID-19–related hospitalization. © 2020","allergic rhinitis; asthma; corticosteroid; COVID-19; long-acting β-agonist; morbidity; rhinosinusitis; risk factors; SARS-CoV-2; severity","corticosteroid; adult; age; aged; algorithm; Article; asthma; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; female; health care system; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; prevalence; priority journal; sex; United States","32554082","J.

The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. Patient-reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID-19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID-19 patients has been performed. Methods: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated 40-odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 60 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction. A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the 2 groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex. Results: Fifty-nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction (mean [95% CI] UPSIT score: 20.98 [19.47, 22.48]; controls: 34.10 [33.31, 34.88]; p < 0.0001). Thirty-five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and 1 normosmia (1/60; 2%). Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants. No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found. Conclusion: Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine. © 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC","biomarker; chronic rhinosinusitis; COVID-19; olfaction; olfactory disorders; olfactory test; UPSIT","biological marker; fragrance; adult; anosmia; Article; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease marker; disease severity; female; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; microsmia; odor; priority journal; sex; smelling disorder; Betacoronavirus; chronic disease; Coronavirus infection; differential threshold; isolation and purification; middle aged; pandemic; pathophysiology; Pennsylvania; reproducibility; rhinitis; risk factor; sinusitis; smelling; smelling disorder; virus pneumonia; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Differential Threshold; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odorants; Olfaction Disorders; Olfactory Perception; Pandemics; Pennsylvania; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Rhinitis; Risk Factors; Sino-Nasal Outcome Test; Sinusitis; Smell","32301284","Int.

Positivity of IgM OR IgG for LFA resulted in a decrease in specificity compared to IgG alone without a gain in diagnostic performance, except for VivaDiag. The results for IgM varied significantly between the LFAs with an average overall agreement of only 70% compared to 89% for IgG. The average dynamic trend to seropositivity for IgM was not shorter than for IgG. At the time of hospital admission the sensitivity of LFA was <60%. Conclusions: Sensitivity for the detection of IgG antibodies 14–25 days after the onset of symptoms was ≥92.1% for all seven LFAs compared to 89.5% for the IgG ELISA. The results for IgM varied significantly, and including IgM antibodies in addition to IgG for the interpretation of LFAs did not improve the diagnostic performance. © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","COVID-19; Diagnosis; ELISA; Immunoassay; Lateral flow assay; Point-of-care testing; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity and specificity; Seroconversion","immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody; unclassified drug; virus antibody; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; virus antigen; adult; aged; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; false negative result; false positive result; female; hospital admission; human; intermethod comparison; limit of agreement; major clinical study; male; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; seroconversion; serodiagnosis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; trend study; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic test; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; pandemic; time factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time Factors; Young Adult","32473953","Clin.

Older age, male sex and certain underlying diseases, including cancer, appear to significantly increase the risk for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells is facilitated by the angiotensin.converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), and by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and other host cell proteases such as cathepsin L (CTSL). With the exception of ACE-2, a systematic analysis of these two other SARS-CoV2 infection mediators in malignancies is lacking. Here, we analysed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 and CTSL across a wide spectrum of tumors and controls. TMPRSS2 was overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma, with PRAD and READ exhibiting the highest expression of all cancers. CTSL was upregulated in lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B.cell lymphoma, oesophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lower grade glioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thymoma. Hypo.methylation of both genes was evident in most cases where they have been highly upregulated. We have expanded on our observations by including data relating to mutations and copy number alterations at pan.cancer level. The novel hypotheses that are stemming out of these data need to be further investigated and validated in large clinical studies. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the level in the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than among COVID-19-negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%) (P 0.001). COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, which, when excluded, reduced the bacteremia rate to 1.6%. More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation. Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial coinfection. Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during patient surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days, if necessary, to free additional capacity. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis, devastating the social, economic and political aspects of life. Many clinicians, health professionals, scientists, organizations, and governments have actively defeated COVID-19 and shared their experiences of the SARS-CoV2. Diabetes is one of the major risk factors for fatal outcomes from COVID-19. Patients with diabetes are vulnerable to infection because of hyperglycemia; impaired immune function; vascular complications; and comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. Hence, the use of angiotensin-directed medications in patients with diabetes requires attention. The severity and mortality from COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients with diabetes than in those without. Thus, the patients with diabetes should take precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we review the current knowledge of COVID-19 including the global and regional epidemiology, virology, impact of diabetes on COVID-19, treatment of COVID-19, and standard of care in the management of diabetes during this critical period. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19); Diabetes mellitus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; calcium channel blocking agent; corticosteroid; dapagliflozin; favipiravir; galidesivir; hydroxychloroquine; liraglutide; lopinavir; metformin; oxygen; pioglitazone; recombinant protein; remdesivir; ribavirin; ritonavir; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; tocilizumab; Article; blood glucose monitoring; blood pressure monitoring; caloric intake; clinical feature; conservative treatment; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; disease severity; extracorporeal oxygenation; feeding behavior; glycemic control; health care quality; human; hypertension; incidence; information service; medication compliance; mobile application; mortality; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; pathogenesis; physical activity; prevalence; protein function; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sleep pattern; South Korea; telemedicine; virus transmission","32623038","Diabetes Res.

Methods: All patients referred to the emergency departments, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Two radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience) reviewed all the X-ray images and evaluated the following findings: interstitial opacities, alveolar opacities (AO), AO associated with consolidation, consolidation and/or pleural effusion. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old). Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications. Results: A total of 468 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Lung lesions primarily manifested as interstitial opacities (71.7%) and AO opacities (60.5%), more frequently bilateral (64.5%) and with a peripheral predominance (62.5%). Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral. Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones. Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. Conclusions: The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities. Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; Infections; Radiography; Tomography; X-ray computed","contrast medium; adult; Article; clinician; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; demography; diagnostic imaging; dyspnea; emergency ward; female; hospital; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; image analysis; Italy; lung alveolus; lung complication; lung interstitium; lung lesion; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; multidetector computed tomography; pandemic; pleura effusion; priority journal; radiologist; radiology department; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; thorax radiography; X ray","32469732","Respir.

The present study seeks to understand the response of OHNS workflows in the context of policy changes and to contribute to developing preparatory guidelines for perioperative management in OHNS. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Pediatric and general adult academic medical centers and a Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). Subjects and Methods: OHNS cases from March 18 to April 8, 2020—the 3 weeks immediately following the Ohio state-mandated suspension of all elective surgery on March 18, 2020—were compared with a 2019 control data set. Results: During this time, OHNS at the general adult and pediatric medical centers and CCC experienced 87.8%, 77.1%, and 32% decreases in surgical procedures as compared with 2019, respectively. Aerosol-generating procedures accounted for 86.8% of general adult cases, 92.4% of pediatric cases, and 62.0% of CCC cases. Preoperative COVID-19 testing occurred in 7.1% of general adult, 9% of pediatric, and 6.9% of CCC cases. The majority of procedures were tiers 3a and 3b per the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Aerosol-protective personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn in 28.6% of general adult, 90% of pediatric, and 15.5% of CCC cases. Conclusion: For OHNS, the majority of essential surgical cases remained high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. Preoperative COVID-19 testing and intraoperative PPE usage were initially inconsistent; systemwide guidelines were developed rapidly but lagged behind recommendations of the OHNS department and its academy. OHNS best practice standards are needed for preoperative COVID-19 status screening and PPE usage as we begin national reopening. © The Author(s) 2020.","airway management; coronavirus disease; COVID-19; intubation; otolaryngology; preparatory response; SARS-CoV-2","adult; aerosol; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; ear nose throat disease; elective surgery; female; human; infant; laboratory technique; legislation and jurisprudence; male; middle aged; Ohio; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; practice guideline; preoperative care; preschool child; retrospective study; risk; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aerosols; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Ohio; Otolaryngology; Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Preoperative Care; Retrospective Studies; Risk","32482131","Otolaryngol.

Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3–85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a non-statistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function tests including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased. The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse. IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality. In a binary logistic regression model, C-reactive protein level (OR 1.073, [CI, 1.013–1.136]; p = 0.017), CD8 T lymphocyte counts (OR 0.989, [CI, 0.979–1.000]; p = 0.043), and D-dimer (OR 5.313, [CI, 0.325–86.816]; p = 0.241) were independent predictors of disease severity. © 2020","2019 novel coronavirus disease; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Elevated liver enzymes; Interleukin-6; Lymphocyte subsets; Mortality; Prognosis; SARS-CoV-2","biological marker; adolescent; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; child; China; Coronavirus infection; female; human; leukocyte count; male; metabolism; middle aged; pandemic; preschool child; severity of illness index; sex factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors","32439209","J.

The electrocardiographic (ECG) changes which may occur during hospitalization for COVID-19 have not yet been comprehensively assessed. Patients and methods:. We examined 50 patients admitted to hospital with proven COVID-19 pneumonia. At entry, all patients underwent a detailed clinical examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory tests and arterial blood gas test. ECG was also recorded at discharge and in case of worsening clinical conditions. Results:. Mean age of patients was 64 years and 72% were men. At baseline, 30% of patients had ST-T abnormalities, and 33% had left ventricular hypertrophy. During hospitalization, 26% of patients developed new ECG abnormalities which included atrial fibrillation, ST-T changes, tachy-brady syndrome, and changes consistent with acute pericarditis. One patient was transferred to intensive care unit for massive pulmonary embolism with right bundle branch block, and another for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patients free of ECG changes during hospitalization were more likely to be treated with antiretrovirals (68% vs 15%, p = 0.001) and hydroxychloroquine (89% vs 62%, p = 0.026) versus those who developed ECG abnormalities after admission. Most measurable ECG features at discharge did not show significant changes from baseline (all p>0.05) except for a slightly decrease in Cornell voltages (13±6 vs 11±5 mm; p = 0.0001) and a modest increase in the PR interval. The majority (54%) of patients with ECG abnormalities had 2 prior consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs. ECG abnormalities were first detected after an average of about 30 days from symptoms’ onset (range 12–51 days). Conclusions:.

Methods: This was a prospective descriptive study comprising 147 consecutive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients who underwent CT chest. Prevalence, distribution, extent and type of abnormal lung findings were recorded. Results: Among the total study cohort of 147 patients, 104 (70.7 %) were males and 43 (29.3 %) were females with mean age of 40.9 ± 17.2 years (range 24–71 years). We observed lung parenchymal abnormalities in 51 (34.7 %) cases whereas 96 (65.3 %) RT-PCR positive cases had a normal chest CT. Only 12.2 % of the patients were dyspneic, 6.1 % had desaturation, 7.4 % had increased respiratory rate and 10.9 % had comorbidities. Among the patients with abnormal CT findings bilateral 39/51 (76.5 %), multilobar (88.2 %) lung involvement with a predominant peripheral and posterior distribution was commonly observed. With regards to the type of opacity, ground glass opacity (GGO) was the dominant abnormality found in all 51 (100 %) cases. Pure GGO was observed in 15 (29.4 %), GGO with crazy paving pattern was seen in 15 (29.4 %) and GGO mixed with consolidation was noted in 21(41.2 %). Peri-lesional or intralesional segmental or subsegmental pulmonary vessel enlargement was observed in 36 (70.6 %) cases. Conclusion: In this study population predominantly with mild symptoms and few comorbidities, two-thirds of RT-PCR positive patients had a normal chest CT; whereas the remaining patients showed typical findings of predominant GGOs with a bilateral distribution and peripheral predominance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; CT; SARS-CoV-2","adult; aged; Article; breathing rate; cohort analysis; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; dyspnea; female; ground glass opacity; human; India; lung consolidation; lung edema; lung lesion; major clinical study; male; observational study; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; pulmonary vessel enlargement; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; hypertrophy; laboratory technique; lung; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; tachypnea; thorax; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Dyspnea; Female; Humans; Hypertrophy; India; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Tachypnea; Thorax; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","32623113","Eur.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the preprint server MedRxiv from their inception until May 11, 2020, using the terms anosmia or hyposmia or dysosmia or olfactory dysfunction or olfaction disorder or smell dysfunction or ageusia or hypogeusia or dysgeusia or taste dysfunction or gustatory dysfunction or neurological and COVID-19 or 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2. The references of included studies were also manually screened. Only studies involving patients with diagnostic-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Results: Twenty-four studies with data from 8438 patients with test-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 13 countries were included. The pooled proportions of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction were 41.0% (95% CI, 28.5% to 53.9%) and 38.2% (95% CI, 24.0% to 53.6%), respectively. Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = −0.076; P=.02) and gustatory (coefficient = −0.073; P=.03) dysfunctions. There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared with self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; P=.01). No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by sex was observed. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19. Routine screening for these conditions could contribute to improved case detection in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, to better inform population screening measures, further studies are needed to establish causality. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",,"Article; coronavirus disease 2019; correlational study; data analysis; groups by age; human; prevalence; quality control; self report; sex; smelling disorder; systematic review; taste disorder","32753137","Mayo Clin.

Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4–8 h to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1–10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Diagnostic; Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP); Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)","virus RNA; primer DNA; virus RNA; Article; clinical effectiveness; clinical protocol; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; human; intermethod comparison; loop mediated isothermal amplification; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; early diagnosis; economics; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; molecular diagnosis; nucleic acid amplification; pandemic; procedures; time factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; DNA Primers; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time Factors","32361529","Med.

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories.

In the United States (U.S.), there have been over 2,000,000 confirmed cases and over 110,000 confirmed deaths. COVID-19 case data in the United States has been updated daily at the county level since the first case was reported in January of 2020. There currently lacks a study that showcases the novelty of daily COVID-19 surveillance using space-time cluster detection techniques. In this paper, we utilize a prospective Poisson space-time scan statistic to detect daily clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the contiguous 48 U.S. and Washington D.C. As the pandemic progresses, we generally find an increase of smaller clusters of remarkably steady relative risk. Daily tracking of significant space-time clusters can facilitate decision-making and public health resource allocation by evaluating and visualizing the size, relative risk, and locations that are identified as COVID-19 hotspots. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Disease surveillance; Pandemic; SaTScan; Space-time clusters","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; health statistics; human; major clinical study; medical decision making; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; prospective study; resource allocation; risk factor; Washington",,"Spat.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of the first 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 after thoracic surgery in early January 2020. Postoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records and the time line of clinical course were summarized. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated. Results: In the 11 confirmed cases (3 female, 8 male), median days from symptom onset to case detection was 8. Insidious symptom onset and misinterpreted postoperative changes on chest computed tomography (CT) resulted in delay in diagnosis. There were 3 fatalities due to respiratory failure, whereas 4 severe and 4 mild cases recovered and were discharged. All patients had once experienced leukocytosis and eosinopenia. Remittent fever and resected lung segments ≥5 were associated with fatality. Conclusions: The case fatality rate of postsurgical patients subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 was 27.3%. Insidious symptom onset, postoperative leukocytosis with lymphopenia, and postsurgical CT changes overshadowed the early signs of viral pneumonia. Dynamic symptom monitoring, serial chest CTs, and tests for viral RNA and serum antibody improve the chance for prompt detection of COVID-19.

To protect medical laboratory personnel from infection, most laboratories inactivate the virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in clinical samples before testing. However, the effect of inactivation on the detection results remains unknown. Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal swab samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number. Viral inactivation was performed by three different methods: (i) incubation with the TRIzol LS reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (ii) heating in a water bath at 56°C for 30 min, and (iii) high-temperature treatment, including autoclaving at 121°C for 20 min, boiling at 100°C for 20 min, and heating at 80°C for 20 min. Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and 39.85% of open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. For samples treated at 56°C for 30 min, the copy number of the N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively. The viral RNA copy number dropped by 50 to 66% after heating at 80°C for 20 min. Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min. These results indicate that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false-negative results, especially in weakly positive cases. Thus, use of the TRIzol reagent rather than heat inactivation is recommended for sample inactivation, as the TRIzol reagent had the least effect on the RNA copy number among the tested methods. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

For informing individuals whether they have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they need to be very accurate. For measuring population prevalence of past infection, the numbers of false positives and negatives need to be roughly equal. With a series of worked examples for a notional population of 100,000 people, we show that even test systems with a high specificity can yield a large number of false positive results, especially where the population prevalence is low. For example, at a true population prevalence of 5%, using a test with 99% sensitivity and specificity, 16% of positive results will be false and thus 950 people will be incorrectly informed they have had the infection. Further confirmatory testing may be needed.

Study design: Children 1 month to 21 years of age with COVID-19 from a single tertiary care children's hospital between March 15 and April 13, 2020 were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results: In total, 67 children tested positive for COVID-19; 21 (31.3%) were managed as outpatients. Of 46 admitted patients, 33 (72%) were admitted to the general pediatric medical unit and 13 (28%) to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Obesity and asthma were highly prevalent but not significantly associated with PICU admission (P = .99). Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (P < .05 for all). Patients in the PICU were more likely to require high-flow nasal cannula (P = .0001) and were more likely to have received Remdesivir through compassionate release (P < .05). Severe sepsis and septic shock syndromes were observed in 7 (53.8%) patients in the PICU. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was observed in 10 (77%) PICU patients, 6 of whom (46.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 9 days. Of the 13 patients in the PICU, 8 (61.5%) were discharged home, and 4 (30.7%) patients remain hospitalized on ventilatory support at day 14. One patient died after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy because of metastatic cancer.

WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates. Methods: A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs. Findings: Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3–4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0–5·0). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0–99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2–32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6–8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts. Interpretation: Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

The challenges associated with COVID-19 are even greater for patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis, a rare multisystemic disease affecting the heart, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal and nervous system. Patients with AL amyloidosis may need to receive chemotherapy, which probably increases infection risk. Management of COVID-19 may be particularly challenging in patients with AL amyloidosis, who often present with cardiac dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, neuropathy, low blood pressure and gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, patients with AL amyloidosis may be more susceptible to toxicities of drugs used to manage COVID-19. Access to health care may be difficult or limited, diagnosis of AL amyloidosis may be delayed with detrimental consequences and treatment administration may need modification.

At the time of writing this article, more than 17,500 elderly people that lived in Care Homes have died due to coronavirus, more than 66% of the deaths. The infection and mortality rates in the institutionalised population are high. This is due to the advanced age, immune system deficit, and the presence of comorbidities, as well as because there are frail, because they live with other residents and carers in a closed institution, and transmission is easy in the context of a highly contagious and virulent virus. The elderly often have more severe forms of the disease. Atypical presentations are more frequent in the elderly and can delay the diagnosis. The Polymer Chain Reaction (PCR) test in the first 7 days for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is considered the test of reference (‘Gold standard’). The criteria for referring to a hospital site from Care Homes should take into account an assessment of comorbidity, the severity, the presence of severe cognitive impairment, and the dependency or necessity of ventilatory support in seriously ill patients. The social-health centres should have contingency plans available in order to offer a response when cases of COVID-19 appear. Isolation during pandemics may have important physical and psychosocial consequences in the residents. It is necessary to reflect and claim a new residential model from a person-centered care approach that seeks the integration of health and social services. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Médicos de Atención Primaria (SEMERGEN)","Care Homes; COVID-19; Geriatrics; Older",,,"Semergen",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087025387

The objective of this study was to investigate the droplet and splatter contamination from common otologic procedures. Study Design: Cadaver simulation series. Setting: Dedicated surgical laboratory. Methods: Two cadaver heads were prepped via bilateral middle cranial fossa approaches to the tegmen (n = 4). Fluorescein was instilled through a 4-mm burr hole drilled into the middle cranial fossa floor, and presence in the middle ear was confirmed via microscopic ear examination. Myringotomy with ventilation tube placement and mastoidectomy were performed, and the distribution and distance of resulting droplet splatter patterns were systematically evaluated. Results: There were no fluorescein droplets or splatter contamination observed in the measured surgical field in any direction after myringotomy and insertion of ventilation tube. Gross contamination from the surgical site to 6 ft was noted after complete mastoidectomy, though, when performed in standard fashion. Conclusion: Our results show that there is no droplet generation during myringotomy with ventilation tube placement in an operating room setting. Mastoidectomy, however, showed gross contamination 3 to 6 ft away in all directions measured. Additionally, there was significantly more droplet and splatter generation to the left of the surgeon when measured at 1 and 3 ft as compared with all other measured directions. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; droplets; mastoidectomy; myringotomy; otologic surgery; splatter","Betacoronavirus; cadaver; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; human; mastoidectomy; middle ear ventilation; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cadaver; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Mastoidectomy; Middle Ear Ventilation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32423287","Otolaryngol.

Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19. The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Design: BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 34 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days. The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days. Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, and troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP, and D-dimer levels.

Methods: Patients presenting to a Dutch teaching hospital were eligible between 17 March and 10 April 2020, when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for COVID-19. The performances of six different LFAs were evaluated in plasma samples obtained on corresponding respiratory sample dates of NATs testing. Subsequently, the best performing LFA was evaluated in 228 patients and in 50 sera of a historical patient control group. Results: In the pilot analysis, sensitivity characteristics of LFA were heterogeneous, ranging from 2/20 (10%; 95% CI 0%–23%) to 11/20 (55%; 95% CI 33%–77%). In the total cohort, Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test LFA had a sensitivity of 43/99 (43%; 95% CI 34%–53%) and specificity of 126/129 (98%; 95% CI 95%–100%). Sensitivity increased to 31/52 (60%; 95% CI 46%–73%) in patients with at least 7 days of symptoms, and to 21/33 (64%; 95% CI 47%–80%) in patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥100 mg/L. Sensitivity and specificity of Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA was 59/95 (62%; 95% CI 52%–72%) and 125/128 (98%; 95% CI 95%–100%) in all patients, respectively, but sensitivity increased to 38/48 (79%; 95% CI 68%–91%) in patients with at least 7 days of symptoms. Conclusions: There is large variability in diagnostic test performance between rapid LFAs, but overall limited sensitivity and high specificity in acutely admitted patients. Sensitivity improved in patients with longer existing symptoms or high CRP. LFAs should only be considered as additional triage tools when these may lead to the improvement of hospital logistics. © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","Coronavirus disease 2019; ELISA; Lateral flow immunoassay; Rapid test; Serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","virus antibody; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; blood; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; female; genetics; human; immunoassay; immunology; isolation and purification; male; nucleic acid amplification; pandemic; pilot study; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; teaching hospital; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Immunoassay; Male; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32502646","Clin.

The isolate I0305/19 was clustered together with viruses in sublineage D of GI-19 lineage on the basis of the complete S1 sequence analysis. Isolate I0305/19 and other GI-19 viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110–112 in the S protein. Further analysis based on the complete genomic sequence showed that the isolate emerged through at least four recombination events between GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848- and GI-13 4/91-like strains, in which the S gene was found to be similar to that of the GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848-like strain. Pathological assessment showed the isolate was a nephropathogenic IBV strain that caused high morbidity of 100 % and mortality of 80 % in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. The isolate I0305/19 exhibited broader tropisms in different tissues, including tracheas, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils. Furthermore, subpopulations of the virus were found in tissues of infected chickens; this finding is important in understanding how the virulent IBV strains can potentially replicate and evolve to cause disease. This information is also valuable for understanding the mechanisms of replication and evolution of other coronaviruses such as the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Broader tissue tropism; GI-19 lineage; High pathogenicity; Infectious bronchitis virus; Multiple recombination events","virus RNA; vitronectin; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; Article; avian infectious bronchitis; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; broiler; bursa Fabricii; cecal tonsil; cecum; chick; China; genomics; germfree chicken; kidney tissue; large intestine tissue; liver tissue; lung parenchyma; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; proventriculus; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; small intestine tissue; spleen tissue; trachea tissue; viral tropism; virus genome; virus isolation; virus particle; virus recombination; virus replication; virus strain; virus virulence; animal; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; bird disease; chicken; classification; Coronavirus infection; genetic recombination; genetics; germfree animal; pathogenicity; phylogeny; physiology; veterinary medicine; virology; Animals; Chickens; China; Coronavirus Infections; Genome, Viral; Infectious bronchitis virus; Phylogeny; Poultry Diseases; Recombination, Genetic; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Viral Tropism; Virus Replication","32380209","Virus Res.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084260715

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (6standard deviation) was 49 years 6 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P , .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusion: A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions. © RSNA, 2020.",,"adult; aged; artificial intelligence; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; community acquired infection; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; female; human; laboratory technique; male; middle aged; multicenter study; pandemic; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; three-dimensional imaging; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Community-Acquired Infections; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32191588","Radiology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083205134

We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice. Method: We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis. Result: COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P < 0.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19. When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined. Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection.

Against the backdrop of this pandemic, it becomes imperative to study the effects of this infection on pregnancy and its outcome. Hence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 infection on the maternal morbidity and mortality, the course of labour as well as the neonatal outcome. Materials and Methods: A total of 977 pregnant women were included in the study, from 1st April to 15th May 2020 at a tertiary care hospital. There were 141 women who tested COVID positive and remaining 836 patients were included in the COVID negative group. Findings were compared in both the groups. Results: The incidence of COVID positive pregnant women was found to be 14.43%. More patients delivered by LSCS in the COVID positive and the COVID negative group (50%) as compared to COVID negative group (47%), (p > 0.05). Low APGAR score (0-3) was observed in 2(1.52%) neonates of COVID positive mothers and in 15 (1.91%) neonates of COVID negative mothers. Overall most of the babies were healthy. Out of all babies tested, 3 were detected positive initially which were retested on day 5 and were found to be negative. Conclusion: There is no significant effect of COVID infection on maternal and foetal outcome in pregnancy and there is no evidence of vertical transmission of the COVID-19 infection but long-term follow-up of these babies is recommended. © 2020, Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India.","APGAR; COVID-19; Morbidity; Mortality; Neonate; Pandemic; Pregnancy","antibiotic agent; hydroxychloroquine; adult; Apgar score; Article; baby; cesarean section; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; fetus outcome; follow up; human; incidence; instrumental delivery; major clinical study; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; newborn; oxygen therapy; pregnancy; pregnant woman; priority journal; tertiary care center; vaginal delivery; vertical transmission",,"J.

As of April 23, 2020, 2.7 million cases have been confirmed, over 190,000 people are dead, and about 750,000 people are reported recovered. Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests. Methods: We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. Results: Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans. Conclusions: Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient’s CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Deep learning; Detection bias","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; child; classification; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; entropy; false negative result; false positive result; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; very elderly","32462314","Int.

With the aim to face the COVID-19 data collection, harmonization and integration problems, we present the design and development of COVID-WAREHOUSE, a data warehouse that models, integrates and stores the COVID-19 data made available daily by the Italian Protezione Civile Department and several pollution and climate data made available by the Italian Regions. After an automatic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) step, COVID-19 cases, pollution measures and climate data, are integrated and organized using the Dimensional Fact Model, using two main dimensions: time and geographical location. COVID-WAREHOUSE supports OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) analysis, provides a heatmap visualizer, and allows easy extraction of selected data for further analysis. The proposed tool can be used in the context of Public Health to underline how the pandemic is spreading, with respect to time and geographical location, and to correlate the pandemic to pollution and climate data in a specific region. Moreover, public decision-makers could use the tool to discover combinations of pollution and climate conditions correlated to an increase of the pandemic, and thus, they could act in a consequent manner. Case studies based on data cubes built on data from Lombardia and Puglia regions are discussed. Our preliminary findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic is significantly spread in regions characterized by high concentration of particulate in the air and the absence of rain and wind, as even stated in other works available in literature. © 2020 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: Our Department is the only urologic service in the Trento Province, near Lombardy, the epicenter of Covid-19 in our Country. We reviewed the surgical and ward activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9 to April 5, 2020). The following outcomes were investigated: surgical load, rate of admissions and bed occupation, and the rate and characteristics of unrecognized Covid-positive patients. Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11 to April 7). Results and Conclusion: About 63%, 70%, 64%, and 71%, decline in surgery, endoscopy, bed occupation, and admission, respectively, occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to 2019. Urgent procedures also declined by 32%. Three (8%) of 39 admissions regarded unrecognized Covid-19 overlapping or misinterpreted with urgent urologic conditions such as fever-associated urinary stones or hematuria. In spite of a significant reduction of activity, a non-negligible portion of admissions to our Covid-free unit regarded unrecognized Covid-19. In order to preserve its integrity, we propose an enhanced triage prior to the admission to a Covid-free unit including not only routine questions on fever and respiratory symptoms but also nonrespiratory symptoms, history of exposure, and a survey about the social and geographic origin of the patient. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"adult; aged; Article; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; emergency health service; endoscopy; female; fever; health care system; hematuria; hospital admission; hospital bed utilization; hospital department; human; hydronephrosis; Italy; male; middle aged; partial nephrectomy; priority journal; prostate cancer; quarantine; sepsis; ureter stone; urologic surgery; urology; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; hospital department; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Aged; Bed Occupancy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Admission; Pneumonia, Viral; Triage; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Urology Department, Hospital","32425267","Urology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086173495

Aim: Our aim was to determine if online searches for COVID-19 related to international media announcements or national epidemiology. Methods: Searches for “coronavirus” were made on Google Trends from December 31, 2019 to April 13, 2020 for 40 European countries. The online COVID-19 searches for all countries were correlated with each other. COVID-10 epidemiology (i.e. incidence and mortality) was correlated with the national online searches. Major announcements by the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken into consideration with peaks in online searches. Correlations were made using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range −0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range −0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99). Conclusions: Online searches for COVID-19 in Europe are not correlated with epidemiology but strongly correlated with international WHO announcements. Our study challenges previous Google Trends studies and emphasizes the role of the WHO in raising awareness of a new disease. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Europe; Google Trends; Risk communication; Surveillance","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; epidemiological data; Europe; global disease burden; human; incidence; mortality; online system; pandemic; social media; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; mass medium; search engine; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe; Humans; Incidence; Mass Media; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Search Engine; World Health Organization","32535297","Int.

Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: This study included 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With use of RT-PCR as the reference standard, the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed. In addition, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with a time interval between RT-PCR tests of 4 days or more. Results: Of the 1014 patients, 601 of 1014 (59%) had positive RT-PCR results and 888 of 1014 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95% confidence interval: 95%, 98%; 580 of 601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In the 413 patients with negative RT-PCR results, 308 of 413 (75%) had positive chest CT findings. Of those 308 patients, 48% (103 of 308) were considered as highly likely cases and 33% (103 of 308) as probable cases. At analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days 6 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days 6 2.3. Of the 1014 patients, 60% (34 of 57) to 93% (14 of 15) had initial positive CT scans consistent with COVID-19 before (or parallel to) the initial positive RT-PCR results. Twenty-four of 57 patients (42%) showed improvement on follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turned negative. Conclusion: Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas. © RSNA, 2020.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; China; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; female; follow up; human; laboratory technique; male; middle aged; pandemic; preschool child; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","32101510","Radiology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083198863

Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Key findings: The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. Conclusion: In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. Implications for practice: An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners.

Purpose To investigate CT features of patients with COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, and to compare the accuracy of CT with that of RT-PCR. Materials and Methods In this prospective study from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were contrast material-enhanced chest CT performed for vascular indications, patients who refused chest CT or hospitalization, and severe CT motion artifact. All patients underwent RT-PCR and chest CT. Diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using RT-PCR as the reference standard. Chest CT features were calculated in a subgroup of patients with positive RT-PCR and CT findings. CT features of hospitalized patients and patients in home isolation were compared using the Pearson χ2 test. Results The study population included 158 consecutive participants (83 male, 75 female; mean age, 57 years ± 17 [standard deviation]). Of the 158 participants, fever was observed in 97 (61%), cough was observed in 88 (56%), dyspnea was observed in 52 (33%), lymphocytopenia was observed in 95 (60%), increased C-reactive protein level was observed in 139 (88%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level was observed in 128 (81%). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT were 97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88%, 99%) (60 of 62), 56% (95% CI: 45%, 66%) (54 of 96), and 72% (95% CI: 64%, 78%) (114 of 158), respectively. In the subgroup of 58 participants with positive RT-PCR and CT findings, ground-glass opacities were present in all 58 (100%), both multilobe and posterior involvement were present in 54 (93%), bilateral pneumonia was present in 53 (91%), and subsegmental vessel enlargement (>3 mm) was present in 52 (89%). Conclusion The typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Rome, Italy, was peripheral ground-glass opacities with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (>3 mm).

RESULTS: 3% (13/439) of CT examinations demonstrated findings of classic/probable COVID-19 pneumonia, whilst 4% (19/439) had findings indeterminate for COVID-19. Of the total cohort, 1.6% (7/439) subsequently had confirmed RT-PCR-positive COVID-19. Importantly, all the patients with a normal chest or alternative diagnoses on CT who had PCR testing within the next 7 days, had a negative RT-PCR (92/407). There was a change in surgical outcome in 6% (10/156) of the elective surgical cohort with no change to surgical management was demonstrated in the acute abdominal emergency cohort requiring surgery (2/283). CONCLUSION: There was a 7% (32/439) incidence of potential COVID-19-related lung changes in patients having preoperative CT. Although this altered surgical management in the elective surgical cohort, no change to surgical management was demonstrated in the acute abdominal emergency cohort requiring surgery. © 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists",,"adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; elective surgery; emergency surgery; human; major clinical study; outcome assessment; practice guideline; priority journal; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; surgical patient; tertiary care center; thorax radiography; thorax surgery; United Kingdom; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; elective surgery; female; hospital emergency service; lung; male; middle aged; pandemic; preoperative care; procedures; thorax radiography; very elderly; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Preoperative Care; Radiography, Thoracic; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; United Kingdom; Young Adult","32593409","Clin.

Our research aims were to characterize the changepoint in the flow of the COVID-19 epidemic in each European country and to evaluate the association of the level of social distancing with the observed decline in the national epidemics. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in 28 European countries. Social distance index was calculated based on Google Community Mobility Reports. Changepoints were estimated by threshold regression, national findings were analyzed by Poisson regression, and the effect of social distancing in mixed effects Poisson regression model. Our findings identified the most probable changepoints in 28 European countries. Before changepoint, incidence of new COVID-19 cases grew by 24% per day on average. From the changepoint, this growth rate was reduced to 0.9%, 0.3% increase, and to 0.7% and 1.7% decrease by increasing social distancing quartiles. The beneficial effect of higher social distance quartiles (i.e., turning the increase into decline) was statistically significant for the fourth quartile. Notably, many countries in lower quartiles also achieved a flat epidemic curve. In these countries, other plausible COVID-19 containment measures could contribute to controlling the first wave of the disease. The association of social distance quartiles with viral spread could also be hindered by local bottlenecks in infection control. Our results allow for moderate optimism related to the gradual lifting of social distance measures in the general population, and call for specific attention to the protection of focal micro-societies enriching high-risk elderly subjects, including nursing homes and chronic care facilities. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Europe; Google community mobility reports; Interrupted time series analysis; Social distance","Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; epidemic; Europe; growth rate; health care facility; health care policy; high risk population; human; incidence; infection control; nursing home; pandemic; social distance; telemonitoring","32529592","GeroScience",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086441300

Objectives: To investigate the incidence of objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Single-center cohort study of 198 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Seventy-five patients (38%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). At time of data collection, 16 (8%) were still hospitalized and 19% had died. During a median follow-up of 7 days (IQR, 3-13), 39 patients (20%) were diagnosed with VTE of whom 25 (13%) had symptomatic VTE, despite routine thrombosis prophylaxis. The cumulative incidences of VTE at 7, 14 and 21 days were 16% (95% CI, 10-22), 33% (95% CI, 23-43) and 42% (95% CI 30-54) respectively. For symptomatic VTE, these were 10% (95% CI, 5.8-16), 21% (95% CI, 14-30) and 25% (95% CI 16-36). VTE appeared to be associated with death (adjusted HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.02-5.5). The cumulative incidence of VTE was higher in the ICU (26% (95% CI, 17-37), 47% (95% CI, 34-58), and 59% (95% CI, 42-72) at 7, 14 and 21 days) than on the wards (any VTE and symptomatic VTE 5.8% (95% CI, 1.4-15), 9.2% (95% CI, 2.6-21), and 9.2% (2.6-21) at 7, 14, and 21 days). Conclusions: The observed risk for VTE in COVID-19 is high, particularly in ICU patients, which should lead to a high level of clinical suspicion and low threshold for diagnostic imaging for DVT or PE. Future research should focus on optimal diagnostic and prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE and potentially improve survival. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: A simulation training exercise was designed as a departmental initiative to improve competency performing nasopharyngeal swabs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-one health care workers attended teaching sessions led by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology on proper nasopharyngeal swab technique. After a brief lecture, participants practiced their swab technique using a high-fidelity airway simulation model. Pre- and postintervention self-evaluations were measured via standardized clinical competency questionnaires on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “No knowledge, unable to perform” up to “Highly knowledgeable and confident, independent.” Results: Forty-six participants in this study submitted pre- and postintervention self-assessments. Postintervention scores improved on average 1.41 points (95% CI, 1.10-1.73) out of 5 from a mean score of 3.13 to 4.54 (P <.0001). This reflects a large effect size with a Glass’s delta value of 1.3. Discussion: Lecture coupled with simulation-based teaching can significantly improve health care workers’ confidence in performing nasopharyngeal swabs. Proper training for frontline workers performing swabs for COVID-19 is essential to improving testing accuracy and can be achieved in a simple and timely manner. Implications for Practice: To meet the testing needs of the growing pandemic, many health care workers who are unfamiliar with nasopharyngeal swabs have been asked to perform this test. Simulation-based teaching sessions may improve health care workers’ confidence and help prevent false-negative results. This intervention is easily reproducible in any setting where frequent nasopharyngeal swab testing occurs.

We report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. Methods: To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health's online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). Results: Compared with other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To increase our understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we divided the period into 4 phases: phase 1 (when there were confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases in Yogyakarta), phase 2 (when the first case in Yogyakarta was detected), phase 3 (when the cumulative cases surpass their peak), and phase 4 (when the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 per week. Conclusions: A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Low- and middle-income countries; Neurosurgery service; Pandemic",,"32442732","World Neurosurg.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086102890

Multiple triage systems for nonemergent surgical procedures have been published, but potentially curative cancer procedures are essential surgery rather than elective surgery. In the present and future scenario of our country, thoracic oncology teams may have the difficult decision of weighing the utility of surgical intervention against the risk for inadvertent COVID-19 exposure for patients and medical staff. In consequence, traditional pathways of surgical care must be adjusted to reduce the risk of infection and the use of resources. It is recommended that all thoracic cancer patients should be offered treatment according to the accepted standard of care until shortage of services require a progressive reduction in surgical cases. Here, we present a consensus of recommendations discussed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts on thoracic oncology and based on the best available evidence, and hope it will provide a modifiable framework of guidance for local strategy planners in thoracic cancer care services in Mexico. Key points: Significant findings of the study: This article provides recommendations to guarantee the continuity of surgical care for thoracic oncology cases during COVID-19 pandemic, whilst maintaining the safety of patients and medical staff.

Methods: We used a panel of 167 samples (77 pre-epidemic and 90 COVID-19 seroconverters) and SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV Spike and/or Nucleopcapsid (NC) proteins to develop a high throughput multiplex screening assay to detect IgG antibodies in human plasma. Assay performances were determined by ROC curves analysis. A subset of the COVID-19+ samples (n = 36) were also tested by a commercial NC-based ELISA test and the results compared with those of the novel assay. Results: On samples collected ≥14 days after symptoms onset, the accuracy of the assay is 100 % (95 % CI: 100−100) for the Spike antigen and 99.9 % (95 % CI:99.7−100) for NC. By logistic regression, we estimated that 50 % of the patients have seroconverted at 5.7 ± 1.6; 5.7 ± 1.8 and 7.9 ± 1.0 days after symptoms onset against Spike, NC or both antigens, respectively and all have seroconverted two weeks after symptoms onset. IgG titration in a subset of samples showed that early phase samples present lower IgG titers than those from later phase. IgG to SARS-CoV2 NC cross-reacted at 100 % with SARS-CoV1 NC. Twenty-nine of the 36 (80.5 %) samples tested were positive by the commercial ELISA while 31/36 (86.1 %) were positive by the novel assay. Conclusions: Our assay is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 proteins, suitable for high throughput epidemiological surveys. The novel assay is more sensitive than a commercial ELISA. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Luminex; SARS; SARS-CoV2; Serology","coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; nucleocapsid protein; virus antibody; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; nucleocapsid protein; virus antibody; virus antigen; adult; aged; antibody detection; antibody screening; antibody titer; Article; blood sampling; cohort analysis; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; enzyme immunoassay; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; SARS coronavirus; sensitivity and specificity; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus titration; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; immunology; middle aged; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pandemic; procedures; SARS coronavirus; serology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; time factor; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Nucleocapsid Proteins; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; ROC Curve; SARS Virus; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Time Factors","32623350","J.

Method: We searched PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. We selected randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, and research letters of children ages birth to 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to calculate the weighted mean prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) or the weighted average means and 95% CI. Result: Forty-six articles reporting 551 cases of COVID-19 in children (aged 1 day-17.5 years) were included. Eighty-seven percent (95% CI: 77%-95%) of patients had household exposure to COVID-19. The most common symptoms and signs were fever (53%, 95% CI: 45%-61%), cough (39%, 95% CI: 30%-47%), and sore throat/pharyngeal erythema (14%, 95% CI: 4%-28%); however, 18% (95% CI: 11%-27%) of cases were asymptomatic. The most common radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings were patchy consolidations (33%, 95% CI: 23%-43%) and ground glass opacities (28%, 95% CI: 18%-39%), but 36% (95% CI: 28%-45%) of patients had normal CT images. Antiviral agents were given to 74% of patients (95% CI: 52%-92%). Six patients, all with major underlying medical conditions, needed invasive mechanical ventilation, and one of them died. Conclusion: Previously healthy children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. The diagnosis is generally suspected from history of household exposure to COVID-19 case. Children with COVID-19 and major underlying condition are more likely to have severe/critical disease and poor prognosis, even death. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; CT; meta-analysis; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signs; symptoms","acetylsalicylic acid; alpha1 interferon; alpha2b interferon; amikacin; amoxicillin; antibiotic agent; azithromycin; ceftazidime; glucocorticoid; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; methylprednisolone; montelukast; moxifloxacin; oseltamivir; oxygen; penicillin G; peramivir; ribavirin; vancomycin; antivirus agent; Article; artificial ventilation; asymptomatic disease; attitude to health; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease severity; environmental exposure; fever; ground glass opacity; human; laboratory test; lung lesion; meta analysis (topic); mortality rate; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; pediatric patient; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); renal replacement therapy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; systematic review; thorax radiography; adolescent; adverse event; asymptomatic infection; Betacoronavirus; child; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diagnostic imaging; erythema; female; fever; infant; meta analysis; mortality; newborn; observational study; pandemic; pharyngitis; preschool child; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Infections; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Erythema; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Observational Studies as Topic; Pandemics; Pharyngitis; Pneumonia, Viral; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiration, Artificial; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32519809","Pediatr.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey among young adults with T1DM (aged 18–30 years) in the North, Central, South, and West zones of India. It consisted of fifteen, five and eight questions pertaining to knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19, respectively. Certain questions relevant to T1DM were also incorporated. Results: After exclusion, 212 participants were included (mean age = 25.1 ± 4.3 years; M:F = 10:11). The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 83% (mean total knowledge score = 12.4 ± 1.9). Most (74%) had an average knowledge score (mean ± 1SD). Higher educational status, urban residence, and being married were associated with better knowledge scores; however, only urban residence was found to be statistically significant on multinomial logistic regression. Most (88%) felt that being a patient of T1DM, they were at higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19. At the same time, 98% were confident about self-protection. Fifty-one percent of respondents had left home amid lockdown mostly to procure insulin/injection needles/syringes/glucometer strips from the pharmacy. However, all were maintaining proper hand hygiene and majority were following routine dietary advice (95%) and administering prescribed insulin doses (99%).

Several improvements have been made, including discovery of the clinical efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) in patients with COVID-19, but effective treatment protocols remain elusive. In the search for novel treatment options, many scientists have used the in-silico approach to identify compounds that could interfere with the key molecules involved in entrance, replication or dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, most of the identified molecules are not available as pharmacological agents at present, and assessment of their safety and efficacy could take many months. This review took a different approach based on the proposed pharmacodynamic model of CQ in COVID-19. The main mechanism of action responsible for the favourable outcome of patients with COVID-19 treated with CQ seems to be related to a pH-modulation-mediated effect on endolysosomal trafficking, a characteristic of chemical compounds often called ‘lysosomotropic agents’ because of the physico-chemical properties that enable them to diffuse passively through the endosomal membrane and undergo protonation-based trapping in the lumen of the acidic vesicles. This review discusses lysosomotropic and lysosome targeting drugs that are already in clinical use and are characterized by good safety profiles, low cost and wide availability. Some of these drugs –particularly azithromycin and other macrolides, indomethacin and some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and fluoxetine – could provide additional therapeutic benefits in addition to the potential antiviral effect that is still to be confirmed by well-controlled clinical trials. As some of these drugs have probably been used empirically in the treatment of COVID-19, it is hoped that colleagues worldwide will publish patient data to enable evaluation of the potential efficacy of these agents in the clinical context, and rapid implementation in therapeutic protocols if they are shown to have a beneficial effect on clinical outcome. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral; COVID-19; Drug repurposing; Endosome; Lysosomotropic agents","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; fluoxetine; fluvoxamine; indometacin; lansoprazole; macrolide; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; omeprazole; proton pump inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; antiviral activity; Article; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug targeting; endosome; human; lysosome; physical chemistry; priority journal; quarantine; social isolation; viral tropism; virus replication","32522674","Int.

We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, LILACS and CINAHL for eligible studies published from 1 January 2020 to 17 April 2020. We included patients of all ages, in all settings. The main outcome was the proportion of patients with a bacterial, fungal or viral co-infection. Results: Thirty studies including 3834 patients were included. Overall, 7% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a bacterial co-infection (95% CI 3-12%, n=2183, I2=92·2%). A higher proportion of ICU patients had bacterial co-infections than patients in mixed ward/ICU settings (14%, 95% CI 5-26, I2=74·7% versus 4%, 95% CI 1-9, I2= 91·7%). The commonest bacteria were Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. The pooled proportion with a viral co-infection was 3% (95% CI 1-6, n=1014, I2=62·3%), with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and influenza A the commonest. Three studies reported fungal co-infections. Conclusions: A low proportion of COVID-19 patients have a bacterial co-infection; less than in previous influenza pandemics.

Countries around the globe are facing chal lenges with diabetes care and are similarly adapting care delivery, with local cultural nuances. People with diabete s suffer disproportionately from acute COVID-19 with higher rates of serious complications and death. In-patient ser vices need specialist support to appropriately manage glycaemia in people with known and undiagnosed diabetes present ing with COVID-19. Due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, people with diabetes may suffer longer-term har m caused by inadequate clinical support and less frequent monitoring of their condition and diabetes-relate d complications. Outpatient management need to be reorganised to maintain remote advice and support services, focusing on proactive care for the highest risk, and using telehealth and digital services for consultations, self-m anagement and remote monitoring, where appropriate. Stratification of patients for face-to-face or remote follow-up should be based on a balanced risk assessment. Public health and national organisations have generally responded rapi dly with guidance on care management, but the pandemic has created a tension around prioritisation of communi cable vs non-communicable disease. Resulting challenges in clinical decision-making are compounded by a redu ced clinical workforce. For many years, increasing diabetes mellitus incidence has been mirrored by rising prevent able morbidity and mortality due to complications, yet innovation in service delivery has been slow. While the cur rent focus is on limiting the terrible harm caused by the pandemic, it is possible that a positive lasting legacy of COVID-19 might include accelerated innovation in chronic disease management. © 2020 BioScientifica Ltd..

We studied the clinical characteristics and therapies of severe cases in Jiangsu Province. Methods: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze clinical, laboratory data and treatment of 60 severe cases with COVID-19 infection in Jiangsu Province between January 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The improvement and deterioration subgroups were compared to identify predictors of disease progression. Results: A total of 653 infected cases with COVID-19 were reported in Jiangsu Province, of which 60 severe cases were included in this study. Up until April 20, 2020, the mortality of severe patients was 0%. The median age was 57 years. The average body mass index of these patients was 25 kg/m². White blood cell counts decreased in 45.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 63.3%, thrombocytopenia in 13.3% and procalcitonin levels in 88.3% of the patients were less than 0.5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and GCs therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups. Logistic regression analysis identified higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.08; P = 0.04), antiviral therapy with aerosol inhalation of interferon (OR: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.18-33.98; P = 0.03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.17-3.41; P = 0.01) as predictors of disease progression, whereas higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.57; P = 0.01) and early prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.98; P = 0.04). Conclusions: COVID-19 infection had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. The higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count were predictors of disease progression.

Patients (n = 25) with severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28, 2020, to April 14, 2020. Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma, obtained from donors with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who had recovered. The primary study outcome was safety, and the secondary outcome was clinical status at day 14 after transfusion. Clinical improvement was assessed on the basis of a modified World Health Organization six-point ordinal scale and laboratory parameters. Viral genome sequencing was performed on donor and recipient strains. At day 7 after transfusion with convalescent plasma, nine patients had at least a one-point improvement in clinical scale, and seven of those were discharged. By day 14 after transfusion, 19 (76%) patients had at least a one-point improvement in clinical status, and 11 were discharged. No adverse events as a result of plasma transfusion were observed. Whole genome sequencing data did not identify a strain genotype-disease severity correlation.

This infodemic also included sensational and distorted information about drugs that likely first influenced opinion leaders and people particularly active on social media and then other people, thus affecting choices by individual patients everywhere. In particular, information has spread about some drugs approved for other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, favipiravir, and umifenovir) that could have led to inappropriate and therefore hazardous use. In this article, we analyze the rationale behind the claims for use of these drugs in COVID-19, the communication about their effects on the disease, the consequences of this communication on people’s behavior, and the responses of some influential regulatory authorities in an attempt to minimize the actual or potential risks arising from this behavior.

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. Methods: Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). Results: In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were three deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and one serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. Conclusion: Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cytokine; Intensive care; Tocilizumab","antimalarial agent; antivirus agent; C reactive protein; creatine kinase; D dimer; glucocorticoid; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; tocilizumab; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; glucocorticoid; immunologic factor; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; adult; age; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; assisted ventilation; B lymphocyte; bacterial superinfection; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD8 lymphocyte count; Charlson Comorbidity Index; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; creatine kinase blood level; cytokine storm; female; follow up; gender; hospital patient; human; hypertension; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; length of stay; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; natural killer cell; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; platelet count; pneumonia; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment failure; aged; complication; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; health care quality; hospital; Italy; pandemic; treatment outcome; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antiviral Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Female; Glucocorticoids; Hospitals; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Inpatients; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Standard of Care; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","32425662","J.

Application scenarios are several, and they spread from simple clinical assisting scenarios to an emergency one. For instance, in the case of a nursing home, the system would support in continuously monitoring the elderly patients. In contrast, in the case of an epidemic diffusion, such as COVID-19 pandemic, the system may help in all the early triage phases, significantly reducing the risk of contagion. However, the system has to let medical assistants perform actions remotely such as changing therapies or interacting with patients that need support.

Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV–I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions.

Case Description: We report the case of a 65-year-old man who had presented with epistaxis and serous rhinorrhea. When he had fallen to the ground near his bee boxes, a garden pole had poked into his right nostril. He had instantly removed the pole from his nostril himself. However, immediately after removal of the pole, he had developed nasal bleeding and serous rhinorrhea. He then drove to our emergency room. Computed tomography showed pneumocephalus with a minor cerebral contusion in the left frontal lobe and a penetrating injury in the left anterior skull base. His CSF leakage had not resolve spontaneously within 1 week after the injury with strict bed rest. We repaired the CSF leakage using a fat (adipose tissue)-on-fascia autograft plug and caulked the defect in the anterior skull base with the fat-on-fascia graft (FFG) plug through the left nostril with endoscopic guidance. The CSF rhinorrhea was successfully controlled. Intranasal local application of fluorescein aided in the detection of the direction of flow of the CSF leakage. Conclusions: Endonasal endoscopic caulking of a skull base defect using an FFG plug can be useful to treat CSF leakage due to the localized skull base defect, especially in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. It is simple, inexpensive, and timesaving. It requires no special skills nor sophisticated instruments that can cause aerosolization, reducing the risk of infection during the surgery. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebrospinal fluid leakage; COVID-19 era; Endonasal endoscopic repair; Fat-on-fascia graft; Fluorescein; Skull base defect; Traumatic nonmissile penetrating transnasal skull base fracture","piperacillin; adipose tissue; aged; Article; bed rest; body height; body mass; body weight; brain contusion; brain injury; case report; cerebrospinal fluid drainage; cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea; clinical article; conservative treatment; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency ward; epistaxis; ethmoid sinus; fascia; follow up; frontal lobe; human; image reconstruction; liquorrhea; male; medical history; nose septum; paresthesia; penetrating trauma; pneumocephalus; rhinorrhea; sinusitis; skull base; skull base fracture; traumatic nonmissile penetrating transnasal anterior skull base fracture; x-ray computed tomography","32497852","World Neurosurg.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086435491

SUMMARY ANSWER: Two PIs, lopinavir and darunavir, currently offered as cART options in HIV-positive pregnancies were evaluated, and we found that lopinavir-based cART, but not darunavir-based cART, impaired uterine decidualization and spiral artery remodeling in both human ex vivo and mouse in vivo experimental models. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Early initiation of cART is recommended for pregnant women living with HIV. However, poor birth outcomes are frequently observed in HIV-positive pregnancies exposed to PI-based cART, especially when it is initiated prior to conception. The correlation between early initiation of PI-cART and adverse birth outcomes is poorly understood, due to lack of data on the specific effects of PI-cART on the early stages of pregnancy involving uterine decidualization and spiral artery remodeling. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Lopinavir and darunavir were evaluated in clinically relevant combinations using an ex vivo human first-trimester placenta-decidua explant model, an in vitro human primary decidual cell culture system, and an in vivo mouse pregnancy model. The first-trimester (gestational age, 6-8 weeks) human placenta-decidua tissue was obtained from 11 to 15 healthy women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy. C57Bl/6 female mice (four/treatment group) were administered either lopinavir-cART, darunavir-cART or water by oral gavage once daily starting on the day of plug detection until sacrifice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human: Spiral artery remodeling was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of first-trimester placenta-decidua explant co-culture system. Trophoblast migration was measured using a placental explant culture. A primary decidual cell culture was used to evaluate the viability of immune cell populations by flow cytometry. Soluble factors, including biomarkers of decidualization and angiogenesis, were quantified by ELISA and Luminex assay using decidua-conditioned media. Mouse: In the mouse pregnancy model, gestational day 6.5 or 9.5 implantation sites were used to assess decidualization, spiral artery remodeling and uterine natural killer (uNK) cell numbers by immunohistochemistry. Transcription factor STAT3 was assayed by immunohistochemistry in both human decidua and mouse implantation sites. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Lopinavir-cART, but not darunavir-cART, impaired uterine decidualization and spiral artery remodeling in both experimental models. Lopinavir-cART treatment was also associated with selective depletion of uNK cells, reduced trophoblast migration and defective placentation. The lopinavir-associated decidualization defects were attributed to a decrease in expression of transcription factor STAT3, known to regulate decidualization. Our results suggest that periconceptional initiation of lopinavir-cART, but not darunavir-cART, causes defective maturation of the uterine endometrium, leading to impairments in spiral artery remodeling and placentation, thus contributing to the poor birth outcomes.N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The human first-trimester placenta/decidua samples could only be obtained from healthy females undergoing elective termination of pregnancy. As biopsy is the only way to obtain first-trimester decidua from pregnant women living with HIV on PI-cART, ethics approval and participant consent are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, our animal model is limited to the study of cART and does not include HIV. HIV infection is also associated with immune dysregulation, inflammation, alterations in angiogenic factors and complement activation, all of which could influence decidual and placental vascular remodeling and modify any cART effects. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings provide mechanistic insight with direct clinical implications, rationalizing why the highest adverse birth outcomes are reported in HIV-positive pregnancies exposed to lopinavir-cART from conception. We demonstrate that dysregulation of decidualization is the mechanism through which lopinavir-cART, but not darunavir-cART, use in early pregnancy leads to poor birth outcomes. Although lopinavir is no longer a first-line regimen in pregnancy, it remains an alternate regimen and is often the only PI available in low resource settings. Our results highlight the need for reconsidering current guidelines recommending lopinavir use in pregnancy and indicate that lopinavir should be avoided especially in the first trimester, whereas darunavir is safe to use and should be the preferred PI in pregnancy.Further, in current times of the COVID-19 pandemic, lopinavir is among the top drug candidates which are being repurposed for inclusion in clinical trials world-over, to assess their therapeutic potential against the dangerous respiratory disease. Current trials are also testing the efficacy of lopinavir given prophylactically to protect health care workers and people with potential exposures. Given the current extraordinary numbers, these might include women with early pregnancies, who may or may not be cognizant of their gestational status. This is a matter of concern as it could mean that women with early pregnancies might be exposed to this drug, which can cause decidualization defects. Our findings provide evidence of safety concerns surrounding lopinavir use in pregnancy, that women of reproductive age considering participation in such trials should be made aware of, so they can make a fully informed decision.

In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective: This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results: Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion: Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; perinatal anxiety; perinatal depression","antenatal depression; anxiety disorder; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; epidemic; female; human; mental health; middle income group; pregnant woman; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; third trimester pregnancy; underweight; adult; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; depression; epidemic; multicenter study; pandemic; pregnancy; psychology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women","32437665","Am.

Although he had fever and odynophagia, no abnormalities were observed in his nasopharyngeal mucosa, suggesting that his anosmia resulted from olfactory neuropathy. DIAGNOSES: COVID-19 was confirmed by RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab specimen. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received olfactory training and B complex vitamins. OUTCOMES: On day 30, the patient reported complete recovery of his sense of smell.

Relatively little attention has been paid to understanding how the pandemic has affected treatment, prevention and control of malaria, which is a major cause of death and disease and predominantly affects people in less well-resourced settings. MAIN BODY: Recent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the global malaria burden, but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 5 years. Withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence, primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women. Malaria programmes are being affected in many ways by COVID-19. For prevention of malaria, insecticide-treated nets need regular renewal, but distribution campaigns have been delayed or cancelled. For detection and treatment of malaria, individuals may stop attending health facilities, out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, or because they cannot afford transport, and health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from COVID-19. Supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted, which is compounded by production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics. These disruptions are predicted to double the number of young African children dying of malaria in the coming year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance. Using examples from successful malaria control and elimination campaigns, we propose strategies to re-establish malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be a long-term challenge. All sectors of society, including governments, donors, private sector and civil society organisations, have crucial roles to play to prevent malaria resurgence. Sparse resources must be allocated efficiently to ensure integrated health care systems that can sustain control activities against COVID-19 as well as malaria and other priority infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: As we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that other major killers such as malaria are not ignored. History tells us that if we do, the consequences will be dire, particularly in vulnerable populations.","COVID-19; Drug resistance; Elimination; Malaria; Plasmodium",,"32727467","BMC Med",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088850996

Internet browsing data may predict case outbreaks in local populations that are yet to be confirmed. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether search-engine query patterns can help to predict COVID-19 case rates at the state and metropolitan area levels in the United States. METHODS: We used regional confirmed case data from the New York Times and Google Trends results from 50 states and 166 county-based designated market areas (DMA). We identified search terms whose activity precedes and correlates with confirmed case rates at the national level. We used univariate regression to construct a composite explanatory variable based on best-fitting search queries offset by temporal lags. We measured the raw and z-transformed Pearson correlation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the explanatory variable with out-of-sample case rate data at the state and DMA levels. RESULTS: Predictions were highly correlated with confirmed case rates at the state (mean r=0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.81; median RMSE 1.27, IQR 1.48) and DMA levels (mean r=0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.61; median RMSE 4.38, IQR 1.80), using search data available up to 10 days prior to confirmed case rates. They fit case-rate activity in 49 of 50 states and in 103 of 166 DMA at a significance level of .05. CONCLUSIONS: Identifiable patterns in search query activity may help to predict emerging regional outbreaks of COVID-19, although they remain vulnerable to stochastic changes in search intensity. ©Henry C Cousins, Clara C Cousins, Alon Harris, Louis R Pasquale.

However, limited test availability, high false-negative rates, and the existence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections have resulted in an undercounting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be used to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. We found a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average in March 2020 and showed that this surge correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts across states. If one-third of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States sought care, this ILI surge would have corresponded to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the United States during the 3-week period from 8 to 28 March 2020. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the United States, we also show that the early epidemic in the United States was unlikely to have been doubling slower than every 4 days. Together, these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States characterized by rapid spread across the United States with more than 80% infected individuals remaining undetected. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic surveillance for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.

Trial design: Adaptive (group-sequential), parallel group, pragmatic, superiority randomised controlled, open-label, multi-centre, effectiveness trial. Participants: The trial is being conducted across approximately 60 hospitals across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Inpatients at participating hospitals are eligible to participate if they have respiratory failure with suspected or proven COVID-19, and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: 1) Adults ≥ 18 years; 2) Admitted to hospital with suspected or proven COVID-19; 3) Receiving oxygen with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≥0.4 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94%; and 4) Plan for escalation to tracheal intubation if needed. Exclusion criteria: 1) Planned tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation imminent within 1 hour; 2) Known or clinically apparent pregnancy; 3) Any absolute contraindication to CPAP or HFNO; 4) Decision not to intubate due to ceiling of treatment or withdrawal of treatment anticipated; and 5) Equipment for both CPAP and HFNO not available. Intervention and comparator: Intervention one: Continuous positive airway pressure delivered by any device. Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Intervention two: High-flow nasal oxygen delivered by any device. Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Comparator group: Standard care-oxygen delivered by face mask or nasal cannula (excluding the use of continuous positive airway pressure or high-flow nasal oxygen). Set-up and therapy titration is not protocolised and is delivered in accordance with clinical discretion. Intervention delivery continues up to the point of death, tracheal intubation, or clinical determination that there is no ongoing need (palliation or improvement). Main outcomes: The primary outcome is a composite outcome comprising tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days following randomisation. Secondary outcomes include tracheal intubation rate, time to tracheal intubation, duration of invasive ventilation, mortality rate, time to mortality, length of hospital stay, and length of critical care stay. Randomisation: Participants are randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either continuous positive airway pressure, high-flow nasal oxygen or standard care. Due to the challenging environment of study delivery, a specific intervention may not always be available at the hospital site. The study uses two integrated randomisation systems to allow, where required, the site to randomise between all three interventions, between CPAP and standard care, and between HFNO and standard care. System integration ensures maintenance of balance between interventions. Randomisation is performed using a telephone-based interactive voice response system to maintain allocation concealment. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated using the minimisation method. Participant randomisation is stratified by site, gender (M/F), and age (<50, >=50 years). Blinding (masking): The nature of the trial interventions precludes blinding of the researcher, patient and clinical team. Primary and secondary outcomes are all objective outcomes, thereby minimising the risk of detection bias.

Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding. METHODS: In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from 2 hospitals outside Wuhan. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 (13-22) days as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (<15 days) and late (≥15 days after illness onset) viral RNA clearance, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (P = .009), old age (P = .033), concomitant hypertension (P = .009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (P = .001), severe illness at admission (P = .049), invasive mechanical ventilation (P = .006), and corticosteroid treatment (P = .025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (P < .001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (P < .001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Male sex (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.31-8.02), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.54), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88; 95% CI, 1.11-88.02) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Hospital admission and general treatments should be started as soon as possible in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially male patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

We wanted to rapidly characterise the transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape of this novel coronavirus to provide a fundamental description of the virus's genomic and proteomic potential. Methods: We used direct RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells which is widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. Allied to this, we used tandem mass spectrometry to investigate the proteome and phosphoproteome of the same virally infected cells. Results: Our integrated analysis revealed that the viral transcripts (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs) generally fitted the expected transcription model for coronaviruses. Importantly, a 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in over half of the subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. Tandem mass spectrometry identified over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides in virus-infected cells, covering almost all proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Conclusions: Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein, a leading vaccine target, shows that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. The furin site directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit and likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. Our data emphasises that the viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"coronavirus spike glycoprotein; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; animal; Betacoronavirus; Chlorocebus aethiops; gene deletion; gene expression profiling; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phosphorylation; procedures; proteomics; sequence analysis; tandem mass spectrometry; Vero cell line; virus culture; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Chlorocebus aethiops; Gene Expression Profiling; Phosphorylation; Proteomics; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sequence Deletion; Serial Passage; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Vero Cells","32723359","Genome Med.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088880494

The incubation period for the virus is ~1–14 days and all age groups may be susceptible to a fatality rate of about 5.9%. COVID-19 is caused by a novel single-stranded, positive (+) sense RNA beta coronavirus. The development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent need worldwide. Immunoinformatics approaches are both cost-effective and convenient, as in silico predictions can reduce the number of experiments needed. In this study, with the aid of immunoinformatics tools, we tried to design a multi-epitope vaccine that can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The epitopes were computed by using B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and helper T lymphocytes (HTL) base on the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. A vaccine was devised by fusing together the B cell, HTL, and CTL epitopes with linkers. To enhance the immunogenicity, the β-defensin (45 mer) amino acid sequence, and pan-HLA DR binding epitopes (13aa) were adjoined to the N-terminal of the vaccine with the help of the EAAAK linker. To enable the intracellular delivery of the modeled vaccine, a TAT sequence (11aa) was appended to C-terminal. Linkers play vital roles in producing an extended conformation (flexibility), protein folding, and separation of functional domains, and therefore, make the protein structure more stable. The secondary and three-dimensional (3D) structure of the final vaccine was then predicted. Furthermore, the complex between the final vaccine and immune receptors (toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3), major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), and MHC-II) were evaluated by molecular docking. Lastly, to confirm the expression of the designed vaccine, the mRNA of the vaccine was enhanced with the aid of the Java Codon Adaptation Tool, and the secondary structure was generated from Mfold. Then we performed in silico cloning. The final vaccine requires experimental validation to determine its safety and efficacy in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections. © Copyright © 2020 Dong, Chu, Yu and Zha.","COVID-19; epitope prediction; immunoinformatics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine",,,"Front.

The current method of detection involves a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False-negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, including IgA, IgM, and IgG response, was examined by using an ELISA-based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but with typical manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort. RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection was 5 (IQR, 3-6) days, while IgG was detected 14 (IQR, 10-18) days after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR after 5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combining IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compared with a single qPCR test (51.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases. © The Author(s) 2020.

The widely used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based 2 target genes (ORF1ab and N). Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging. RESULTS: In 95 samples that tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy number of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87). Four (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral loads ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test. The viral load of respiratory samples was then compared and the average viral load in sputum (17 429 ± 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 ± 1965 copies/test, P < .001) and nasal swabs (651 ± 501 copies/test, P < .001). Furthermore, the viral loads in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46 800 ± 17 272 vs 1252 ± 1027, P < .001) analyzed by sputum samples.

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells. The S proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced reference Betacoronaviruses, complemented with functional and structural analyses. This analysis reveals that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant cluster shared by SARS and SARS-CoV-2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, namely an ion-channel, and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM). These features play a key role in the activation of the inflammasome causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the leading cause of death in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together with functional pangenomic analysis, mutation tracking, and previous evidence, on E protein as a determinant of pathogenicity in SARS, we suggest E protein as an alternative therapeutic target to be considered for further studies to reduce complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections in COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Alam, Kamau, Kulmanov, Jaremko, Arold, Pain, Gojobori and Duarte.","ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome); COVID-19; E protein Inhibitors; envelope protein (E); SARS-CoV-2; therapeutic targets",,,"Front.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In China, the pandemic was controlled after 2 mo through effective policies and containment measures. Describing the detailed policies and containment measures used to control the epidemic in Chongqing will provide a reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in other areas of the world. AIM To explore the effects of different policies and containment measures on the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing. METHODS Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Chongqing were prospectively collected from January 21 to March 15, 2020. The policies and prevention measures implemented by the government during the epidemic period were also collected. Trend analysis was performed to explore the impact of the main policy measures on the effectiveness of the control of COVID-19 in Chongqing. RESULTS As of March 15, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Chongqing was 1.84/100000 (576 cases) and the infection fatality rate was 1.04% (6/576). The spread of COVID-19 was controlled by effective policies that involved establishing a group for directing the COVID-19 epidemic control effort; strengthening guidance and supervision; ensuring the supply of daily necessities and medical supplies and equipment to residents; setting up designated hospitals; implementing legal measures; and enhancing health education. Medical techniques were implemented to improve the recovery rate and control the epidemic. Policies such as ""the lockdown of Wuhan"", ""initiating a first-level response to major public health emergencies"", and ""implementing the closed management of residential communities"" significantly curbed the spread of COVID-19. Optimizing the diagnosis process, shortening the diagnosis time, and constructing teams of clinical experts facilitated the provision of ""one team of medical experts for each patient"" treatment for severe patients, which significantly improved the recovery rate and reduced the infection fatality rate. CONCLUSION The prevention policies and containment measures implemented by the government and medical institutions are highly effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic and increasing the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients. © The Author(s) 2020.","Containment measures; Control effectiveness; COVID-19; Epidemic trend; Prevention policies; Public health",,,"World J.

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 and necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom 689 excess serum specimens were available and found that sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested specimens from 4,856 individuals from Boise, ID, collected over 1 week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect that the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.

Volatile organic compounds produced during respiratory infections can cause specific scent imprints, which can be detected by trained dogs with a high rate of precision. Methods: Eight detection dogs were trained for 1 week to detect saliva or tracheobronchial secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a randomised, double-blinded and controlled study. Results: The dogs were able to discriminate between samples of infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) individuals with average diagnostic sensitivity of 82.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.02-83.24%) and specificity of 96.35% (95% CI: 96.31-96.39%). During the presentation of 1012 randomised samples, the dogs achieved an overall average detection rate of 94% (±3.4%) with 157 correct indications of positive, 792 correct rejections of negative, 33 incorrect indications of negative or incorrect rejections of 30 positive sample presentations. Conclusions: These preliminary findings indicate that trained detection dogs can identify respiratory secretion samples from hospitalised and clinically diseased SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals by discriminating between samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and negative controls. This data may form the basis for the reliable screening method of SARS-CoV-2 infected people. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Olfactory detection; Saliva; SARS-CoV-2; Scent detection dogs; Volatile organic compounds","Article; bronchus secretion; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; detection dog; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; double blind procedure; false positive result; hospital patient; human; nonhuman; pilot study; predictive value; randomized controlled trial; reliability; saliva; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal; Betacoronavirus; bronchus; case control study; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; dog; isolation and purification; mass screening; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; fragrance; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Bronchi; Case-Control Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Dogs; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Mass Screening; Odorants; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Saliva; Sensitivity and Specificity","32703188","BMC Infect.

Many commercial SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays have received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, there are limited data describing their performance, in particular the performance of high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR systems. We analyzed the diagnostic performance of two high-throughput systems: cobas 6800 and Panther Fusion, and their associated RT-PCR assays, with a collection of 389 nasopharyngeal specimens. The overall agreement between the platforms was 96.4% (375/389). Cohen's kappa analysis rated the strength of agreement between the two platforms as ""almost perfect"" (κ = 0.922; standard error, 0.051). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between corresponding cycle threshold values generated on the two systems (P value = 0.88; Student's t test). Taken together, these data imply that the two platforms can be considered comparable in terms of their clinical performance. We believe that this information will be useful for those who have already adopted these platforms or are seeking to implement high-throughput RT-PCR testing to stem the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

However, this fraction depends heavily on the sampling intensity and the various test criteria used in different jurisdictions, and many sources indicate that a large fraction of cases tend to go undetected. Methods: Estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population can be made by random sampling and pooling of RT-PCR tests. Here I use simulations to explore how experiment sample size and degrees of sample pooling impact precision of prevalence estimates and potential for minimizing the total number of tests required to get individual-level diagnostic results. Results: Sample pooling can greatly reduce the total number of tests required for prevalence estimation. In low-prevalence populations, it is theoretically possible to pool hundreds of samples with only marginal loss of precision. Even when the true prevalence is as high as 10% it can be appropriate to pool up to 15 samples. Sample pooling can be particularly beneficial when the test has imperfect specificity by providing more accurate estimates of the prevalence than an equal number of individual-level tests. Conclusion: Sample pooling should be considered in COVID-19 prevalence estimation efforts. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"algorithm; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic test; genetics; health survey; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; prevalence; procedures; reproducibility; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sample size; sensitivity and specificity; specimen handling; virology; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sample Size; Sensitivity and Specificity; Specimen Handling","32703158","BMC Med.

As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19.

However, few studies have investigated the mental health of parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims To investigate the depression, anxiety and stress of the students' parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the influence factors, especially the influence of social support and family-related factors. Methods The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Perceived Stress Scale-10 and Social Support Rating Scale were applied to 1163 parents to measure the parents' depression, anxiety, stress and social support. Results (1) The detection rates of depression and anxiety in parents were 6.1% and 4.0%. The depression, anxiety and perceived stress of parents in central China were significantly higher than those in non-central China. The anxiety of college students' parents was lower than that of parents of the primary, middle and high school students. The depression, anxiety and perceived stress of parents with conflicts in the family were significantly higher than those with a harmonious family. Other factors that influence parents' depression, anxiety and perceived stress include marital satisfaction, social support, parents' history of mental illness and parenting style, etc. (2) The regression analysis results showed that perceived stress, social support, marital satisfaction, family conflicts, child's learning stage as well as parents' history of mental illness had significant effects on parents' anxiety and depression. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of parents was affected by a variety of factors. Good marital relationships, good social support, family harmony and parents without a history of mental illness may be protective factors for parents' mental health, while perceived stress and child in middle or high school are risk factors for parents' mental health. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Recent epidemiological models show that, without effective treatment or vaccine, there will be a long-lasting phase of cohabitation with the virus. Current experts' opinions recommend performing only non-deferrable uro-oncological surgery and postponing other activities until the end of the emergency, with particular concerns regarding the safety laparoscopy. Veneto Region and Padua Province represent one of the first site of the pandemic spread of the virus outside China, thus we present our experience as a Urological Referral Center in applying a segregated-team work model of organization during the month of March 2020, with a stratified organization of activities, adequate screening and protection for patients and staff were adopted. Compared to the same period of last year even if a 19.5% reduction was experienced in overall surgical activity while maintaining a comparable proportion of oncologic robotic and laparoscopic surgery and guaranteeing care also for high priority non-oncological patients. No cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in staff members nor in patients and the number of surgical complications was comparable to that of last year. Therefore, in our opinion the recommended significant reduction in urological care, including surgical activities, is likely unrealistic in the long period with unknown effects affecting mostly oncological patients. Our experience introducing a segregated-team work model might represent a model for future planning. © Copyright © 2020 Prayer-Galetti, Motterle, Morlacco, Celso, Boemo, Iafrate and Zattoni.","COVID-19; management; organization; surgery; urology",,,"Front.

Methods A model that consisted of six compartments was built. The compartments were the susceptible (S), the asymptomatic infective (A), the presymptomatic infective (L), the symptomatic infective (I), the recovered (R), and the deceased (D). The A, L and I classes were infective states. To construct the model, several parameters were set as fixed using existing evidence and the rest of the parameters were estimated by fitting the model to a smoothed curve of the cumulative confirmed cases in Wuhan from 24 January 2020 to 6 March 2020. Input data about the cost-effectiveness analysis were retrieved from the literature. Results Conducting RT-PCR tests three times for diagnosing and discharging people with COVID-19 reduced the estimated total number of symptomatic cases to 45 013 from 51 144 in the two-test strategy over 43 days. The former strategy also led to 850.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of health gain and a net healthcare expenditure saving of CN¥49.1 million. About 100.7 QALYs of the health gain were attributable to quality-adjusted life day difference between the strategies during the analytic period and 749.4 QALYs were attributable to years of life saved. Conclusions More accurate strategies and methods of testing for the control of COVID-19 may reduce both the number of infections and the total medical costs. Increasing the number of tests should be considered in regions with relatively severe epidemics when existing tests have moderate sensitivity. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

To determine whether local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducted deidentified sentinel surveillance at six NYC hospital emergency departments (EDs) during March 1-20. On March 8, while testing availability for SARS-CoV-2 was still limited, DOHMH announced sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). At this time, twenty-six NYC residents had confirmed COVID-19, and ED visits for influenza-like illness* increased, despite decreased influenza virus circulation.† The following week, on March 15, when only seven of the 56 (13%) patients with known exposure histories had exposure outside of NYC, the level of community SARS-CoV-2 transmission status was elevated from sustained community transmission to widespread community transmission (2). Through sentinel surveillance during March 1-20, DOHMH collected 544 specimens from patients with influenza-like symptoms (ILS)§ who had negative test results for influenza and, in some instances, other respiratory pathogens.¶ All 544 specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at CDC; 36 (6.6%) tested positive. Using genetic sequencing, CDC determined that the sequences of most SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens resembled those circulating in Europe, suggesting probable introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from Europe, from other U.S. locations, and local introductions from within New York. These findings demonstrate that partnering with health care facilities and developing the systems needed for rapid implementation of sentinel surveillance, coupled with capacity for genetic sequencing before an outbreak, can help inform timely containment and mitigation strategies.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; community acquired infection; Coronavirus infection; female; genetics; hospital emergency service; human; infant; isolation and purification; male; middle aged; New York; pandemic; preschool child; sentinel surveillance; sequence analysis; travel related disease; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Community-Acquired Infections; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sentinel Surveillance; Sequence Analysis; Travel-Related Illness; Young Adult","32678072","MMWR Morb.

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on ""flattening the curve"". While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.","CNN; Corona virus; COVID-19; deep learning; image processing; LSTM networks; machine learning","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; machine learning; pandemic; receiver operating characteristic; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; ROC Curve; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32708803","Viruses",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088622312

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 3218 COVID-19 confirmed patients admitted to a major healthcare system (three hospitals) in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and particularly data of all neurological symptoms were extracted from the imaging reports. Four neuroradiologists evaluated all neuroimaging studies for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19. Results: 14.1% of admitted COVID-19 patients had neuroimaging and this accounted for only 5.5% of the total imaging studies. Acute stroke was the most common finding on neuro-imaging, seen in 92.5% of patients with positive neuro-imaging studies, and present in 1.1% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with acute large ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke had much higher mortality risk adjusted for age, BMI and hypertension compared to those COVID-19 patients without neuroimaging. (Odds Ratio 6.02 by LR; Hazard Ratio 2.28 by CRR). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates acute stroke is the most common neuroimaging finding among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detection of an acute stroke is a strong prognostic marker of poor outcome. Our study also highlights the fact there is limited use of neuroimaging in these patients due to multiple logistical constraints. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Neuro-imaging; Stroke","adult; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; encephalitis; female; hospital patient; human; hypertension; incidence; lacunar stroke; major clinical study; male; mortality risk; neuroimaging; New York; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; thromboembolism; treatment outcome; acute disease; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; child; clinical trial; comorbidity; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; hospital; hypertension; infant; middle aged; multicenter study; newborn; obesity; pandemic; preschool child; prognosis; tertiary care center; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Brain Ischemia; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hospitals, Urban; Humans; Hypertension; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; New York City; Obesity; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Procedures and Techniques Utilization; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Stroke; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult","32447193","J.

However, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and much remains unknown about this disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. It is cleaved by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS)2 and disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)17 to assist viral entry into host cells. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in acute lung injury and lung fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood. Methods: The networks of ACE2 and its interacting molecules were identified using bioinformatic methods. Their gene and protein expressions were measured in human epithelial cells after 24 h SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in existing datasets of lung fibrosis patients. Results: We confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by bioinformatic analysis. TMPRSS2, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3, angiotensinogen (AGT), transformation growth factor beta (TGFB1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and fibronectin (FN) were interacted with ACE2, and the mRNA and protein of these molecules were expressed in lung epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2, TGFB1, CTGF and FN1 mRNA that were drivers of lung fibrosis. These changes were also found in lung tissues from lung fibrosis patients. Conclusions: Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 and activates fibrosis-related genes and processes to induce lung fibrosis. © 2020 The Author(s).","Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus; Lung fibrosis; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; virus receptor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; China; Coronavirus infection; cytology; disease exacerbation; epithelium cell; female; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; human; lung fibrosis; male; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; risk assessment; SARS coronavirus; survival analysis; transcription initiation; virus pneumonia; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Epithelial Cells; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Receptors, Virus; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Risk Assessment; SARS Virus; Survival Analysis; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptional Activation","32664949","Respir.

They had undergone minimal somatic mutation with limited clonal expansion, and three bound the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2. The most potent antibody bound the RBD and prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Thus, most anti-S antibodies that were generated in this patient during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD.

Our institution has treated over 2000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics including the persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Results: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-White. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (> 70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-White race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. The median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusions: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes in future outbreaks of COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Multiple myeloma; New York; Pandemic; SARS; SARS-Cov-2; Smoldering multiple myeloma","acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antibiotic agent; anticoagulant agent; azithromycin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; C reactive protein; corticosteroid; D dimer; daratumumab; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; ferritin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunomodulating agent; interleukin 1 antibody; interleukin 6 antibody; lipid; metformin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; proteasome inhibitor; remdesivir; selinexor; tumor necrosis factor antibody; unindexed drug; venetoclax; adult; age; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; cancer regression; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; disease course; disease severity; drug exposure; early intervention; epidemiological data; female; gender; home care; hospitalization; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; immunoassay; immunoglobulin deficiency; inflammation; laboratory test; lung disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality; multiple myeloma; New York; obesity; plasma transfusion; polymerase chain reaction; race difference; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoldering multiple myeloma; tertiary health care; treatment outcome; virus detection; agammaglobulinemia; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; immunocompromised patient; immunology; multiple myeloma; pandemic; pathology; risk factor; tertiary care center; virus pneumonia; Agammaglobulinemia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tertiary Care Centers","32664919","J.

Secondary Objectives: To compare the following between study arms: adverse events; symptomatic COVID-19; duration of symptomatic COVID-19; days hospitalized attributed to COVID-19; respiratory failure attributable to COVID-19 requiring i) non-invasive ventilation or ii) intubation/mechanical ventilation; mortality attributed to COVID-19, number of days unable to work attributed to COVID-19, seroconversion (COVID-19 negative to COVID-19 positive over the study period); ability of participant plasma to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro; To describe short-term psychological distress associated with risk of COVID-19 exposure at 1, 60, 120 days of the study. To explore laboratory markers within participants with confirmed COVID-19: including circulating markers of host immune and endothelial activation in participant plasma and their correlation with disease severity and outcome Trial design: The HEROS study is a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomized (1:1 allocation ratio), placebo controlled, participant and investigator-blinded, multi-site superiority trial of oral HCQ 400 mg taken once daily for 90 days as PrEP to prevent COVID-19 in health care workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At 90 days, there is an open label extension wherein all participants are offered a one-month course of HCQ 400mg once daily for PrEP of COVID-19. Participants: Frontline HCWs aged 18 years of age or older, at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (including staff of emergency departments, intensive care units, intubation teams, COVID-wards, and staff deployed to Long Term Care facilities) of five academic hospitals in downtown Toronto, Canada. Exclusion criteria include: currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study period, and/or breast feeding; known hypersensitivity/allergy to hydroxychloroquine or to 4-aminoquinoline compounds; current use of hydroxychloroquine; known prolonged QT syndrome and/or baseline resting ECG with QTc>450 ms and/or concomitant medications which simultaneously may prolong the QTc that cannot be temporarily suspended/replaced; known pre-existing retinopathy, G6PD deficiency, porphyria, liver disease including cirrhosis, encephalopathy, hepatitis or alcoholism, diabetes on oral hypoglycemics or insulin, or renal insufficiency/failure; disclosure of self-administered use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine within 12 weeks prior to study; confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 at time of enrollment. Intervention and comparator: Intervention: hydroxychloroquine, 400mg (2 tablets) orally per day. Comparator: placebo, two tablets visually identical to the intervention, orally per day Main outcomes: The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 infection). This is a composite endpoint which includes positive results from any validated SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay including detection of viral RNA, and/or seroconversion. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and then undergo monthly follow-up at day 30, 60, and 90, 120. At each visit, participants will provide an oropharyngeal sample, blood sample, and will undergo electrocardiogram monitoring of the QTc interval. Secondary outcome measures include: adverse events; symptom duration of COVID-19; days of hospitalization attributed to COVID-19; respiratory failure requiring ventilator support attributed to COVID-19; mortality attributed to COVID-19; total days off work attributed to COVID-19; seropositivity (reactive serology by day 120); and short term psychological impact of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at day 1, 60, 120 days using the K10, a validated measure of non-specific psychological distress. Randomisation: Within each site, participants will be individually randomized to either the intervention arm with HCQ or the placebo arm using a fixed 1:1 allocation ratio using an interactive web-based response system to ensure concealment of allocation. Randomization schedules will be computer-generated and blocked using variable block sizes. Blinding (masking): All participants, research coordinators, technicians, clinicians and investigators will be blinded to the participant allocation group.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the definitive test for the diagnosis of COVID-19; however, chest X-ray radiography (CXR) is a fast, effective, and affordable test that identifies the possible COVID-19-related pneumonia. This study investigates the feasibility of using a deep learning-based decision-tree classifier for detecting COVID-19 from CXR images. The proposed classifier comprises three binary decision trees, each trained by a deep learning model with convolution neural network based on the PyTorch frame. The first decision tree classifies the CXR images as normal or abnormal. The second tree identifies the abnormal images that contain signs of tuberculosis, whereas the third does the same for COVID-19. The accuracies of the first and second decision trees are 98 and 80%, respectively, whereas the average accuracy of the third decision tree is 95%. The proposed deep learning-based decision-tree classifier may be used in pre-screening patients to conduct triage and fast-track decision making before RT-PCR results are available. © Copyright © 2020 Yoo, Geng, Chiu, Yu, Cho, Heo, Choi, Choi, Cung Van, Nhung, Min and Lee.","chest X-ray radiography; COVID-19; deep learning; image classification; neural network; tuberculosis","Article; binary classification; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; decision tree; deep learning; thorax radiography; tuberculosis",,"Front.

The underlying cause(s) remain incompletely understood. In this study, in patients with an influenza A/H1N1 virus infection, viral load and platelet count correlated inversely during the acute infection phase. We confirmed this finding in a ferret model of influenza virus infection. In these animals, platelet count decreased with the degree of virus pathogenicity varying from 0% in animals infected with the influenza A/H3N2 virus, to 22% in those with the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, upto62%in animals with a highly pathogenic A/H5N1 virus infection. This thrombocytopenia is associated with virus-containing platelets that circulate in the blood. Uptake of influenza virus particles by platelets requires binding to sialoglycans and results in the removal of sialic acids by the virus neuraminidase, a trigger for hepatic clearance of platelets. We propose the clearance of influenza virus by platelets as a paradigm. These insights clarify the pathophysiology of influenza virus infection and show how severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, may propagate thrombocytopenia and/or thromboembolic complications. © 2020 American Society of Hematology.

The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is widely used in emergency medicine, but so far, no studies have evaluated its use in patients with covid-19. We aimed to study the performance of NEWS2 and compare commonly used clinical risk stratification tools at admission to predict risk of severe disease and in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study in a public non-university general hospital in the Oslo area, Norway, including a cohort of all 66 patients hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from the start of the pandemic; 13 who died during hospital stay and 53 who were discharged alive. Data were collected consecutively from March 9th to April 27th 2020. The main outcome was the ability of the NEWS2 score and other clinical risk scores at emergency department admission to predict severe disease and in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for NEWS2 scores ≥5 and ≥ 6, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score ≥ 2, ≥2 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and CRB-65 score ≥ 2. Areas under the curve (AUCs) for the clinical risk scores were compared using DeLong's test. Results: In total, 66 patients (mean age 67.9 years) were included. Of these, 23% developed severe disease. In-hospital mortality was 20%. Tachypnoea, hypoxemia and confusion at admission were more common in patients developing severe disease. A NEWS2 score ≥ 6 at admission predicted severe disease with 80.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.822, 95% CI 0.690-0.953). NEWS2 was superior to qSOFA score ≥ 2 (AUC 0.624, 95% CI 0.446-0.810, p < 0.05) and other clinical risk scores for this purpose. Conclusion: NEWS2 score at hospital admission predicted severe disease and in-hospital mortality, and was superior to other widely used clinical risk scores in patients with covid-19. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Emergency department; In-hospital mortality; NEWS2; qSOFA; Sensitivity","adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; cohort analysis; Coronavirus infection; female; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; male; middle aged; Norway; pandemic; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; severity of illness index; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Early Warning Score; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Norway; Pandemics; Patient Admission; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index","32660623","Scand.

Our aim was to explore the degree of liver damage, liver stiffness (LS) and severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. Design We investigated 32 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the University Hospital of Innsbruck in a prospective cross-sectional study. We performed laboratory testing, liver and spleen sonography and elastography to measure organ stiffness. Results 12 patients (38%) showed elevated aminotransferases and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels. LS was positively correlated with elevated aminotransferase levels in patients with COVID-19 compared with those without elevated enzymes. Even mild liver damage raised LS significantly in COVID-19 as it was in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, higher LS measurements were significantly associated with illness severity like pneumonia, need for mechanical ventilation, and even death. Conclusion Transient elastography is a useful and non-invasive tool to assess onset and severity of acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 patients. Increased LS seems to be predictive for a more severe and complicated course of disease. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Methods: We conducted an e-survey using a cloud-based website to gauge the potential sources of trustworthy information and misinformation and analyzed researchers', clinicians', and academics' attitude toward unpublished items, and pre- and post-publication quality checks in this challenging time. Results: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%] and 86 [67.2%]). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions. Most (74.2%) supported the need to launch a specialist bibliographic database for COVID-19, with information indexed (62.3%), available as open-access (82.8%), after expanding search terms (52.3%) and following due verification by academics (66.4%), and journal editors (52.3%). Conclusion: While identifying social media as a potential source of misinformation on COVID-19, and a perceived high risk of plagiarism, more stringent peer review and skilled post-publication promotion are advisable. Journal editors should play a more active role in streamlining publication and promotion of trustworthy information on COVID-19. © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","Coronavirus Disease 2019; COVID-19; Information; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Social Media","adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; pandemic; peer review; publishing; questionnaire; scientific misconduct; social media; virus pneumonia; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Peer Review; Plagiarism; Pneumonia, Viral; Publishing; Scientific Misconduct; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires","32657090","J.

As various measures have been taken successfully to combat the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a growing number of fully recovered patients have been discharged from hospitals. However, some of them have relapsed. Little is known about the causes that triggered the relapse. Case presentation: We report a case of a 40 years old man who suffered from recurrent pulmonary infection with progression of lesions on chest computed tomography (CT), elevated levels of ferritin and IL2R, reduced lymphocyte count and positive oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 again after 5 days discharge from hospital. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level of this patient was very low at the time of relapse, suggesting a weak humoral immune response to the virus. Total exon sequencing revealed mutations in TRNT1 gene, which may be responsible for B cell immunodeficiency. Therefore, uncleared SARS-CoV-2 at his first discharge was likely to lead to his recurrence. However, viral superinfection and non-infectious organizing pneumonia could not be completely excluded. Conclusion: COVID-19 relapse may occur in a part of discharged patients with low titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These patients should be maintained in isolation for longer time even after discharge. A more sensitive method to detect SARS-CoV-2 needs to be established and serological testing for specific antibodies may be used as a reference to determine the duration of isolation. © 2020 The Author(s).","Case report; Extend isolation time; New corona virus; Protective antibodies; Recurrence","arbidol; ferritin; immunoglobulin; interleukin 2 receptor; lactate dehydrogenase; methylprednisolone; antivirus agent; indole derivative; nucleotidyltransferase; TRNT1 protein, human; adult; antibody production; Article; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; exon; gene; gene mutation; gene sequence; hospital discharge; human; humoral immunity; lung infection; lymphocyte count; male; organizing pneumonia; pneumonia; recurrent disease; relapse; serology; TRNT1 gene; B lymphocyte; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; genetics; hospital; immunology; mechanical ventilator; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; recurrent disease; virus pneumonia; Adult; Antibody Formation; Antiviral Agents; B-Lymphocytes; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Hospitals; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Indoles; Male; Nucleotidyltransferases; Pandemics; Patient Discharge; Pneumonia, Viral; Recurrence; Ventilators, Mechanical","32652938","BMC Infect.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020. Blood and urine laboratory findings related to renal function were summarized, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) were also calculated to assess the renal function. Results: A total of 12 admitted hospital patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, included 3 severe cases, and 9 common cases. Serum creatinine (Scr) was not abnormally elevated in all of the patients, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was abnormally elevated in only 25.0% of the patients. However, compared with the recovery period, the patient's Scr and BUN increased significantly in peak of disease (p-scr = 0.002 & p-bun < 0.001). By observing the fluctuations in Scr and BUN from admission to recovery, it was found that the peak of Scr and BUN appeared within the first 14 day of the course of the disease. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the abnormally elevated rates of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), and urine transferring (TRU) standardized by urinary creatinine in peak of disease were 41.7, 41.7, 50.0, and 16.7%, respectively. The abnormal rates of the calculated eGFR and Ccr were 66.7 and 41.7%. Conclusion: Scr and BUN were generally increased during the course of COVID-19. Detection of urinary microproteins and application of multiple indicators assessment could be helpful for discovering abnormal renal function in patients with COVID-19. However, the evidence is limited due to the small sample size and observational nature. Additional studies, especially large prospective cohort studies, are required to confirm these findings. © Copyright © 2020 Hong, Chi, Liu, Huang, Guo, Fan, Lin, Qu, Chen, Wu, Wang, Zhang, Wu, Pan, Lin, Zhou and Zhang.","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; multiple indicators; renal function; urinary microprotein",,,"Front.

We aim to investigate the neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed critically ill patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from February 5 to April 2, 2020. Demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings, comorbidities and treatments were collected and analyzed. Results: Among 86 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 54 patients (62.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 66.6 (11.1) years. Overall, 65% patients presented with at least one neurological symptom. Twenty patients (23.3%) had symptoms involving the central nervous system, including delirium, cerebrovascular diseases and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, while 6 patients (7%) had neuromuscular involvement. Seven of 86 patients exhibited new stroke and 6 (7%) cases were ischemic. A significantly higher prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was observed in patients with ischemic stroke than in those without stroke (83.3 vs. 26.9%, p < 0.05). Patients with ischemic stroke were more likely to have a higher myoglobulin level, and a lower hemoglobin level. Conclusions: The clinical spectrum of neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was broad. Stroke, delirium and neuromuscular diseases are common neurological complications of COVID-19.

Trial design: Parallel, 2:1 randomization, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial. Participants: Male and female patients above the age of 64 (i.e. ≥65 years of age) with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by SARS-CoV2 positive throat swab (PCR). Patients can only be included within 3 days of symptom onset in ambulatory care if they consent to the study procedure and are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and protocol requirements (including telephone visits concerning symptoms and side effects). Severity of disease at inclusion is mild to moderate defined as not requiring hospital admission: SpO2 >94%, respiratory rate <20, mental state alert, no signs of septic shock. Cardiac risk is minimised by requiring a Tisdale score ≤ 6. Patients are recruited in the two german cities of Ulm and Tübingen in various ambulatory care settings. Intervention and comparator: Each patient will be given a first dose of 600 mg Hydroxychloroquine or the equivalent number of placebo capsules (3 capsules) at the day of inclusion. From the 2nd day on, each patient will get 200 mg or the equivalent number of placebo capsules twice a day (400mg/day) until day 7 (6 more does of 400 mg); a cumulative dose of 3 g. Main outcomes: Rate of hospitalization or death at day 7 after study inclusion Randomisation: All consenting adult patients having confirmed COVID-19 are randomly and blindly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to either IMP or placebo. The biostatistical center produced a randomization list (block randomization) with varying block length and stratified for the study center. This list is provided for packaging to the pharmaceutical unit which is providing encapsulated placebo and IMP. Only the pharmaceutical unit is aware of group allocation according to the randomization list. Blinding (masking): Patients and investigators, as well as treating physicians are blinded to the treatment-allocation. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): In the first stage of an adaptive design 120 patients in a 2:1 ration: 72 Verum and 36 Placebo, plus an increase for 10% drop outs. After interim analysis, the total sample size will be calculated based on the effect seen in the first stage. Total sample size is estimated approximately n = 300-400 patients.

METHODS: Postmortem examination was completed following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public guidelines. Numerous formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue types from each case were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) from FFPE lung tissue blocks. RESULTS: Postmortem examinations revealed diffuse alveolar damage, while no viral-associated hepatic, cardiac, or renal damage was observed. Viral RNA was detected in lungs, bronchi, lymph nodes, and spleen in both cases using qRT-PCR method. RNA sequencing using NGS in case 1 revealed mutations most consistent with Western European Clade A2a with ORF1a L3606F mutation. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 testing and viral sequencing can be performed from FFPE tissue. Detection and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with morphological findings from postmortem tissue examination can aid in gaining a better understanding of the virus's pathophysiologic effects on human health. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

RESULTS: The positive percent agreement was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97) for Abbott ID NOW and 100% (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for DiaSorin Simplexa and Roche cobas. The negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 0.98-1.00) for all 3 assays. All swab types tested with the Abbott assay produced concordant results. Polymerase chain reaction assays had approximately 10 to 100 times lower limits of detection than Abbott ID NOW. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these evaluations, a multiplatform testing approach is proposed, depending on patient population and assay sensitivity, to address testing needs during a public health emergency. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect three different viral RNA sequences (RdRp-gene, E-gene and Orf1 gene) of SARS-CoV-2. Results: In three out of 14 eyes SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in the retina of deceased COVID-19 patients. As analysis for three different sequences (RdRp-gene, E-gene and Orf1 gene) revealed positive results in RT-PCR, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in human retina is proven according to the standards of the World-Health-Organization.

It is mainly transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with secretions from an infected person or through inhalation of droplets containing SARS-CoV-2. It is controversial whether the virus may be transmitted via tears. Exposed ocular surface can serve as a gateway in transmission and acquiring respiratory diseases. Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job. In this narrative review we discuss current evidence around detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tears and forms of transmissions reported to date. We also provide a comprehensive approach that may be implemented in an ophthalmic care facility to protect healthcare personnel, as well as patients, from contracting the virus. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; infection control; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; exposure; eye care; eye care professional; eye disease; human; infection control; infection risk; lacrimal fluid; nonhuman; safety; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cross infection; disease transmission; health care personnel; isolation and purification; ophthalmology; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Ophthalmology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Tears","32310028","Ocul.

Prevention of epidemic rebound is a top priority of current works. However, information regarding post-discharge quarantine and surveillance of recovered patients with COVID-19 is scarce. Methods: This study followed up 337 patients with COVID-19 in a Wuhan East-West Lake Fangcang shelter hospital during the post-discharge quarantine. Demographic, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and chest computed tomography (CT) image, mental state, medication status, and nucleic acid test data were summarized and analyzed. Results: 21/337 (6.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive, and 4 /337(1.2%) patients were suspected positive. The median day interval between the discharge to nucleic acid re-positivity was 7.5 days (IQR, 6–13), ranging from 6 to 13 days. Cough/expectoration are the most common symptoms, followed by chest congestion/dyspnea during the 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine. Risk factors of nucleic acid re-positivity including the number of lobes infiltration (odds ratio[OR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09–1.19), distribution (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.13–0.19), CT imaging feature of patchy shadowing accompanying with consolidation (OR, 9.36; 95% CI, 7.84–11.17), respiratory symptoms of cough accompanying with expectoration (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28–1.52), and chest congestion accompanying by dyspnea (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28–1.57). Conclusion: The 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine may be an effective measure to prevent the outbreak from rebounding from the recovered patients. The second week is a critical period during post-discharge quarantine. Special attention should be paid to cough, expectoration, chest congestion, and dyspnea in recovered COVID-19 patients. A few recovered patients may prolong the quarantine based on clinical symptoms and signs and nucleic acid results in the 2 weeks of medical observation. © Copyright © 2020 Yan, Wang, Gao, Zhou, Ye, Xu, Cao and Zhang.","COVID-19; discharge surveillance; nucleic acid; post-discharge quarantine; re-positive","nucleic acid; adult; aged; Article; China; clinical feature; comorbidity assessment; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; female; follow up; human; lung congestion; major clinical study; male; mental health; middle aged; nucleic acid analysis; risk factor; x-ray computed tomography",,"Front.

In COVID-19 patients, the number of platelets (PLTs) and dynamic changes of PLT-related parameters are currently a concern. The present paper discusses the potential link between PLT parameters and COVID-19. Several studies have identified a link between severe COVID-19 patients and specific coagulation index, in particular, high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, and low PLT count. These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs, as well as in other organs. Further information and more advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs are needed to better estimate this link, also considering COVID-19 patients at different disease stages and stratified in different cohorts based on preexisting co-morbidity, age, and gender. Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; hematological parameters; platelets","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; beta thromboglobulin; bevacizumab; cell adhesion molecule; D dimer; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; endothelin; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; low molecular weight heparin; thrombocyte factor; thromboxane A2; von Willebrand factor; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anticoagulant agent; biological marker; cell adhesion molecule; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; virus receptor; age; antiviral therapy; Article; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; environmental factor; heredity; human; lung blood vessel; lung embolism; lung endothelium; lymphocyte count; Middle East respiratory syndrome; platelet count; priority journal; prothrombin time; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; thrombocyte function; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; blood; blood clotting parameters; comparative study; complication; Coronavirus infection; disseminated intravascular clotting; drug interaction; endothelium cell; inflammation; lung; metabolism; pandemic; pathology; physiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; thrombocyte; thrombophilia; ultrastructure; vascular endothelium; vein thrombosis; virus pneumonia; Anticoagulants; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Blood Platelets; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Drug Interactions; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Vascular; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Humans; Inflammation; Lung; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Platelet Count; Platelet Function Tests; Pneumonia, Viral; Prothrombin Time; Receptors, Virus; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Thrombophilia; Venous Thrombosis","32397915","Platelets",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086006857

The survey included categorical socio-demographic and health-related variables. A total of 1830 participants were selected for statistical data processing (a response rate of 90.9%). We determined reasonable reliability of the survey section for clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cronbach’s Alpha 0.671). Two meaningful dimensions were identified through CATPCA (Categorical Principal Component Analysis) for the survey’s items. We separated two significant clusters of items, each measuring a distinct factor: the sociodemographic characteristics linked to social distancing and the relevant clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, a two-step cluster analysis helped to classify the sample group taking into consideration the similarity of subjects. The clustering revealed a three-cluster solution, with significant differences between clusters and allowed the cluster detection of a group of individuals, possibly more affected by the infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Through binomial logistic regression analysis, we identified a statistically significant prediction model for the presumptive diagnostic of some relevant clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study validated a cost-effective model for rapid assessment of the health status of subjects, adapted to the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Governments issued travel restrictions, gatherings of institutions were cancelled, and citizens were ordered to socially distance themselves in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Fear of being infected by the virus and panic over job losses and missed education opportunities have increased people’s stress levels. Psychological studies using traditional surveys are time-consuming and contain cognitive and sampling biases, and therefore cannot be used to build large datasets for a real-time depression analysis. In this article, we propose a CorExQ9 algorithm that integrates a Correlation Explanation (CorEx) learning algorithm and clinical Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) lexicon to detect COVID-19 related stress symptoms at a spatiotemporal scale in the United States. The proposed algorithm overcomes the common limitations of traditional topic detection models and minimizes the ambiguity that is caused by human interventions in social media data mining. The results show a strong correlation between stress symptoms and the number of increased COVID-19 cases for major U.S. cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Miami. The results also show that people’s risk perception is sensitive to the release of COVID-19 related public news and media messages. Between January and March, fear of infection and unpredictability of the virus caused widespread panic and people began stockpiling supplies, but later in April, concerns shifted as financial worries in western and eastern coastal areas of the U.S. left people uncertain of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives. © 2020 by the authors.

This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor–strain–outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour. This study also theorized the concept of human agonistic behaviour, which has key implications for future researchers. © 2020 by the authors.

In this work 595 health care workers from a public company were tested for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (82 positive) and asked to complete a questionnaire on early COVID-19 symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were present in 56.1% of cases.

The early diagnosis of COVID-19 in health care workers, must consider, in addition to respiratory disorders and fever, anosmia, dysgeusia, exhaustion, myalgias and enteric disorders. The frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in the population examined was not higher than that commonly recorded in the same company during periodic checks in the years preceding the epidemic. In COVID-19 cases there was a significant risk of anxiety, especially in those who had low sleep quality. Mental health support and improvement interventions must mainly concern workers with positive tests and should also tend to improve sleep quality. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the risk factors for disease progression of cases with COVID-19. Based on the clinical types, the patients were divided into a progression group and an improvement group. Multivariable logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. Results: A total of 101 patients were included in this study; diseases progression occurred in 17 patients, 84 patients improved, 6 were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU), and 5 died. The mean time to obtain negative nucleic acid results was 12.5 ± 5.0 days. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (OR, 0.104; p =.002), C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR, 0.093; p <.001) and lymphocyte count (OR, 3.397; p =.022) were risk factors for disease progression. ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUC of age, CRP and lymphocyte count for disease progression were 0.873, 0.911 and 0.817, respectively. Conclusions: Older age increased CRP and decreased lymphocyte count resulted in potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression. This may be helpful in identifying patients whose condition worsens at an early stage. © 2020, © 2020 Society for Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases.","COVID-19; risk factors outcome","C reactive protein; C reactive protein; adult; age distribution; aged; aging; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease course; disease exacerbation; female; hospital patient; human; intensive care unit; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; mortality; prognosis; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; Betacoronavirus; blood; China; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; epidemiology; hospitalization; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; risk factor; statistical model; treatment outcome; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Beijing; Betacoronavirus; C-Reactive Protein; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Lymphocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Treatment Outcome","32370577","Infect.

Patients were stratified according to the symptoms’ onset. A total of 52 patients (75.4%) were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive being SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. The remaining 17 (24.6%) were negative for COVID-19 and excluded from the analysis. We reported that only 34 out of 52 patients (65.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Moreover, the median time from onset of symptoms and enrolment was significantly higher in those patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs, suggesting that symptoms might last longer than SARS-CoV-2 replication. The great majority of patients (80%) developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG at three weeks after symptoms’ onset while the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dramatically decreased over time, suggesting the crucial role of combination of molecular and serological assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in those patients reporting mild symptoms. © 2020 by the authors.

Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. Study design: Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. Results: In 5 of 316 (1.6 %) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group (2/37 (5.4 %) vs. 3/244 (1.2 %), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20 %) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. Conclusion: The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6 %).

Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by the RT-PCR assay. The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using the RT-PCR assay (p = 0.001). The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is currently used for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. Despite the high sensitivity of the qRT-PCR method, false negative outcomes might occur, especially in patients with a low viral load. Here, we developed a multiplex qRT-PCR methodology for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome (N gene) and of the human RNAse P gene as internal control. We found that multiplex qRT-PCR was effective in detecting SARS-Cov-2 infection in human specimens with 100% sensitivity. Notably, patients with few copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (<5 copies/reaction) were successfully detected by the novel multiplex qRT-PCR method. Finally, we assessed the efficacy of multiplex qRT-PCR on human nasopharyngeal swabs without RNA extraction.

Methods: Retrospectively, ten children with confirmed COVID-19 in the Jinan Infectious Disease Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University were enrolled between January 23, 2020 to March 9, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of the children were analyzed. RT-PCR assays were performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in the respiratory tract and fecal specimens in the follow-up after discharge. Results: Among ten patients, five (50%) were asymptomatic and five (50%) showed mild symptoms of respiratory illness. The average age of asymptomatic children was younger than that of symptomatic children (p = 0.03). The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) (p = 0.03) and lymphocyte (p = 0.03) counts were more severe in symptomatic patients than those in asymptomatic patients. During the follow-up examination after discharge, seven out of ten patients contained SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in their fecal specimens, despite all patients showed negative results in respiratory tract specimens. One out of those seven patients relapsed. The median time from onset to being negative results in respiratory tract and fecal specimens was 9 days and 34.43 days, respectively.

Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. Study design: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. Results: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs Conclusion: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; GeneXpert; Molecular point of care test; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; human; limit of detection; multicenter study; Netherlands; nonhuman; pandemic; point of care testing; priority journal; quality control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; respiratory virus; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; nasopharynx; procedures; reproducibility; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; time factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nasopharynx; Netherlands; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Point-of-Care Testing; Reproducibility of Results; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Time Factors; Viral Load","32417674","J.

At present, there are no approved vaccines nor antiviral therapies available. The detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies plays a crucial role in the assessment of the immune status of convalescent COVID-19 patients, evaluation of recombinant therapeutic antibodies, and the evaluation of novel vaccines. To detect SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, classically, a virus-neutralization test has to be performed at biosafety level 3, considerably limiting the general use of this test. In the present work, a biosafety level 1 pseudotype virus assay based on a propagation-incompetent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been used to determine the neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent COVID-19 patients. The neutralization titers in serum of two independently analyzed patient cohorts were available within 18 h and correlated well with those obtained with a classical SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test (Pearson correlation coefficients of r = 0.929 and r = 0.939, respectively). Most convalescent COVID-19 patients had only low titers of neutralizing antibodies (ND50 < 320). The sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients also neutralized pseudotype virus displaying the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein on their surface, which is homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In summary, we report a robust virus-neutralization assay, which can be used at low biosafety level 1 to rapidly quantify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. © 2020, MDPI AG.

COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures were implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong. Methods: A regression model is adopted to quantify the association between the SARS-CoV-2 detection delay and calendar time. The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model. Findings: The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5 − 11.5) in the second half of January, reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5 − 9.5) in the first half of February 2020. We estimate that SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency improved at a daily rate of 5.40% (95%CI: 2.54 − 8.33) in Hong Kong. Conclusions: The detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 was likely being improved substantially in Hong Kong since the first imported case was detected. Sustaining enforcement in timely detection and other effective control measures are recommended to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 The Authors","confirmation efficiency; COVID-19; early outbreak; Hong Kong","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; delayed diagnosis; epidemic; Hong Kong; human; infection control; major clinical study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; delayed diagnosis; Hong Kong; pandemic; proportional hazards model; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delayed Diagnosis; Disease Outbreaks; Hong Kong; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Proportional Hazards Models","32413609","Int.

COVID-19 is known to produce similar clinical manifestations to SARS of the last decade. Fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, and sore throat are some of the most common symptoms and the median incubation period is around 4 days. While the respiratory symptoms often bring the patients to medical attention, clinical manifestations on the gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary system have also been cautiously observed. It has been reported that approximately 1-5% of cases developed diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, sometimes preceding the respiratory symptoms. As hemorrhagic colitis was reported in one case with SARS-CoV-2, detected in stool, there is a possibility of fecal-oral transmission of the virus is possible in humans. Thus, it is widely recommended that non-urgent and low prior endoscopic procedures be postponed. For patients requiring urgent endoscopic procedures, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing from the throat swabs is used as a screening test within 48 hours prior. Minimal personnel, infection control training, and usage of negative pressure rooms are recommended. Abnormal liver function tests have been commonly reported. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can have a true liver injury, which is however mild. The abnormal liver function test values may be caused, at least partially, by muscle injury or hemolysis. Nevertheless drugs with hepatotoxicity should be used with increased caution. © 2020 Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.","Endoscopy; Epidemiology; Hepatology; SARS-CoV-2; Transplantation",,,"Siriraj Med.

During both the initial and peak phases of the epidemic, the administration of disease-modifying drugs, typically immunosuppressants administered in pulses, was suspended due to the uncertainty about their impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, mainly in contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. The purpose of this study is to present a safety algorithm enabling patients to resume pulse immunosuppressive therapy (PIT) during the easing of lockdown measures. Methods: We developed a safety algorithm based on our clinical experience with MS and the available published evidence; the algorithm assists in the detection of contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases and of patients with mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a view to withdrawing PIT in these patients and preventing new infections at day hospitals. Results: We developed a clinical/microbiological screening algorithm consisting of a symptom checklist, applied during a teleconsultation 48 hours before the scheduled session of PIT, and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal exudate 24 hours before the procedure. Conclusion: The application of our safety algorithm presents a favourable risk-benefit ratio despite the fact that the actual proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals is unknown. Systematic PCR testing, which provides the highest sensitivity for detecting presymptomatic cases, combined with early detection of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce infections and improve detection of high-risk patients before they receive PIT. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Neurología","COVID-19; Immunosuppressants; Multiple sclerosis; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","immunosuppressive agent; algorithm; ambulatory care; asymptomatic disease; Betacoronavirus; checklist; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; drug contraindication; drug pulse therapy; human; immunocompromised patient; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; mass screening; multiple sclerosis; nasopharynx; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; quarantine; risk assessment; symptom assessment; telemedicine; virology; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Ambulatory Care; Asymptomatic Diseases; Betacoronavirus; Checklist; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Contraindications, Drug; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Immunosuppressive Agents; Mass Screening; Multiple Sclerosis; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pulse Therapy, Drug; Quarantine; Risk Assessment; Symptom Assessment; Telemedicine","32591152","Neurologia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086776126

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Two quantitative automated immunoassays (Maglumi™2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. Results: Maglumi™ IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4 % versus 64.3 %). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The two tests showed similar specificity for IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70 %) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91 %–94 %) after 14 days. Conclusion: This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CLIA; COVID-19; ELISA; Immunoassays; Lateral flow assays; SARS-CoV-2","immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; virus antibody; antibody detection; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; evaluation study; false positive result; human; immunoassay; major clinical study; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative assay; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus detection; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; immunoassay; immunology; isolation and purification; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity","32403010","J.

Despite this lengthy interval, implementation of specific quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests in the US has been slow, and testing is still not widely available. Metagenomic sequencing offers the promise of unbiased detection of emerging pathogens, without requiring prior knowledge of the identity of the responsible agent or its genomic sequence. METHODS: To evaluate metagenomic approaches in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, laboratory-confirmed positive and negative samples from Seattle, WA were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing, with comparison to a 2019 reference genomic database created before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Within 36 h our results showed clear identification of a novel human Betacoronavirus, closely related to known Betacoronaviruses of bats, in laboratory-proven cases of SARS-CoV-2. A subset of samples also showed superinfection or colonization with human parainfluenza virus 3 or Moraxella species, highlighting the need to test directly for SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to ruling out an infection using a viral respiratory panel. Samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were also negative by metagenomic analysis, and positive for Rhinovirus A and C. Unlike targeted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR testing, metagenomic analysis of these SARS-CoV-2 negative samples identified candidate etiological agents for the patients' respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate the value of metagenomic analysis in the monitoring and response to this and future viral pandemics. © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases. © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","blood coagulation; coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2","antithrombin; fibrin; fibrin degradation product; fibrinogen; anticoagulant agent; biological marker; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; fibrinogen; prothrombin; activated partial thromboplastin time; Article; blood clotting; bloodstream infection; clinical feature; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; female; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; prothrombin time; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thrombin time; adult; Betacoronavirus; blood; blood clotting; blood clotting test; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; middle aged; pandemic; partial thromboplastin time; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Adult; Anticoagulants; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Blood Coagulation; Blood Coagulation Tests; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Fibrinogen; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Partial Thromboplastin Time; Pneumonia, Viral; Prothrombin; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32172226","Clin.

We provide here bio-informatic, evolutionary analysis of 351 available sequences of its genome with the aim of mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of selection. Methods: A Maximum likelihood tree has been built and selective pressure has been investigated in order to find any mutation developed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that could potentially affect clinical evolution of the infection. Finding: We have found in more recent isolates the presence of two mutations affecting the Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) and the Open Reding Frame10 (ORF 10) adjacent regions. Amino acidic change stability analysis suggests both mutations could confer lower stability of the protein structures. Interpretation: One of the two mutations, likely developed within the genome during virus spread, could affect virus intracellular survival.

However, the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the excreta of COVID-19 patients. Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool, and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and its correlation analyzed with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, and this was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in the feces after the pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from the feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did not differ between patients who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients. Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of COVID-19 patients and suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","coronavirus disease 2019; fecal-oral transmission; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral RNA; viral shedding","virus RNA; virus RNA; abdominal pain; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease severity; feces analysis; female; gastrointestinal symptom; human; male; nausea; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; urinalysis; virus shedding; virus transmission; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; electronic health record; epidemic; feces; genetics; isolation and purification; middle aged; pandemic; pathogenicity; pharynx; severity of illness index; virology; virus pneumonia; virus shedding; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Electronic Health Records; Feces; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Virus Shedding","32243607","J.

The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is often delayed compared to that of respiratory symptoms. It has been noted that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in fecal matter for an extended period of time, even after respiratory samples have tested negative and patients are asymptomatic.

Methods: In a prospective study, patients from two states in Australia attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs (SCNT) prior to health worker collect (HC) using throat and nasal swabs (Site 1) or throat and nasopharyngeal swabs (Site 2). Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa (κ) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load. Results: Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC (κ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (κ = 0.959 vs 0.933). Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT. Conclusions: Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Diagnosis; PCR; Respiratory viruses; SARS-CoV-2; Self-collection","adenovirus infection; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; Human adenovirus 1; Human metapneumovirus; Human metapneumovirus infection; Human respiratory syncytial virus; influenza A; Influenza A virus; influenza B; Influenza B virus; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nonhuman; nose smear; pandemic; Parainfluenza virus infection; Paramyxovirinae; priority journal; prospective study; respiratory syncytial virus infection; respiratory virus; Rhinovirus; Rhinovirus infection; sampling; self care; self collection; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus detection; virus load; Australia; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; middle aged; nasopharynx; nose; pharynx; procedures; reproducibility; specimen handling; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharynx; Nose; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Specimen Handling; Viral Load; Young Adult","32403007","J.

Furthermore, autopsies are essential for the correct statistical recording of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths. In the northern German Federal State of Hamburg, all deaths of Hamburg citizens with ante- or postmortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have been autopsied since the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany. Our evaluation provides a systematic overview of the first 80 consecutive full autopsies. A proposal for the categorisation of deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented (category 1: definite COVID-19 death; category 2: probable COVID-19 death; category 3: possible COVID-19 death with an equal alternative cause of death; category 4: SARS-CoV-2 detection with cause of death not associated to COVID-19). In six cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed postmortem by a positive PCR test in a nasopharyngeal or lung tissue swab. In the other 74 cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection had already been known antemortem. The deceased were aged between 52 and 96 years (average 79.2 years, median 82.4 years). In the study cohort, 34 deceased were female (38%) and 46 male (62%). Overall, 38% of the deceased were overweight or obese. All deceased, except for two women, in whom no significant pre-existing conditions were found autoptically, had relevant comorbidities (in descending order of frequency): (1) diseases of the cardiovascular system, (2) lung diseases, (3) central nervous system diseases, (4) kidney diseases, and (5) diabetes mellitus. A total of 76 cases (95%) were classified as COVID-19 deaths, corresponding to categories 1–3. Four deaths (5%) were defined as non-COVID-19 deaths with virus-independent causes of death. In eight cases, pneumonia was combined with a fulminant pulmonary artery embolism. Peripheral pulmonary artery embolisms were found in nine other cases. Overall, deep vein thrombosis has been found in 40% of the cases.

Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid testing for highly urgent cases. In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. Methods: A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab. Results: The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/mL and no false positives during evaluation of cross-reactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100 % and 99.2 % respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3 %. Conclusion: The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay.

There is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Methods: When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has reached Italy, we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with IEI, to perform SARS-CoV-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting. Results: We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions. Both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and anorexia and associated with elevation of CRP and ferritin, but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care. Conclusion: Our report suggests that XLA patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but can recover from infection, suggesting that B-cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease. However, there is a need for larger observational studies to extend these conclusions to other patients with similar genetic immune defects. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Objective: This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations. Study design: A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay. Results: Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert. Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively. Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value <30). However, for Ct values >30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert. Conclusions: While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations.

At the time of writing, the death toll was greater than 120 000 worldwide with more than 2 million documented infections. The genome of the CoV encodes a number of structural proteins that facilitate cellular entry and assembly of virions, of which the spike protein S appears to be critical for cellular entry. The spike protein guides the virus to attach to the host cell. The spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fusion domain and a transmembrane domain. The RBD of spike protein S binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate cellular entry. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to the pangolin and bat CoVs and these also use ACE2 as a receptor. Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 exposes the cleavage sites to cellular proteases. Cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 and other cellular proteases initiates fusion and endocytosis. The spike protein contains an addition furin cleavage site that may allow it to be ' preactivated' and highly infectious after replication. The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests.

Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate pharmacological treatment.

Even patients infected by SARS-CoV‑2 or COVID-19 may need operative procedures. Currently, no uniform recommendations exist on precautions to be taken when operating on these patients. Furthermore, they may differ from one hospital to another. Methods: The task force COVID-19 of the emergency, intensive and severely injured section of the German Trauma Society (DGU e. V.) has developed consensus-based recommendations on surgical treatment of patients with SARS-CoV‑2 infections. Great importance is placed on the implementation in hospitals at all levels of care. Results: The indications for surgical interventions in patients with COVID-19 infections require an extremely critical evaluation. When indicated these surgical intervention should ideally be performed in a separate operating theater. All personnel involved should wear personal protective equipment with FFP2 masks, face shields and double gloves. The emergency team in the resuscitation bay should generally wear the same personal protective equipment. Special training is mandatory and the exposure of team members should be minimized. Conclusion: The recommendations are principally used for all kinds of surgery and comply with the currently available knowledge. Nevertheless, all recommendations represent a compromise between maximum safety of all medical staff and practicability in the routine hospital workflow. © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Medical staff safety; Pandemic; Personal protective equipment; Surgery","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; general surgery; Germany; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; General Surgery; Germany; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32488319","Unfallchirurg",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085880904

Although molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are needed for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir, and epidemiologic studies. We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein-specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset.

This review examines the evidence for this hypothesis, and its implications for clinical practice. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is transmitted by person-to-person contact, via airborne droplets, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) to facilitate infection in humans. This review sets out to evaluate evidence for the ocular surface as a route of infection. A literature search in this area was conducted on 15 April 2020 using the Scopus database. In total, 287 results were returned and reviewed. There is preliminary evidence for ACE2 expression on corneal and conjunctival cells, but most of the other receptors to which coronaviruses bind appear to be found under epithelia of the ocular surface. Evidence from animal studies is limited, with a single study suggesting viral particles on the eye can travel to the lung, resulting in very mild infection. Coronavirus infection is rarely associated with conjunctivitis, with occasional cases reported in patients with confirmed COVID-19, along with isolated cases of conjunctivitis as a presenting sign. Coronaviruses have been rarely isolated from tears or conjunctival swabs. The evidence suggests coronaviruses are unlikely to bind to ocular surface cells to initiate infection. Additionally, hypotheses that the virus could travel from the nasopharynx or through the conjunctival capillaries to the ocular surface during infection are probably incorrect. Conjunctivitis and isolation of the virus from the ocular surface occur only rarely, and overwhelmingly in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Necessary precautions to prevent person-to-person transmission should be employed in clinical practice throughout the pandemic, and patients should be reminded to maintain good hygiene practices. © 2020 Optometry Australia","ACE2; conjunctivitis; coronavirus; COVID-19; ocular surface; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; virus receptor; animal; Betacoronavirus; conjunctivitis; Coronavirus infection; eye; genetics; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Conjunctivitis; Coronavirus Infections; Eye; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus","32406140","Clin.

Given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA has demonstrated stability, we posited that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) may be a viable transport medium, as an alternative to VTM, for clinical real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing. The intra-individual reliability and interindividual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR were assessed in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS to evaluate the stability of the qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours. We report that the use of PBS as a transport medium allows high intra-individual and interindividual reliability, maintains viral stability, and compares with VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage. This study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Use of PBS as a transport medium has the potential to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, aiding more widespread screening and early diagnosis of COVID-19. © 2020 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology",,"nucleocapsid protein; open reading frame 1ab; phosphate buffered saline; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus DNA; virus RNA; virus spike protein; virus RNA; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; intermethod comparison; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; room temperature; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; storage temperature; virus detection; virus gene; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; pandemic; predictive value; preservation; procedures; specimen handling; virology; virus culture; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Predictive Value of Tests; Preservation, Biological; RNA, Viral; Saline Solution; Specimen Handling; Virus Cultivation","32405270","J.

Methods: Salivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR. The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected. Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered. Results: Twenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females. The mean age was 61.5 +/− 11.2 years. Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases. All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse association between LDH and Ct values. Two patients showed positive salivary results on the same days when their pharyngeal or respiratory swabs showed conversion. Conclusions: Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2.

Increasingly, confirmed patients being discharged according to the current diagnosis and treatment protocols, follow-up of convalescent patients is important to knowing about the outcome. Methods: A retrospective study was performed among 98 convalescent patients with COVID-19 in a single medical center. The clinical features of patients during their hospitalization and 2-week postdischarge quarantine were collected. Results: Among the 98 COVID-19 convalescent patients, 17 (17.3%) were detected positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid during 2-week postdischarge quarantine. The median time from discharge to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive was 4 days (IQR, 3-8.5).The median time from symptoms onset to final respiratory SARS-CoV-2 detection of negative result was significantly longer in re-positive group (34 days [IQR, 29.5-42.5]) than in non-re-positive group (19 days [IQR, 16-26]). On the other hand, the levels of CD3-CD56 + NK cells during hospitalization and 2-week postdischarge were higher in re-positive group than in non-re-positive group (repeated measures ANOVA, P =.018). However, only one case in re-positive group showed exudative lesion recurrence in pulmonary computed tomography (CT) with recurred symptoms. Conclusion: It is still possible for convalescent patients to show positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, but most of the re-positive patients showed no deterioration in pulmonary CT findings.

Aim: To evaluate the knowledge Latin American gastroenterologists and endoscopists (staff physicians and residents) have about the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the prevention measures to be taken during endoscopic procedures. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Results: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications. There was a lack of knowledge about prevention measures (during clinical care and endoscopic procedures) and the reprocessing of endoscopic equipment by 70% and 48%, respectively, of those surveyed.

Due to the pathophysiological characteristics of the COVID-19 syndrome, the particular transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the high globalization of our era, the epidemic emergency from China has spread rapidly all over the world. Human-to-human transmission seems to occur mainly through close contact with symptomatic people affected by COVID-19, and the main way of contagion is via the inhalation of respiratory droplets, for example when patients talk, sneeze or cough. The ability of the virus to survive outside living organisms, in aerosol or on fomites has also been recognized. The dental practitioners are particularly exposed to a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because they cannot always respect the interpersonal distance of more than a meter and are exposed to saliva, blood, and other body fluids during surgical procedures. Moreover, many dental surgeries can generate aerosol, and the risk of airborne infection is to be considered higher. The aim of this paper is to provide practical advice for dentists based on the recent literature, which may be useful in reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 during clinical practice. © 2020 by the authors.

Employing multiple bioinformatics and computational pipelines on transcriptome data from primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) during SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed activation of several mechanistic networks, including those involved in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and interferon lambda (IFNL) in host cells. Induction of acute inflammatory response and activation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was prominent in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells. Additionally, disease and functional analysis employing ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed activation of functional categories related to cell death, while those associated with viral infection and replication were suppressed. Several interferon (IFN) responsive gene targets (IRF9, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, IFI44 and IFI44L) were highly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected NBHE cell, implying activation of antiviral IFN innate response. Gene ontology and functional annotation of differently expressed genes in patient lung tissues with COVID-19 revealed activation of antiviral response as the hallmark. Mechanistic network analysis in IPA identified 14 common activated, and 9 common suppressed networks in patient tissue, as well as in the NHBE cell model, suggesting a plausible role for these upstream regulator networks in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our data revealed expression of several viral proteins in vitro and in patient-derived tissue, while several host-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified. Our data highlights activation of IFN response as the main hallmark associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in human, and identified several differentially expressed lncRNAs during the course of infection, which could serve as disease biomarkers, while their precise role in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 remains to be investigated. © 2020 by the authors.

Knowledge on the outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Nigeria would assist in provision of preventive measures to reduce transmission among populations at risk. This study aimed to investigate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. A total of 39 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFlu™ database on 29 March 2020 to investigate its evolution in Nigeria. Sequences were selected based on the travel history of the individual and the collection date. Other sequences were not selected because they were short, contained artefacts, were not from an original source or had insufficient information. Evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the general time reversible model. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the common ancestor of each strain. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain in Nigeria clustered in a monophyletic clade with a Wuhan sublineage. Nucleotide alignment also showed a 100% similarity indicating a common origin of evolution. Comparative analysis showed 27 972 (93.6%) identical sites and 97.6% pairwise identity with the consensus. The study evidently showed the entire outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nigeria stemmed from a single introduction sharing consensus similarity with the reference SARS-CoV-2 human genome from Wuhan. Preventive measures that can limit the spread of the infection among populations at risk should be implemented. © 2020","Evolutionary analysis; Nigeria; preventive measures; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; transmission chain","algorithm; allele; Article; comparative study; data base; environmental change; evolution; gene sequence; genetic variation; genome; human; Nigeria; nucleotide sequence; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; priority journal; protein localization; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social change",,"New Microbes New Infect.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086661544

Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of vaccines and antivirals. Since age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters. We propose that comparative assessment in young versus aged hamsters of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and treatments may yield valuable information, as this small-animal model appears to mirror age-dependent differences in human patients. © 2020 by the authors.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required. Results: The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9–3.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2–1.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9–3.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2–1.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL. Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay. Clinical performances of Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method. Concordance analysis showed an “almost perfect” agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being κ = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980. Conclusions: The high sensitivity and specificity of this new assay indicate that it is promising for laboratory diagnosis, enabling highspeed detection in just over one hour, which is significantly faster than the up to five hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients. © 2020","Rapid response; Real-time RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Surveillance","virus RNA; virus RNA; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; gene targeting; human; limit of detection; major clinical study; nose smear; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus gene; virus isolation; virus strain; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic test; immunology; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Humans; Limit of Detection; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32388470","J.

SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. Objective: To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. Results: LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8–35.7 (10–20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0–36.2 (1–10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. Conclusion: A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","BAL; Coronavirus; CSF; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity; Specimen type","balanced salt solution; phosphate buffered saline; Article; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; feces; human; human cell; limit of detection; lung lavage; n1 gene; n2 gene; nonhuman; nose smear; plasma; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum; validation study; virus detection; virus gene; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Feces; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sputum","32405257","J.

In this article, we critically examine the available data on the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through organ transplantation. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from nonlung clinical specimens, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsy specimens, previous experience with the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the vast experience with other common RNA respiratory viruses are all addressed. Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart. Other considerations including ethical, financial, societal, and logistical concerns are also addressed.

The treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases has to be adapted during the pandemic but must still be guaranteed. © 2020, The Author(s).","ARDS; Chronic lung disease; Community acquired pneumonia; COVID-19; SARS-CoV‑2","influenza vaccine; steroid; Article; asthma; breathing exercise; bronchoscopy; chronic lung disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; cystic fibrosis; epidemiological data; heart rehabilitation; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; infectious agent; influenza vaccination; inhalational drug administration; intensive care; interstitial lung disease; lung cancer; lung function test; lung transplantation; medical society; mortality risk; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; pediatric patient; practice guideline; pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary rehabilitation; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory care; respiratory nursing; respiratory tract intubation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sleep disordered breathing; smoking cessation; smoking cessation program; steroid therapy; systemic therapy; tracheotomy; treatment withdrawal; virus diagnosis; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; adolescent; adult; Austria; Betacoronavirus; child; chronic disease; complication; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; lung disease; pandemic; practice guideline; pulmonology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Austria; Betacoronavirus; Child; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Lung Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pulmonary Medicine","32533443","Wien.

Design: Case investigation. Setting and Subjects: All 79 residents and 34 health care personnel (HCP) of an NH. Methods: Seven days after identification of a COVID-19 resident, all residents and HCP underwent real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs. This was repeated weekly in all previously negative subjects until the testing identified no new cases, and in all positive subjects until the testing was negative. COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with COVID-19 symptoms. Standard IPC was also implemented in all HCP. Six weeks after initial testing, all residents underwent testing for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms were serially recorded in residents and HCP. Results: A total of 36 residents had a positive rRT-PCR at baseline and 2 at day 7. Six HCP had a positive rRT-PCR at baseline and 2 at day 7. No new COVID-19 cases were diagnosed later. Among the SARS-CoV-2–positive cases, 6 residents (16%) and 3 HCP (37%) were asymptomatic during the 14 days before testing. Twenty-five residents (92.3%) and all 8 HCP (100%) with a positive rRT-PCR developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among the residents and HCP always having tested negative, 2 (5%) and 5 (11.5%), respectively, developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These 2 residents had typical COVID-19 symptoms before and after testing and 2/5 HCP were asymptomatic before and after testing. Conclusions and Implications: This study shows the validity of the updated American Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes (NHs). It suggests implementing COVID-19 IPC in both residents and HCP with positive testing or COVID-19 symptoms and warns that asymptomatic HCP with repeated negative rRT-PCR testing can develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; nursing home; rRT-PCR","immunoglobulin G antibody; virus antibody; virus DNA; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; clinical effectiveness; control strategy; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; infection control; infection prevention; major clinical study; nursing home; nursing home patient; nursing home personnel; observational study; pandemic; practice guideline; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; repeat procedure; residential home; seroconversion; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; standard; test retest reliability; throat culture; very elderly; contact examination; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; female; health care personnel; laboratory technique; male; occupational health; organization and management; patient safety; prevention and control; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; United States; vertical transmission; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; DNA, Viral; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Nursing Homes; Occupational Health; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Skilled Nursing Facilities; United States","32674822","J.

However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. Methods: Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription PCR conversion at the No. 3 People’s Hospital of Hubei province, China, between 31 January and 9 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (interquartile range 18–32 days). Older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.05; p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10–5.36; p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days versus 28.5 days; log-rank p<0.001). Conclusion: Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.

The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nucleic acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1–7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8–14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen's kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Colloidal gold-based; Covid-19; Immunochromatographic strip; Real-time RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Serology","gold derivative; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; virus antibody; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; adult; aged; Article; bioassay; blood sampling; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; major clinical study; male; onset age; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; university hospital; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; immunoassay; immunology; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serologic Tests; Young Adult","32283141","J.

A viral nucleic acid test is used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and some hematological indicators have been used in the auxiliary diagnosis and identification of the severity of COVID-19. Regarding body fluid samples, except for being used for nucleic acid testing, the relationship between COVID-19 and routine body fluid parameters is not known. Our aim was to investigate the value of urine biochemical parameters in the prediction of the severity of COVID-19. A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 67, severe 42 and critical 10), and 45 healthy persons were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The relationship between the results of urine biochemical parameters and the severity of COVID-19 was analyzed. The positive rates of urine occult blood (BLOOD) and proteinuria (PRO) were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05); the urine specific gravity (SG) value was lower in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), and the urine potential of hydrogen (pH) value was higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.01). The positive rates of urine glucose (GLU-U) and PRO in the severe and critical groups were higher than those in the moderate group (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively); other biochemical parameters of urine were not associated with the severity of COVID-19. Some urine biochemical parameters are different between patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and healthy controls, and GLU-U and PRO may be helpful for the differentiation of COVID-19 severity. © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; urine biochemical parameters","biological marker; aged; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; pandemic; pathogenicity; severity of illness index; urine; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Urine","32286242","Clin.

It has been reported that right from the beginning of the outbreak in Lombardy up to 20% of the doctors and nurses became infected. Under these circumstances, the regular operation of health institutions already suffering from a shortage of staff becomes difficult. This has led to complete or partial shutdowns of hospitals, either due to a lack of uninfected personnel or because of uncontrollable chains of infection endangering patients. In one of the largest university perinatal center in Bavaria with more than 3000 births per year, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in March 2020, affecting 36 staff members, including doctors, nurses, and midwives. Here, we describe the outbreak and present the measures contributing to the successful containment of the outbreak within three weeks. At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apart from massive testing of personnel in pre-defined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them. Overall, only a bundle of measures is needed to contain such an outbreak. © 2020 The Authors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was ≥96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; COVID-19; In vitro diagnostics; nCoV-2019; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","RNA polymerase; virus RNA; RNA directed DNA polymerase; Article; clinical assessment; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; genetic code; human; limit of detection; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase","32416600","J.

Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed.Methods: Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a respiratory surveillance ward (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done. Patients could be transferred when SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative on 2 consecutive occasions, 24 hours apart.Results: Over the study period, 1,178 patients were admitted to the RSWs. The mean length-of-stay (LOS) was 1.89 days (SD, 1.23). Among confirmed cases of pneumonia admitted to the RSW, 5 of 310 patients (1.61%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This finding was comparable to the pickup rate from our isolation ward. In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE. In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure. No patient-HCW transmission was detected despite intensive surveillance.Conclusions: Our institution successfully utilized the strategy of an RSW over a 6-week period to contain a cluster of COVID-19 cases and to prevent patient-HCW transmission. However, this method was resource-intensive in terms of testing and bed capacity. © 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

A rapid expansion in cases affecting most countries around the globe led to major changes in the way people live their daily lives. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health and Social Care directed healthcare providers to establish additional resources to manage the anticipated surge in cases that could overwhelm the health services. A priority area was testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its detection by qualitative RT-PCR. Design: A laboratory workflow twinning research environment with clinical laboratory capabilities was implemented and validated in the University of Birmingham within 4 days of the project initiation. The diagnostic capability was centred on an IVD CE-marked RT-PCR kit and designed to provide surge capacity to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The service was initially tasked with testing healthcare workers (HCW) using throat swabs, and subsequently the process investigated the utility of using saliva as an alternative sample type. Results: Between the 8th April 2020 and the 30th April 2020, the laboratory tested a total of 1282 HCW for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs. RNA was detected in 54 % of those who reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19, but in only 4% who were asymptomatic. Conclusion: This capability was established rapidly and utilised a cold-chain free methodology, applicable to a wide range of settings, and which can provide surge capacity and support to clinical laboratories facing increasing pressure during periods of national crisis. © 2020 The Author(s)","Birmingham; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Rapid response; SARS-CoV-2; VIASURE qRT-PCR; West Midlands","buffer; reagent; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus RNA; virus RNA; Article; asymptomatic infection; clinical laboratory; cohort analysis; cold chain free method; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis software; diagnostic test; E gene; follow up; genetic analysis; health care personnel; human; in vitro study; major clinical study; n gene; nonhuman; Orf1ab gene; prevalence; priority journal; qualitative analysis; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reproducibility; saliva; sensitivity analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistically significant result; surge capacity; symptom; throat culture; United Kingdom; validation study; virus gene; virus shedding; workflow; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; surge capacity; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Saliva; Surge Capacity; United Kingdom; Workflow","32474371","J.

We surveyed neurosurgeons worldwide to investigate the situation they are experiencing. Methods: A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020, by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into 3 subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data were initially elaborated using SurveyMonkey software. Country-specific data were extracted from the World Health Organization website. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 3.6.3. Results: Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for patients with SARS-CoV-2 (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest radiograph. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), whereas indications were modified for nonurgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%). Conclusions: Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines. Differences in practice might be related to the perception of the pandemic and significant differences in the health systems.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to summarize the available evidence on the efficacy of nanoscale materials against coronaviruses in vitro and in animal models. PubMed, Scopus and Wiley Online Library databases were searched up to 4 March 2020. Studies that developed the efficacy of nanoscale materials against coronaviruses were included. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics and assessed risk of bias and applicability in the included studies. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the overall inhibition efficacy of nanoscale materials against coronaviruses. A total of 21 studies were identified. Positive association was found between efficacy of nanoscale materials and coronaviruses in vitro and in animal models. The inhibition efficacy of nanoscale materials against coronavirus in vitro and in animal models were 1.84 (95% CI: 1.57, 2.15) and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.36, 2.02), respectively. Results of subgroup analysis of selected studies revealed that the nanoscale materials with spherical morphology were found to be more antiviral activity than the other morphologies against Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Using systematic review and meta-analysis, our results indicate that nanoscale materials are positive affect against coronaviruses.

The effect of a strategy of HD with cohort isolation'separate dialysis sessions for close contacts of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)'on the prevention of secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in HD units is unknown. Methods Our multicenter cohort study of an HD with cohort isolation strategy enrolled close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19, including patients on HD and health care workers in HD units. Close contacts had been identified by epidemiologic investigation and tested negative on an immediate screening test for SARS-CoV-2. Results As of March 14, 11 patients on HD and 7 health care workers from 11 HD centers were diagnosed as having COVID-19. The immediate screening test was performed in 306 people, and among them, 302 close contacts with negative test results were enrolled. HD with cohort isolation was performed among all close contacts for a median of 14 days in seven centers. During cohort isolation, nine patients showed symptoms but tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Two health care workers in the HD units (0.66% of the total group) were diagnosed at the termination test for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The transmission of COVID-19 can be controlled without closure of HD centers by implementing preemptive activities, including early detection with rapid testing, cohort isolation, collaboration between institutions, and continuous monitoring of infection. Our strategy and experience may provide helpful guidance for circumstances involving the rapid spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.

We sought to evaluate the prevalence and etiology of all community acquired viral respiratory infections requiring hospitalization during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on co-infection rates and clinical outcomes. Methods: Over a 10-week period, all admissions to our institution, the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore, were screened for respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 as well as a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens were systematically tested for. Information was collated on clinical outcomes, including requirement for mechanical ventilation and in hospital mortality. Results: One-fifth (19.3%, 736/3807) of hospitalized inpatients with respiratory symptoms had a PCR-proven viral respiratory infection; of which 58.5% (431/736) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 42.2% (311/736) tested positive for other common respiratory viruses. The rate of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4% (6/431); all patients with co-infection had mild disease and stayed in communal settings. The in-hospital mortality rate and proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation was low, at around 1% of patients; these rates were lower than patients with other community-acquired respiratory viruses admitted over the same period (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Even amidst an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, common respiratory viruses still accounted for a substantial proportion of hospitalizations.

Methods: In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. Results: The mean age of patients was 56 ± 13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1–7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis. All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results. Conclusions: Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions. Therefore, possibility of ocular transmission should be considered even in the absence of ocular manifestations. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.",,"adult; Article; body temperature; chill; clinical article; conjunctivitis; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; foreign body; human; intraocular foreign body; lacrimal fluid; male; middle aged; myalgia; nonhuman; nose smear; physical disease by body function; prospective study; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; respiratory failure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; lacrimal fluid; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virology; virus pneumonia; virus RNA; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Tears","32424329","Eye",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085216295

After its arrival in South America in February 2020, the virus has expanded throughout the region, infecting over 900,000 individuals with approximately 41,000 reported deaths to date. In response to the rapidly growing number of cases, a number of different primer-probe sets have been developed. However, despite being highly specific, most of these primer-probe sets are known to exhibit variable sensitivity. Currently, there are more than 300 SARS-CoV2 whole genome sequences deposited in databases from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina. To test how regional viral diversity may impact oligo binding sites and affect test performance, we reviewed all available primer-probe sets targeting the E, N, and RdRp genes against available South American SARS-CoV-2 genomes checking for nucleotide variations in annealing sites. Results from this in silico analysis showed no nucleotide variations on the E-gene target region, in contrast to the N and RdRp genes which showed massive nucleotide variations within oligo binding sites. In lines with previous data, our results suggest that the E-gene stands as the most conserved and reliable target when considering single-gene target testing for molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in South America. © 2020 by the authors. .

A SARS-CoV-2 test was performed upon hospital admission and was negative. After 5 days she underwent radiation therapy on T6 and T11 with single fractions of 8 Gy each. Before treatment a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was performed to check the setup of the patient. Some suspected lung areas of ground glass opacities (GGOs) were clearly visible in the CBCT without any counterpart in the previous computed tomography (CT) simulation scan 3 days before. A new high-quality chest CT scan confirmed the previously suspected GGOs. The exam revealed multiple bilateral areas of subpleural GGOs, which are the primary findings on CT scan in the early phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung infection, in addition to pleural effusions, a finding that may occur as a complication of COVID-19. The patient then urgently repeated the SARS-CoV-2 test, which was positive and confirmed the infection.

A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus; CoV; COVID; Intrinsically disordered protein; Membrane; MERS; Nucleocapsid; SARS; Spread","intrinsically disordered protein; membrane protein; nucleocapsid protein; Article; artificial intelligence; body fluid; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; lower respiratory tract; mathematical model; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; prediction; priority journal; saliva; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus particle; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; body fluid; Coronavirus infection; feces; metabolism; pandemic; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Body Fluids; Coronavirus Infections; Feces; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Saliva; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32244041","Microb.

Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored. Findings: Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%). We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational ‘mask-off’ settings compared to only 3 in workplace ‘mask-on’ settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit). Conclusion: Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19. © 2020 The British Infection Association","Community; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Face mask; SARS-COV-2","BCG vaccine; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; France; Germany; health care facility; health care system; Hong Kong; human; incidence; infection control; Italy; major clinical study; outpatient department; pandemic; population density; respiratory tract disease; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Singapore; social distance; South Korea; Spain; tuberculosis; United Kingdom; United States; virus transmission; workplace; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; protective clothing; public health; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Clothing; Public Health","32335167","J.

With contributions from the leadership of the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), Children's Oncology Group (COG), St Jude Global program, and Childhood Cancer International, we have sought to provide a framework for healthcare teams caring for children with cancer during the pandemic. We anticipate the burden will fall particularly heavily on children, their families, and cancer services in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we have brought together the relevant clinical leads from SIOP Europe, COG, and SIOP-PODC (Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) to focus on the six most curable cancers that are part of the WHO Global Initiative in Childhood Cancer.

The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive.

We present a review of the current literature that details the potential negative consequences of COVID-19–positive donors. The factors we consider include (1) the risk of blood transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) involvement of donor organs, (3) lack of effective therapies, (4) exposure of health care and recovery teams, (5) disease transmission and propagation, and (6) hospital resource utilization. While we acknowledge that transplant fulfills the mission of saving lives, it is imperative to consider the consequences not only to our recipients but also to the community and to health care workers, particularly in the absence of effective preventative or curative therapies.

The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease. He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive. His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment. The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies. Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages. The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance. Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury. Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified. Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients’ with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology. The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease. The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Demyelinating; Infarct; Neuropathology; SARS-CoV-2; White matter","C reactive protein; ferritin; interleukin 6; acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; acute kidney failure; acute respiratory failure; aged; Article; autopsy; axonal injury; bradycardia; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction; case report; cause of death; clinical article; clinical feature; continuous renal replacement therapy; coronary angiography; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; coronary artery occlusion; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; do not resuscitate order; dyspnea; elective surgery; fatigue; ferritin blood level; gas exchange; hemisphere; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; intubation; left anterior descending coronary artery; lung mechanics; macrophage; male; neocortex; neuropathology; oxygen consumption; pleura effusion; postoperative complication; priority journal; prognosis; prone position; respiratory failure; sedation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; subcortex; thoracocentesis; thorax radiography; white matter; white matter lesion; x-ray computed tomography; autopsy; Betacoronavirus; brain; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; neuropathology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Aged; Autopsy; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nervous System Diseases; Neuropathology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32449057","Acta Neuropathol.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085342391

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. Methods: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. Conclusions: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not.

As well as SARS-CoV, SARS CoV-2 uses the ‘Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2’ (ACE2) as a receptor to enter human cells. It was found that ACE2, Angiotensin (1-7) and its MAS receptors are present, over in the lung, also in the testicles, in particular in Leydig and Sertoli cells. A first hypothesis is that the virus could enter the testicle and lead to alterations in testicular functionality. A second hypothesis is that the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor, could cause an excess of ACE2 and give rise to a typical inflammatory response.

This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. Objective: Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. Study design: We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. Results: We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. Conclusion: These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Group testing; Mass population tests; Testing","Article; comparative study; computer simulation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; epitope mapping; false negative result; human; Monte Carlo method; multi stage group testing scheme; polymerase chain reaction; population size; prevalence; priority journal; screening test; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; mass screening; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence","32388468","J.

To take full advantage of the resolution of NGS data, we developed HAplotype PHylodynamics PIPEline (HAPHPIPE), an open-source tool for the de novo and reference-based assembly of viral NGS data, with both consensus sequence assembly and a focus on the quantification of intra-host variation through haplotype reconstruction. We validate and compare the consensus sequence assembly methods of HAPHPIPE to those of two alternative software packages, HyDRA and Geneious, using simulated HIV and empirical HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2 datasets. Our validation methods included read mapping, genetic distance, and genetic diversity metrics. In simulated NGS data, HAPHPIPE generated pol consensus sequences significantly closer to the true consensus sequence than those produced by HyDRA and Geneious and performed comparably to Geneious for HIV gp120 sequences. Furthermore, using empirical data from multiple viruses, we demonstrate that HAPHPIPE can analyze larger sequence datasets due to its greater computational speed. Therefore, we contend that HAPHPIPE provides a more user-friendly platform for users with and without bioinformatics experience to implement current best practices for viral NGS assembly than other currently available options. © 2020 by the authors.

In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20 mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved. © 2020 Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología","COVID-19; Crohn's disease; Inflammatory bowel disease; Pandemic; Ulcerative colitis","acetylsalicylic acid; budesonide; integrin; interleukin derivative; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; steroid; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; gastrointestinal agent; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug mechanism; drug use; human; immunosuppressive treatment; infection risk; inflammatory bowel disease; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; inflammatory bowel disease; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Gastrointestinal Agents; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32536480","Rev.

CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals. A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats. Objective: To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Study design and Results: We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4 × 102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested. To assess the assay's clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market. The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types. Conclusions: This assay can be used for detection and identification of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Emerging; Infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2","genomic RNA; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus DNA; amplicon; Article; assay; Avian infectious bronchitis virus; Bovine coronavirus; Canine coronavirus; conserved sequence; controlled study; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross reaction; gene sequence; human; Human adenovirus C; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus HKU; Human coronavirus NL63; Human coronavirus OC43; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Human respiratory syncytial virus A; Human respiratory syncytial virus B; Human rhinovirus; Influenza A virus; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza B virus; limit of detection; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; Paramyxovirinae; phylogeny; Porcine deltacoronavirus; Porcine respiratory coronavirus; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sanger sequencing; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; virus detection; virus genome; virus pneumonia; virus strain; animal; Betacoronavirus; bird; bird disease; Coronavirus infection; genetic variation; genetics; isolation and purification; pandemic; pig; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; swine disease; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Bird Diseases; Birds; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Genetic Variation; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; SARS Virus; Swine; Swine Diseases","32403008","J.

Within our department, a multidisciplinary tracer team prospectively monitored all patients under investigation, tracking their test status, treatment delays, clinical outcomes, employee exposures, and quarantines. Materials and methods: Prospective cohort tested for SARS-COV-2 infection over 35 consecutive days of the early pandemic (03/19/2020–04/22/2020). Results: A total of 121 Radiation Oncology patients underwent RT-PCR testing during this timeframe. Of the 7 (6%) confirmed-positive cases, 6 patients were admitted (4 warranting intensive care), and 2 died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Radiotherapy was deferred or interrupted for 40 patients awaiting testing. As the median turnaround time for RT-PCR testing decreased from 1.5 (IQR: 1–4) to ≤1-day (P < 0.001), the median treatment delay also decreased from 3.5 (IQR: 1.75–5) to 1 business day (IQR: 1–2) [P < 0.001]. Each patient was an exposure risk to a median of 5 employees (IQR: 3–6.5) through prolonged close contact. During this timeframe, 39 care-team members were quarantined for a median of 3 days (IQR: 2–11), with a peak of 17 employees simultaneously quarantined. Following implementation of a “dual PPE policy,” newly quarantined employees decreased from 2.9 to 0.5 per day. Conclusion: The severe adverse events noted among these confirmed-positive cases support the notion that cancer patients are vulnerable to COVID-19. Active tracking, rapid diagnosis, and aggressive source control can mitigate the adverse effects on treatment delays, workforce incapacitation, and ideally outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Isolation precautions; Nasopharyngeal swab; Pandemic; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2","bevacizumab; cisplatin; immunological antineoplastic agent; ipilimumab; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase inhibitor; nivolumab; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; adverse event; aged; Article; brain metastasis; breast cancer; cancer patient; central nervous system cancer; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; death; digestive system cancer; dyspnea; endometrium cancer; fatty acid desaturation; female; female genital tract cancer; head and neck cancer; hospital admission; human; leiomyosarcoma; lung adenocarcinoma; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; melanoma; metastatic breast cancer; occupational hazard; pandemic; pineal body tumor; priority journal; prospective study; quarantine; radiation necrosis; radiation oncology; real time polymerase chain reaction; rectum cancer; sarcoma; screening; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stereotactic body radiation therapy; therapy delay; thorax cancer; turnaround time; urogenital tract cancer; vagina carcinoma; vulnerable population; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; pandemic; procedures; radiation oncology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Radiation Oncology; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","32474129","Radiother.

This study investigates whether Greek citizens (N = 3359) take the necessary precautions to prevent developing the COVID-19 disease, and it segments them based on homogenous behavior groups. Lastly, it provides communication techniques that should be implemented, targeting each citizen segment for a long-term COVID-19 free country. Data analysis revealed the extent of the applied precaution measures. The ones most applied by citizens were to avoid non-mandatory transportation, contact with individuals with respiratory symptoms, and individuals of high risk for severe illness (vulnerable groups). On the other hand, the least applied measures are daily checks of body temperature, monitoring for fever, cough, or dyspnea, use of a face mask when in public places, or when using public transportation. Additionally, cluster analysis revealed five groups of citizens based on self-reported behavior, namely, the Meticulous Proactive Citizens, the Self-isolated Citizens, the Cautious Citizens, the Occasionally Cautious Citizens, and the Unconcerned Citizens.

Methods: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. Results: The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. Conclusion: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic. © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated. Methods: A cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to February 29 was retrospectively analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR, were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between the baseline NLR and in-hospital all-cause death. A sensitivity analysis was performed by converting NLR from a continuous variable to a categorical variable according to tertile. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. Results: 245 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analyses, and the in-hospital mortality was 13.47%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was 8% higher risk of in-hospital mortality for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.0147). Compared with patients in the lowest tertile, the NLR of patients in the highest tertile had a 15.04-fold higher risk of death (OR = 16.04; 95% CI, 1.14 to 224.95; P = 0.0395) after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, the fully adjusted OR for mortality was 1.10 in males for each unit increase of NLR (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.19; P = 0.016).

Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1–2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusion: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chest CT scan; COVID-19; Immunochromatographic assay; SARS-CoV-2","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; adult; aged; antibody detection; Article; asymptomatic infection; blood sampling; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; diarrhea; dyspnea; false positive result; female; fever; hospital admission; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; immunoassay; immunoglobulin blood level; major clinical study; malaise; male; nasopharynx; nose smear; oxygen saturation; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; tachypnea; thorax radiography; throat culture; Betacoronavirus; blood; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; immunoassay; immunology; Japan; laboratory technique; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; thorax; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thorax; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32387968","J.

Material and methods: We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from 14 March to 14 April 2020. Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected. An analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed to compare the medians of laboratory parameters. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables. A correspondence analysis was used to explore associations between variables. Results: A total of 60 pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5% each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%). Forty-one women (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 because of disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 women (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics, and tocilizumab. No renal or cardiac failures or maternal deaths were reported. Lymphopenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (59%) were observed in the early stages of the disease. Median CRP, D-dimer, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were elevated. High CRP and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe pneumonia. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be the most sensitive marker for disease improvement (relative risk 6.65; 95% CI 4.1-5.9). During the study period, 18 of the women (78%) delivered vaginally. All newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and none of them were infected during breastfeeding. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in placental tissue. Conclusions: Most of the pregnant women with COVID-19 had a favorable clinical course. However, one-third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status. CRP and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe pneumonia and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically. Seventy-eight percent of the women had a vaginal delivery. No vertical or horizontal transmissions were diagnosed in the neonates during labor or breastfeeding. © 2020 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","breastfeeding; coronavirus 2; coronavirus disease-2019; labor; newborn; pregnancy; severe acute respiratory syndrome; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vertical transmission","antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; C reactive protein; cobicistat; D dimer; darunavir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; paracetamol; ritonavir; tocilizumab; C reactive protein; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; adult; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; breast feeding; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease course; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; female; fever; hospital admission; human; laboratory test; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; newborn; newborn screening; outcome assessment; palliative therapy; pandemic; placenta tissue; pneumonia; pregnant woman; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thrombocytopenia; urea nitrogen blood level; vaginal delivery; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; obstetric delivery; pandemic; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; procedures; Spain; symptom assessment; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Breast Feeding; C-Reactive Protein; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnancy Outcome; Spain; Symptom Assessment","32441332","Acta Obstet.

In the acute phase, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aerodigestive tract limited activities in the gastroenterology clinic and procedures to emergencies only. Motility and function testing was interrupted and as we enter the recovery phase, restarting these procedures requires a safety-focused approach with adequate infection prevention for patients and healthcare professionals. Methods: We summarized knowledge on the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aerodigestive tract and the risk of spread with motility and functional testing. We surveyed 39 European centers documenting how the pandemic affected activities and which measures they are considering for restarting these measurements. We propose recommendations based on current knowledge as applied in our center. Results: Positioning of catheters for gastrointestinal motility tests carries a concern for aerosol-borne infection of healthcare workers. The risk is low with breath tests. The surveyed centers stopped almost all motility and function tests from the second half of March. The speed of restarting and the safety measures taken varied highly. Conclusions and Inferences: Based on these findings, we provided recommendations and practical relevant information for motility and function test procedures in the COVID-19 pandemic era, to guarantee a high-quality patient care with adequate infection prevention. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","breath test; COVID-19; manometry; pH impedance monitoring","anorectal pressure; Article; breath analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; esophagus manometry; Europe; function test; gastric pH monitoring; gastrointestinal motility; gastrointestinal tract function; health care personnel; health care survey; human; infection risk; occupational safety; pandemic; priority journal; safety procedure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; convalescence; Coronavirus infection; gastroenterology; gastrointestinal motility; multicenter study; pandemic; patient care; physiology; practice guideline; procedures; protective clothing; questionnaire; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Europe; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Motility; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Protective Clothing; Recovery of Function; Surveys and Questionnaires","32478910","Neurogastroenterol.

Design: Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. Setting: Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. Patient(s): Not applicable (focus was on previously generated gene and protein expression data). Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Identification of cell types coexpressing the key angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes and proteins as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Result(s): On the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in nonhuman primate ovarian tissue was found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but coexpression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent. There was general agreement between publicly available bulk RNA and protein datasets in terms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in testis, ovary, endometrial, and placental cells. Conclusion(s): These analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to have long-term effects on male and female reproductive function. Although the results cannot be considered definitive, they imply that procedures in which oocytes are collected and fertilized in vitro are associated with very little risk of viral transmission from gametes to embryos and may indeed have the potential to minimize exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types to infection in comparison with natural conception. © 2020 American Society for Reproductive Medicine","COVID-19; fertility; IVF; ovary; testis","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; bone morphogenetic protein 15; bsg protein; cathepsin L; messenger RNA; proteinase; RNA; transcriptome; transmembrane serine protease 2; unclassified drug; zona pellucida glycoprotein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein, human; transcriptome; animal tissue; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cumulus cell; embryo; endometrium cell; female; female fertility; gene expression level; germ cell; human; human cell; human tissue; Macaca fascicularis; macrophage; male; male fertility; nonhuman; ovary follicle development; ovary tissue; placental cell line; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; RNA extraction; RNA sequencing; Sertoli cell; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single cell RNA seq; spermatid; spermatocyte; spermatogonium; testis; virus entry; adolescent; adult; animal; Betacoronavirus; biosynthesis; cell line; Coronavirus infection; cytology; fertility; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; ovary; pandemic; physiology; pregnancy; procedures; proteomics; reproduction; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Cell Line; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Fertility; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Humans; Macaca fascicularis; Male; Ovary; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Proteomics; Reproduction; Serine Endopeptidases; Testis; Transcriptome; Virus Internalization; Young Adult","32622411","Fertil.

We herein report our initial experience with solid organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two centers during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in New York City. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU admission, intubation or death). Ninety patients were analyzed with a median age of 57 years. Forty-six were kidney recipients, 17 lung, 13 liver, 9 heart, and 5 dual-organ transplants. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%). Twenty-two (24%) had mild, 41 (46%) moderate, and 27 (30%) severe disease. Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required non-rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids. Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged. In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID-19 appear to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to undercounting of mild/asymptomatic cases.

Objective: We sought to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods: Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe, and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. Results: Levels of 14 cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IFN-γ–induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, hepatocyte growth factor, monokine-induced gamma IFN, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the 5 cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome. Furthermore, IFN-γ–induced protein 10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 were excellent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of the 2 cytokines showed the biggest area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristics calculations with a value of 0.99. Conclusions: In this study, we report biomarkers that are highly associated with disease severity and progression of COVID-19.

We here describe the course and the outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients undergoing treatment with calcineurin inhibitors. In this monocentric cohort study, data were collected from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy up to April 28th 2020. Patients were followed at our hospital for solid organ transplantation or systemic rheumatic disorders (RMDs) and were on calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based therapy. Selected patients were referred from the North of Italy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical course of COVID-19 in this setting. We evaluated 385 consecutive patients (220 males, 57%; median age 61 years, IQR 48–69); 331 (86%) received solid organ transplantation and 54 (14%) had a RMD. CNIs were the only immunosuppressant administered in 47 patients (12%). We identified 14 (4%) COVID-19 patients, all transplanted, mainly presenting with fever (86%) and diarrhea (71%). Twelve patients were hospitalized and two of them died, both with severe comorbidities. No patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or infectious complications. The surviving 10 patients are now fully recovered. The clinical course of COVID-19 patients on CNIs is generally mild, and the risk of superinfection seems low. © 2020 by the authors.

The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID-19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs). Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia. This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs.

During an outbreak of SARS-COV-2 with community transmission, our institution used an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers (HCWs).Methods: Our strategy comprised 3 key components: (1) enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's staff clinic for monitoring; (2) conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19; and (3) outbreak investigation and management.Results: Over a 16-week surveillance period, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs with ARI symptoms. Two of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with intrahospital HCW-HCW transmission; we also detected 1 family cluster and 2 clusters among HCWs who shared accommodation. No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic.Conclusions: An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs. Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure. © 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods: We collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (N = 59; diagnosis from February 2 through February 29, 2020),and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and 3 Chinese databases through March 11, 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model. Results: Among the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA. Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P =.02). The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10 copies per milliliter in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10 copies per milliliter in patients without diarrhea (P =.06). In a meta-analysis of 60 studies comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3–24.5); 11.8% of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1–29.1), and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9–36.7). In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3–57.9); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6–85.1). Conclusions: In an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% patients, even in stool collected after respiratory samples had negative test results. Health care workers should therefore exercise caution in collecting fecal samples or performing endoscopic procedures in patients with COVID-19, even during patient recovery. © 2020 AGA Institute","Fecal-to-Oral Transmission; PRISMA; SARS; Viral Persistence","virus RNA; virus RNA; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; disease severity; dyspnea; feces microflora; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; Hong Kong; hospital admission; human; loss of appetite; nausea; nonhuman; pediatric patient; pregnant woman; prevalence; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus load; virus shedding; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; diarrhea; disease transmission; feces; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gastrointestinal tract; genetics; infection control; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; meta analysis; pandemic; pathogenicity; prevention and control; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Diarrhea; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Feces; Gastrointestinal Tract; Hong Kong; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; RNA, Viral; Viral Load","32251668","Gastroenterology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088263503

Methods: Preoperative patients had one or two nasopharyngeal swabs, depending on low or high risk of viral transmission. Positive tests were repeated. Results: Forty-three of 52 patients required two or more preoperative tests. Four (9.3%) had discrepant results (positive/negative). One of these left the coronavirus disease (COVID) unit against medical advice despite an orbital abscess, with unknown true disease status. The remaining 3 of 42 (7.1%) had negative repeat RT-PCR. Although ultimately considered falsepositives, one was sent to a COVID unit postoperatively and two had urgent surgery delayed.

Conclusions: This study, with a relatively large sample size, focused on the duration of viral shedding and related factors in patients with COVID-19, outside of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantining infected patients. © 2020 The Author(s)","2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Changsha; Risk factor; Viral shedding","antibiotic agent; glucocorticoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; ribavirin; virus RNA; adult; Article; artificial ventilation; body mass; body temperature; China; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; follow up; hospital admission; human; laboratory test; length of stay; major clinical study; male; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus load; virus shedding; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; hospitalization; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; pandemic; pathophysiology; time factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Body Temperature; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Virus Shedding; Young Adult","32425636","Int.

Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"antiinflammatory agent; cytokine; glucocorticoid; pioglitazone; tocilizumab; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cardiovascular risk; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; human; inflammation; insulin resistance; lung injury; neurologic disease; nonhuman; protein synthesis inhibition; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment duration","32344313","Med.

We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings: 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation: If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

Aims: To report the clinical characteristics, including gastrointestinal symptoms, of COVID-19 in IBD patients, and to assess the risk of COVID-19 in IBD. Methods: This case series included consecutive IBD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Age-adjusted cumulative incidences were compared with the general population in the Madrid region. Results: Through April 8, 12 of 1918 IBD patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The average age was 52 years, 75% of the patients were female and 58.3% had Crohn’s disease. Seven patients (58%) were on maintenance treatment with immunomodulators/biologics, of these four with combined therapy (33%). Eight patients (66%) required hospitalisation (one intensive care unit admission, and two deaths), and four patients were isolated at home. Nine patients had diarrhoea ranging between 4 and 10 loose stools per day (mean 5.4, SD 1.6). In five patients (42%) diarrhoea was a presenting symptom. In two patients, diarrhoea was the only symptom at debut. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 6.2 per 1000 IBD patients. IBD patients had a lower adjusted incidence ratio of COVID-19 (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.77; P < 0.001), and a similar associated mortality ratio (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84-1.06; P = 0.36), compared with the general population. Conclusions: IBD patients do not have an increased risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality compared with the general population.

There are also other consequences that have globally affected many millions at other levels, namely: Societal, political, economic, and cultural. This study aims to survey alcohol drinking throughout the pandemic so as to investigate those factors considered most relevant; i.e., sociodem-ographic and clinical. A longitudinal study was designed. The first (or initial) stage was completed between April 10–20 2020 on 443 subjects during the enforcement of the “Lockdown” in Poland. The second stage will be due in June 2020. As well as an in-house questionnaire, the study used: The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Brief COPE Inventory (Mini COPE). Alcohol was the most commonly used psychoactive substance (73%) identified. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic, with 16% actually drinking less, whilst 14% did so more. The former group was significantly younger than the latter. Amongst the stress-related coping strategies, it was found that current alcohol drinkers were significantly less able to find anything positive about the pandemic situation (positive reframing) and were mentally less able to cope. Those drinking more now were found to have been drinking more intensively before the pandemic started. © 2020 by the authors.

Objective: We sought to analyze the immune status of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 in the third trimester. Methods: Along with collecting the clinical data from 51 newborns and their respective mothers, we recorded the immunophenotypes and cytokine and immunoglobulin levels of the newborns. Results: None of the 51 newborns showed fever or respiratory distress during hospitalization. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid in pharyngeal swabs was negative. Except for the low level of CD16-CD56 cells, the count and proportion of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 were all in the normal range. Moreover, the serum IgG and IgM levels were within the normal range, whereas IL-6 showed increased levels. There was no correlation between maternal COVID-19 duration and the lymphocyte subsets or cytokine levels (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels and CD16-CD56 cells. One (1.96%) infant with an extremely elevated IL-6 concentration developed necrotizing enterocolitis in the third week after birth, and the remaining 50 infants did not show abnormal symptoms through the end of the follow-up period. Conclusions: COVID-19 in the third trimester did not significantly affect the cellular and humoral immunity of the fetus, and there was no evidence that the differentiation of lymphocyte subsets was seriously unbalanced. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","COVID-19; lymphocyte subsets and cytokines; Newborn; pregnant women; third-trimester","CD16 antigen; CD19 antigen; CD3 antigen; CD4 antigen; CD56 antigen; CD8 antigen; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; nucleic acid; procalcitonin; tumor necrosis factor; Article; cellular distribution; China; clinical feature; clinical study; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease duration; false positive result; female; fever; follow up; hospitalization; human; immune status; immunocompetent cell; immunoglobulin blood level; immunophenotyping; lymphocyte subpopulation; major clinical study; male; mother; necrotizing enterocolitis; newborn; pneumonia; pregnant woman; priority journal; respiratory distress; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; third trimester pregnancy; throat culture; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prenatal exposure; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Lymphocyte Subsets; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects","32437740","J.

As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Methods and findings Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 ± 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 ± 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown. © 2020 Pinotti et al.

Given the overwhelming demand on facility capacity, the impact on all health care sectors has to be addressed. Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units, and follow-up facilities. The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of health care capacities. In addition, the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addressing these crucial questions, transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance, derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies. Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated. A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending nonurgent transplant procedures and living donation programs. Systematic polymerase chain reaction-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended. Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis.

The target of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive cells. ACE2 is present in the salivary gland duct epithelium, and thus it could be the target of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-related animal model experiments show that it can infect the epithelial cells on the salivary gland duct in Chinese rhesus macaques by targeting ACE2. Clinical studies confirmed that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could be detected in saliva of human patients. We hypothesize that the infection of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV will lead to inflammatory pathological lesions in patients’ target organs, and possibly inflammatory lesions in salivary glands. 2019-nCoV may cause acute sialoadenitis in the acute phase of infection. After the acute phase, chronic sialoadenitis may be caused by fibrosis repairment. Although there was no direct evidence to prove this, the available indirect evidence indicates a high probability of our hypothesis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2019-nCoV; Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Clinical character; Saliva; Sialadenitis","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; acinar cell; acute disease; Article; blood pressure regulation; China; chronic disease; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; epithelium cell; human; inflammation; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; saliva level; salivary gland; salivary gland duct; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sialoadenitis; target organ",,"Med.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation. © 2020 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",,"aged; Betacoronavirus; cerebrovascular accident; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; female; head injury; human; male; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; very elderly; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Craniocerebral Trauma; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stroke; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32439651","AJNR Am J Neuroradiol",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087113203

Pneumonia, a major effect of COVID-19, needs to be urgently diagnosed along with its underlying reasons. In this paper, deep learning aided automated COVID-19 and other pneumonia detection schemes are proposed utilizing a small amount of COVID-19 chest X-rays. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, named as CovXNet, is proposed that utilizes depthwise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. Since the chest X-ray images corresponding to COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other traditional pneumonias have significant similarities, at first, a large number of chest X-rays corresponding to normal and (viral/bacterial) pneumonia patients are used to train the proposed CovXNet. Learning of this initial training phase is transferred with some additional fine-tuning layers that are further trained with a smaller number of chest X-rays corresponding to COVID-19 and other pneumonia patients. In the proposed method, different forms of CovXNets are designed and trained with X-ray images of various resolutions and for further optimization of their predictions, a stacking algorithm is employed. Finally, a gradient-based discriminative localization is integrated to distinguish the abnormal regions of X-ray images referring to different types of pneumonia. Extensive experimentations using two different datasets provide very satisfactory detection performance with accuracy of 97.4% for COVID/Normal, 96.9% for COVID/Viral pneumonia, 94.7% for COVID/Bacterial pneumonia, and 90.2% for multiclass COVID/normal/Viral/Bacterial pneumonias. Hence, the proposed schemes can serve as an efficient tool in the current state of COVID-19 pandemic.

People’s self-efficacy to adopt preventive behaviours to avoid COVID-19 contagion and spread should be studied. The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test the COVID-19 prevention, detection, and home-management self-efficacy scale (COVID-19-SES). We conducted an observational cross-sectional study. Six-hundred and seventy-eight people participated in the study. Data were collected between March and May 2020. The COVID-19-SES’ validity (content, criterion, and construct), reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability), and legibility were studied. The COVID-19-SES’ reliability was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.906; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.754). The COVID-19-SES showed good content validity (scale’s content validity index = 0.92) and good criterion validity when the participants’ results on the COVID-19-SES were compared to their general self-efficacy (r = 0.38; p < 0.001). Construct validity analysis revealed that the COVID-19-SES’ three-factor structure explained 52.12% of the variance found and it was congruent with the World Health Organisation’s recommendations to prevent COVID-19 contagion and spread. Legibility analysis showed that the COVID-19-SES is easy to read and understand by laypeople.

This paper applies an exploratory time-series analysis to the evolution of the disease in Greece, which currently suggests a success story of COVID-19 management. The proposed method builds on a recent conceptualization of detecting connective communities in a time-series and develops a novel spline regression model where the knot vector is determined by the community detection in the complex network.

However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Findings: The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22–64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5–4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22–67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18–68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0–42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. Interpretation: Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission. Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of APs (39.0, interquartile range (IQR) 37.5–39.5) was significantly higher than that of APIs (34.5, IQR 32.2–37.0), indicating a lower viral load in APs. However, the duration of viral shedding remained similar in the two groups (7 days, IQR 5–14 days vs. 8 days, IQR 5–16 days). The study findings demonstrated that although APs with COVID-19 have a lower viral load, they still have certain period of viral shedding, which suggests the possibility of transmission during their asymptomatic period.

Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiation therapy with clinical and imaging features that overlap with those of COVID-19; however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19–associated lung injury. We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results. Methods and Materials: The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed. The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on March 1, 2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing. Results: Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed. Three out of 4 patients tested positive for COVID-19. All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Two patients had a fever, of whom only 1 tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients started on an empirical high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization. Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field. Conclusions: As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention. We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empirical corticosteroids and for careful attention to be paid to chest CT imaging to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients. © 2020 The Author(s)",,"atezolizumab; carboplatin; cisplatin; corticosteroid; etoposide; pemetrexed; RNA; salbutamol; adult; aged; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; case report; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; clinical assessment; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; coughing; decreased appetite; deterioration; disease course; drug megadose; dyspnea; epidemic; female; fever; hospitalization; human; hypoxia; lung adenocarcinoma; lung injury; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pandemic; priority journal; radiation dose fractionation; radiation field; radiation pneumonia; re-irradiation; small cell lung cancer; symptom; thorax",,"Adv.

Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals’ precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (−ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chest CT; Convolutional neural networks; Coronavirus; Differential evolution; Multi-objective","Article; classification algorithm; computer assisted tomography; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; differential evolution algorithm; feature extraction; human; multiobjective evolutionary algorithm; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; false negative result; false positive result; laboratory technique; lung; pandemic; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; False Negative Reactions; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32337662","Eur.

However, little is known about the presentation of patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care, particularly those who used 911 emergency medical services (EMS). Objective: To describe patient characteristics and prehospital presentation of patients with COVID-19 cared for by EMS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 124 patients who required 911 EMS care for COVID-19 in King County, Washington, a large metropolitan region covering 2300 square miles with 2.2 million residents in urban, suburban, and rural areas, between February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Test results were available a median (interquartile range) of 5 (3-9) days after the EMS encounter. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of clinical characteristics, symptoms, examination signs, and EMS impression and care. Results: Of the 775 confirmed COVID-19 cases in King County, EMS responded to 124 (16.0%), with a total of 147 unique 911 encounters. The mean (SD) age was 75.7 (13.2) years, 66 patients (53.2%) were women, 47 patients (37.9%) had 3 or more chronic health conditions, and 57 patients (46.0%) resided in a long-term care facility. Based on EMS evaluation, 43 of 147 encounters (29.3%) had no symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Based on individual examination findings, fever, tachypnea, or hypoxia were only present in a limited portion of cases, as follows: 43 of 84 encounters (51.2%), 42 of 131 (32.1%), and 60 of 112 (53.6%), respectively. Advanced care was typically not required, although in 24 encounters (16.3%), patients received care associated with aerosol-generating procedures. As of June 1, 2020, mortality among the study cohort was 52.4% (65 patients). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that screening based on conventional COVID-19 symptoms or corresponding examination findings of febrile respiratory illness may not possess the necessary sensitivity for early diagnostic suspicion, at least in the prehospital emergency setting. The findings have potential implications for early identification of COVID-19 and effective strategies to mitigate infectious risk during emergency care.",,"aged; Betacoronavirus; cohort analysis; Coronavirus infection; coughing; dyspnea; emergency health service; female; fever; human; hypoxia; laboratory technique; long term care; male; middle aged; multiple chronic conditions; oxygen therapy; pandemic; respiratory care; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tachypnea; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Washington; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Dyspnea; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Fever; Humans; Hypoxia; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Chronic Conditions; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Therapy; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tachypnea; Washington","32639570","JAMA Netw Open",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088208807

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by distributing online questionnaires to 2430 adult members (> 18 years) of two user panels consisting of people with diabetes who have volunteered to share information about their life with diabetes. The questionnaire included items on COVID-19-specific worries as well as such worries related to diabetes, sociodemographic and health status, social relations, diabetes-specific social support, diabetes distress and changes in diabetes-specific behaviours. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. Results: People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes. More than half were worried about being overly affected due to diabetes if infected with COVID-19, about one-third about being characterized as a risk group due to diabetes and not being able to manage diabetes if infected. Logistic regressions showed that being female, having type 1 diabetes, diabetes complications and diabetes distress, feeling isolated and lonely, and having changed diabetes behaviours were associated with being more worried about COVID-19 and diabetes. Conclusion: People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes which is associated with poorer psychosocial health. These worries should be addressed through support targeting specific questions and needs of individuals with diabetes as well as frequent updates on new knowledge regarding COVID-19 and diabetes. © 2020 Diabetes UK",,"adult; aged; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; demography; Denmark; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; distress syndrome; female; health care access; health status; high risk population; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; loneliness; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; online monitoring; pandemic; patient worry; psychological aspect; questionnaire; secondary health care; social interaction; social isolation; social media; social psychology; social support; socioeconomics; UCLA Loneliness Scale; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diabetic complication; distress syndrome; fear; health behavior; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; psychology; quality of life; risk factor; sex factor; social support; statistical model; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Denmark; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fear; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Logistic Models; Loneliness; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Social Support; Young Adult","32392380","Diabet.

The aim of this study was to look for the warning index in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated 43 adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients). A comparison of the hematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6), d-dimer (d-D), glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (P <.05). The optimal threshold and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of IL-6 were 24.3 and 0.795 µg/L, respectively, while those of d-D were 0.28 and 0.750 µg/L, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of IL-6 combined with d-D was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and d-D tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and d-D by parallel test in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%. IL-6 and d-D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","d-dimer; diagnostic utility; IL-6; the severe COVID-19","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; creatinine; cystatin; D dimer; fibrinogen; glucose; interleukin 6; procalcitonin; uric acid; biological marker; C reactive protein; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; fibrinogen; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; activated partial thromboplastin time; adult; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; clinical laboratory; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; hematological parameters; human; human cell; lymphocyte count; male; middle aged; mononuclear cell; neutrophil count; prediction; predictive value; prothrombin time; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; thrombin time; aged; area under the curve; Betacoronavirus; blood; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; genetics; glucose blood level; laboratory technique; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; procedures; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Area Under Curve; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; C-Reactive Protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Fibrinogen; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Thrombin Time","32181911","J.

Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB). Methods: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. Results: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. Conclusion: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider. © 2020 Diabetes India","Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Angiotensin-receptor blockers; Comorbidities; COVID-19; Hypertension","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; vitronectin; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; Article; cardiovascular disease; clinical outcome; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; drug effect; human; hypertension; mortality rate; nonhuman; priority journal; prognosis; protein function; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; systematic review; animal; Betacoronavirus; cardiovascular disease; China; Coronavirus infection; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; hypertension; Medline; mortality; mouse; pandemic; physiology; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; virus pneumonia; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Hypertension; Mice; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; PubMed; Renin-Angiotensin System","32283499","Diabetes Metab.

Aim: To review the studies reporting gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19. Results: Fifteen articles (2,800 patients) were identified. Gastrointestinal symptom frequency varied from 3.0% to 39.6% and included diarrhea (7.5%), náusea (4.5%), anorexia (4.4%), vomiting (1.3%), abdominal pain (0.5%), and belching/reflux (0.3%). Those symptoms can be the first manifestation of COVID-19, but whether they reflect a better or worse prognosis, is controversial. The potential relation of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor in the digestive tract as an entry route for the virus is discussed. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal symptoms may be common in COVID-19, in some cases appearing as the first manifestation, even before fever and respiratory symptoms.

In obstetrics, there is little information available to guide practice. As new data emerge, the spectrum of initial presenting symptoms has expanded from fever, cough, and dyspnea to gastrointestinal and other symptoms in both pregnant and non-pregnant patients. Case: A 36-year-old woman, G4P2, at 33 weeks of gestation presented very early in the COVID-19 course with four days of cough and fever, without recent travel or known exposure. She appeared well, with stable vital signs, and was sent home to self-quarantine after a specimen for COVID-19 testing was collected. Two days later, she presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Conclusion: To date, no cases of human pancreatitis have been identified as related to a COVID-19 infection, although multiple other gastrointestinal symptoms have been described. Given the lack of other etiology, we consider the possibility that patient's acute pancreatitis could be secondary to COVID-19 infection. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus 2019; COVID-19; Pancreatitis; Pregnancy; Type 1 diabetes mellitus","dicloxacillin; hemoglobin A1c; paracetamol; abdominal pain; adult; Article; asthma; body mass; breast tenderness; breathing rate; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetic ketoacidosis; dyspnea; epigastric pain; female; fever; gastroenteritis; gestational age; glucose blood level; heart rate; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; hypoxia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; mastitis; maternal obesity; myalgia; nausea; oxygen saturation; pancreatitis; polymerase chain reaction; preeclampsia; pregnant woman; priority journal; quarantine; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shared decision making; thorax radiography; urinalysis; vital sign; vomiting",,"Case Rep.

Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Methods: This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression. Results: The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (β = 43 146; p = 0.056). Conclusions: Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19 prevalence; Social distancing; South Korea; Traffic level; VDS","Article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; human; isolation; major clinical study; prevalence; quasi experimental study; South Korea; trend study; Betacoronavirus; car driving; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Automobile Driving; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Republic of Korea","32417247","Int.

Imaging revealed findings consistent with meningoencephalitis complicated by intracerebral hematoma and subdural hematoma. The latter was surgically evacuated after it became chronic and evidence of coronavirus was found in the fluid. Our experience confirms that neurological complications might be a likely event in COVID-19. Although uncommon, the possible occurrence of meningoencephalitis should be kept in mind by physicians involved in the management of COVID-19 patients.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv from 1 January to 30 April 2020, using subject headings or subheadings combined with text words for the concepts of covid-19 and serological tests for covid-19. Eligibility criteria and data analysis Eligible studies measured sensitivity or specificity, or both of a covid-19 serological test compared with a reference standard of viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Studies were excluded with fewer than five participants or samples. Risk of bias was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using random effects bivariate meta-analyses. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was overall sensitivity and specificity, stratified by method of serological testing (enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), or chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs)) and immunoglobulin class (IgG, IgM, or both). Secondary outcomes were stratum specific sensitivity and specificity within subgroups defined by study or participant characteristics, including time since symptom onset. Results 5016 references were identified and 40 studies included. 49 risk of bias assessments were carried out (one for each population and method evaluated). High risk of patient selection bias was found in 98% (48/49) of assessments and high or unclear risk of bias from performance or interpretation of the serological test in 73% (36/49). Only 10% (4/40) of studies included outpatients. Only two studies evaluated tests at the point of care. For each method of testing, pooled sensitivity and specificity were not associated with the immunoglobulin class measured. The pooled sensitivity of ELISAs measuring IgG or IgM was 84.3% (95% confidence interval 75.6% to 90.9%), of LFIAs was 66.0% (49.3% to 79.3%), and of CLIAs was 97.8% (46.2% to 100%). In all analyses, pooled sensitivity was lower for LFIAs, the potential point-of-care method. Pooled specificities ranged from 96.6% to 99.7%. Of the samples used for estimating specificity, 83% (10 465/12 547) were from populations tested before the epidemic or not suspected of having covid-19. Among LFIAs, pooled sensitivity of commercial kits (65.0%, 49.0% to 78.2%) was lower than that of non-commercial tests (88.2%, 83.6% to 91.3%). Heterogeneity was seen in all analyses. Sensitivity was higher at least three weeks after symptom onset (ranging from 69.9% to 98.9%) compared with within the first week (from 13.4% to 50.3%). Conclusion Higher quality clinical studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for covid-19 are urgently needed. Currently, available evidence does not support the continued use of existing point-of-care serological tests. Study registration PROSPERO CRD42020179452. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

It is the most densely populated region in the world, with a population of 667400 and a total land area of 32.9 square kilometers in 2019. Since the first case diagnosed on January 22, 2020, there was a total of 45 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Macao, of which 43 patients (96%) were imported cases. To date, all patients had been discharged successfully from Centro Hospitalar Conde de Sao Januario, a designated hospital to manage all COVID-19 patients in Macao. Eventually, no patient died, and no local community outbreak was noted. This opinion review describes the underlying factors that could have contributed to the successful experience in Macao SAR, China, which include the following: (1) Early implementation of containment measures; (2) Large-scale quarantine using hotel rooms to reduce the risk of a local outbreak; and (3) Multidisciplinary co-operation and transparency of information to the public. Although the successful experience in Macao SAR, China, may not be generalized to other regions, it should not be unreasonable to be well prepared with sufficient logistic support to conduct timely containment and early detection of episodic cases to prevent the backsliding of COVID-19 outbreak. ©The Author(s) 2020.","Containment; COVID-19; Macao; Outbreak; Quarantine; RNA test","virus RNA; Article; asymptomatic infection; community acquired infection; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; government; high risk population; human; incubation time; nasopharynx; quarantine; saliva; serodiagnosis; tourism; travel; viral RNA test",,"World J.

The diagnostic value of CT is unclear. We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre—Wuhan, China. Materials and methods: Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. Results: 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). Conclusions: Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus infections; Lung diseases; Pneumonia; Tomography; X-ray computed","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic radiologist; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; epidemic; false negative result; fatigue; female; fever; headache; human; intermethod comparison; interrater reliability; leukocytosis; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; male; myalgia; priority journal; quarantine; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; repeat procedure; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; sore throat; staff training; symptom; thorax; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; early diagnosis; isolation and purification; lung; middle aged; observer variation; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Coronavirus Infections; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32364959","Respir.

Methods: Our article comprehensively searched PubMed, FMRS, EMbase, CNKI, WanFang databases, and VIP databases to collect literatures about the CT imaging features of COVID-19 from 1 January to 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and then, this meta-analysis was performed by using Stata12.0 software. Results: A total of 34 retrospective studies involving a total of 4121 patients with COVID-19 were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that most patients presented bilateral lung involvement (73.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 65.9%-81.1%) or multilobar involvement (67.3%, 95% CI: 54.8%-78.7%) and just little patients showed normal CT findings (8.4%). We found that the most common changes in lesion density were ground-glass opacities (68.1%, 95% CI: 56.9%-78.2%). Other changes in density included air bronchogram sign (44.7%), crazy-paving pattern (35.6%), and consolidation (32.0%). Patchy (40.3%), spider web sign (39.5%), cord-like (36.8%), and nodular (20.5%) were common lesion shapes in patients with COVID-19. Pleural thickening (27.1%) was found in some patients. Lymphadenopathy (5.4%) and pleural effusion (5.3%) were rare. Conclusion: The lung lesions of patients with COVID-19 were mostly bilateral lungs or multilobar involved. The most common chest CT findings were patchy and ground-glass opacities. Some patients had air bronchogram, spider web sign, and cord-like.

Previous studies have paid more attention to the epidemic situation of COVID-19 and patient diagnosis and treatment. Close attention also should be paid to the discharged patients. Surprisingly, a previous follow-up reported that some patients’ nucleic acid retest results were positive again after discharge [3].

Study Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Single-institution study conducted within the Division of Otolaryngology at the Yale School of Medicine. Subjects and Methods: Data on all outpatient appointments within the Division of Otolaryngology were obtained from administrative records of billing and scheduling from March 16 to April 10, 2020. For comparison, a corresponding period from 2019 was also utilized. Results: Of 5913 scheduled visits, 3665 (62.0%) were seen between March 18 and April 12, 2019, in comparison with 649 of 5044 (12.9%) during the corresponding COVID-19–affected period. The majority of completed visits performed in weeks 1 and 2 were in person, while the majority in weeks 3 and 4 were via telehealth. Among subspecialties, a larger proportion of completed visits in 2020 were performed by pediatric and head and neck oncology otolaryngologists as compared with general/specialty otolaryngologists (P <.001).

These public health measures can include social distancing, frequent handwashing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) at the personal level; at the community and the government level, these measures can range from canceling activities, avoiding mass gatherings, closing facilities, and, at the extreme, enacting national or provincial lockdowns. Rather than completely stopping the infectious disease, the major purpose of these NPIs in facing an emerging infectious disease is to reduce the contact rate within the population, and reduce the spread of the virus until the time a vaccine or reliable medications become available. The idea is to avoid a surge of patients with severe symptoms beyond the capacity of the hospitals’ medical resources, which would lead to more mortality and morbidity. While many countries have experienced steep curves in new cases, some, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan, seem to have controlled or even eliminated the infection locally. From its first case of COVID-19 on the 21 January until the 12 May, Taiwan had 440 cases, including just 55 local infections, and seven deaths in total, representing 1.85 cases per 100,000 population and a 1.5% death rate (based on the Worldometer 2020 statistics of Taiwan’s population of 23.8 million). This paper presents evidence that spread prevention involving mass masking and universal hygiene at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 50% decline of infectious respiratory diseases, based on historical data during the influenza season in Taiwan. These outcomes provide potential support for the effectiveness of widely implementing public health precaution measures in controlling COVID-19 without a lockdown policy. © 2020 by the authors.

The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, health care delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and health care workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment.

Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. Methods: An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials. Results: COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained. Conclusions: The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care. When alterations to the delivery of care are mandated, efforts should be taken to minimize risks and maximize safety while approximating standard practice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic metal complex; aromatase inhibitor; bleomycin; taxane derivative; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; clinical trial (topic); comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; endometrium cancer; female genital tract cancer; germ cell tumor; human; leiomyosarcoma; morbidity; ovary cancer; pandemic; priority journal; uterine cervix cancer; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; female genital tract tumor; oncology; pandemic; practice guideline; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); virology; virus pneumonia; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Medical Oncology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","32386911","Gynecol.

On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home. There were 44 cases of facial fractures with a tendency for conservative treatment. 19 cases were related to domestic violence or self-harm. Of the 216 dental related emergencies, 68% could have been managed in the primary care setting. A quarter of all emergency patients were satisfactorily managed by remote consultations.

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non–small-cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results.

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation.

This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. Results: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%–8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%–8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%–3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%–16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%–16.4%). When we compared studies from China to studies from other countries in subgroup analyses, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%–20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. Conclusions: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19. Based on findings from our meta-analysis, we provide several Best Practice Statements for the consultative management of COVID-19. © 2020","COVID-19; Gastrointestinal and Liver Manifestations","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; chloroquine; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; antivirus agent; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; acute intermittent porphyria; acute liver failure; alanine aminotransferase blood level; aminotransferase blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; China; clinical feature; clinical practice; consultation; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; drug hypersensitivity; flatulence; gastritis; gastrointestinal symptom; GRADE approach; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle conduction disturbance; hospital patient; human; hypertransaminasemia; jaundice; liver disease; liver function test; liver injury; liver toxicity; loss of appetite; management; meta analysis; nausea; outpatient; patient monitoring; porphyria cutanea tarda; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; side effect; stomach pain; systematic review; toxic hepatitis; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; gastroenterology; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal tract; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; liver; liver disease; medical society; pandemic; pathogenicity; patient referral; United States; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Liver Function Tests; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Prevalence; Referral and Consultation; Societies, Medical; United States","32407808","Gastroenterology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085027501

We report on a case of a 35-year-old renal transplant recipient who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy. With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients. © 2020 The Authors.

Five different types of falsified chloroquine tablets were discovered between March 31, 2020 and April 4, 2020, in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo by locally conducted thin layer chromatographic analysis. Subsequent investigation by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in Germany proved the absence of detectable amounts of chloroquine and the presence of undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients, that is, paracetamol and metronidazole, in four of the samples. The fifth sample contained chloroquine, but only 22% of the declared amount. Such products represent a serious risk to patients. Their occurrence exemplifies that once medicines or vaccines against COVID-19 may be developed, falsified products will enter the market immediately, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Timely preparations for the detection of such products are required, including the establishment of appropriate screening technologies in LMICs.

We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients, and excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (&lt;10 cases). Extracted data included author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching; and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates. Findings: We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2–5; range 0–15; I2=74%). The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10–21; range: 2–57; I2=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms. The pooled prevalence of abnormal liver functions (12 studies, n=1267) was 19% (9–32; range 1–53; I2=96%). Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of abdominal pain (odds ratio [OR] 7·10 [95% CI 1·93–26·07]; p=0·003; I2=0%) and abnormal liver function including increased ALT (1·89 [1·30–2·76]; p=0·0009; I2=10%) and increased AST (3·08 [2·14–4·42]; p&lt;0·00001; I2=0%) compared with those with non-severe disease. Patients in Hubei province, where the initial COVID-19 outbreak occurred, were more likely to present with abnormal liver functions (p&lt;0·0001) compared with those outside of Hubei. Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients. 10% (95% CI 4–19; range 3–23; I2=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features. Patients who presented with gastrointestinal system involvement had delayed diagnosis (standardised mean difference 2·85 [95% CI 0·22–5·48]; p=0·030; I2=73%). Patients with gastrointestinal involvement tended to have a poorer disease course (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome OR 2·96 [95% CI 1·17–7·48]; p=0·02; I2=0%). Interpretation: Our study showed that digestive symptoms and liver injury are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19. Increased attention should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients.

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a chest ultrasonographic screening program in nursing homes for detecting coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)–related pneumonia and improving the appropriateness of hospital referral of residents. Design: Pragmatic, descriptive, feasibility study from April 2 to April 9, 2020. Setting and Participants: A total of 83 older residents (age 85 ± 8) presenting mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and not previously tested for COVID-19, residing in 5 nursing homes in Northern Italy. Methods: Chest ultrasonography was performed at the bedside by a team of hospital specialists with certified expertise in thoracic ultrasonography, following a systematic approach exploring 4 different areas for each hemithorax, from the anterior and posterior side. Presence of ultrasonographic signs of interstitial pneumonia, including comet-tail artifacts (B-lines) with focal or diffuse distribution, subpleural consolidations, and pleural line indentation, was detected. The specialist team integrated ultrasonography data with clinical and anamnestic information, and gave personalized therapeutic advice for each patient, including hospital referral when needed. Results: The most frequent reasons for ultrasonographic evaluation were fever (63% of participants) and mild dyspnea (40%). Fifty-six patients (67%) had abnormal ultrasonographic findings. The most common patterns were presence of multiple subpleural consolidations (32 patients) and diffuse B-lines (24 patients), with bilateral involvement. A diagnosis of suspect COVID-19 pneumonia was made in 44 patients, and 6 of them required hospitalization. Twelve patients had ultrasonographic patterns suggesting other respiratory diseases, and 2 patients with normal ultrasonographic findings were diagnosed with COPD exacerbation. Conclusions and Implications: In nursing home residents, screening of COVID-19 pneumonia with bedside chest ultrasonography is feasible and may represent a valid diagnostic aid for an early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks and adequate patient management. © 2020 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","coronavirus; interstitial pneumonia; long-term care; Lung ultrasonography; viral pneumonia","antibiotic agent; hydroxychloroquine; steroid; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; comparative study; congestive heart failure; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; descriptive research; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; feasibility study; female; fever; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; interstitial pneumonia; Italy; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; nursing home; nursing home patient; patient referral; personalized medicine; pleura effusion; point of care ultrasound; respiratory tract disease; thorax examination; virus pneumonia; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; Doppler ultrasonography; epidemic; multicenter study; nursing home; organization and management; pandemic; point of care system; procedures; severe acute respiratory syndrome; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Nursing Homes; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Point-of-Care Systems; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Ultrasonography, Doppler","32571651","J.

Design: Retrospective single-center observational study. Setting and participants: Eighty-one patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of a general hospital in Belgium. Measurements: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical, and radiologic variables, comorbidities, symptoms, and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65-97 years) and a median CFS score of 7 (range 2-9); 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within 6 weeks, 18 patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = .03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = .011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; r = 0.301, P = .009), lymphocyte count (r = −0.262, P = .02), and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct, r = −0.285, P = .015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium, or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH, and RT-PCR Ct (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH, and viral load significantly predicted survival. Conclusions and Implications: Although their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available. © 2020 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","COVID-19; frailty; hospitalization; older adults; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","antibiotic agent; C reactive protein; hydroxychloroquine; infusion fluid; lactate dehydrogenase; aged; aged hospital patient; antibiotic therapy; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; delirium; dementia; diagnostic value; disease association; female; fluid therapy; frailty; hospital mortality; human; length of stay; long term care; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; observational study; polypharmacy; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; short term survival; very elderly; virus load; Belgium; cohort analysis; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; frail elderly; frailty; general hospital; geriatric assessment; hospitalization; incidence; mortality; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Belgium; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Hospitals, General; Humans; Incidence; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies","32674821","J.

We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems. © 2020 The Author(s)",,,,"EClinicalMedicine",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086908561

Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed to identify studies assessing CT features, clinical, and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients. A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: A total of 14 articles (including 1115 patients) based on chest CT images were retrieved. In the lesion patterns on chest CTs, we found that pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) (69%, 95% CI 58–80%), consolidation (47%, 35–60%) and “air bronchogram sign” (46%, 25–66%) were more common than the atypical lesion of “crazy-paving pattern” (15%, 8–22%). With regard to disease extent and involvement, 70% (95% CI 46–95%) of cases showed a location preference for the right lower lobe, 65% (58–73%) of patients presented with ≥3 lobes involvement, and meanwhile, 42% (32–53%) of patients had involvement of all five lobes, while 67% (55–78%) of patients showed a predominant peripheral distribution. An understanding of some important CT features might be helpful for medical surveillance and management. In terms of clinical features, muscle soreness (21%, 95% CI 15–26%) and diarrhea (7%, 4–10%) were minor symptoms compared to fever (80%, 74–87%) and cough (53%, 33–72%).

Materials and Methods: A total of 84 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed from January 23, 2020 to February 19, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: severe group (n = 23) and non-severe group (n = 61). Clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and CT findings on admission were analyzed. CT quantitative parameters, including GGO, consolidation, total lesion score, percentage GGO, and percentage consolidation (both relative to total lesion volume) were calculated. Relationships between the CT findings and laboratory data were estimated. Finally, a discrimination model was established to assess the severity of COVID-19. Results: Patients in the severe group had higher baseline neutrophil percentage, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin levels, and lower baseline lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage (p < 0.001). The severe group also had higher GGO score (p < 0.001), consolidation score (p < 0.001), total lesion score (p < 0.001), and percentage consolidation (p = 0.002), but had a lower percentage GGO (p = 0.008). These CT quantitative parameters were significantly correlated with laboratory inflammatory marker levels, including neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, hs-CRP level, and procalcitonin level (p < 0.05). The total lesion score demonstrated the best performance when the data cut-off was 8.2%. Furthermore, the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 93.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 86.8–100%), 91.3% (CI: 69.6–100%), and 91.8% (CI: 23.0–98.4%), respectively. Conclusion: CT quantitative parameters showed strong correlations with laboratory inflammatory markers, suggesting that CT quantitative analysis might be an effective and important method for assessing the severity of COVID-19, and may provide additional guidance for planning clinical treatment strategies. © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.","Computed tomography; Consolidation; Coronavirus disease 2019; Ground-glass opacity; Quantitative analysis; Severity","C reactive protein; C reactive protein; procalcitonin; aged; area under the curve; Article; child; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; consolidation; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; disease severity assessment; female; ground glass opacity; human; image segmentation; lesion volume; lung lesion; lymphadenopathy; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil percentage; pleura effusion; quantitative analysis; radiological parameters; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; adult; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; blood; China; Coronavirus infection; cytology; diagnostic imaging; hospital admission; image processing; inflammation; lung; lymphocyte; methodology; middle aged; pandemic; prognosis; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Betacoronavirus; C-Reactive Protein; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Inflammation; Lung; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Admission; Pneumonia, Viral; Procalcitonin; Prognosis; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32524786","Korean J.

Materials and Methods: All pediatric patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and who underwent CT scan in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were included in the current study. Data on clinical and CT features were collected and analyzed. Results: Four children were included in the current study. All of them were asymptomatic throughout the disease course (ranging from 7 days to 15 days), and none of them showed abnormalities in blood cell counts. Familial cluster was the main transmission pattern. Thin-section CT revealed abnormalities in three patients, and one patient did not present with any abnormal CT findings. Unilateral lung involvement was observed in two patients, and one patient showed bilateral lung involvement. In total, five small lesions were identified, including ground-glass opacity (n = 4) and consolidation (n = 1). All lesions had ill-defined margins with peripheral distribution and predilection of lower lobe.

Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to obtain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment. Methods: Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2 mg per 10 mL) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during nonpowered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling after nasal fluorescein application. Results: Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30 cm, extending to 66 cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all conditions tested. Conclusion: We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an “aerosol-generating surgery” to convey this unique risk, and this supports the need for protective personal protective equipment. © 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC","aerosol-generating surgery; aerosolization; COVID-19; endoscopy; nasal endoscopy","fluorescein; aerosol; Article; blue light; cadaver; coronavirus disease 2019; digital imaging; endoscopy; evidence based practice; human; infection risk; outpatient; priority journal; risk assessment; simulation; skull base; sneezing; surgeon; viral contamination; adverse event; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; devices; disease transmission; isolation and purification; nose disease; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; prevention and control; protective equipment; virology; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Cadaver; Coronavirus Infections; Endoscopy; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Nose Diseases; Otolaryngology; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Sneezing","32243678","Int.

In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction of vaginal swabs, amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal blood, or breast milk for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 did not show substantial results.

To determine whether infection occurred congenitally or perinatally, perinatal exposure, mode of delivery, and time interval from delivery to the diagnosis of neonatal infection were considered. Neonates with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are usually asymptomatic. In 4 cases, a diagnostic test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was performed within 48 hours of life.

A recent experimental study has suggested an increased toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in association with metformin in mice. Objective: The present study was undertaken to investigate the reality of this putative drug–drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine and metformin using pharmacovigilance data. Methods: Using VigiBase®, the WHO pharmacovigilance database, we performed a disproportionality analysis (case/non-case study). Cases were reports of fatal outcomes with the drugs of interest and non-cases were all other reports for these drugs registered between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019. Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. Results are reported as ROR (reporting odds ratio) with their 95% confidence interval. Results: Of the 10,771 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) involving hydroxychloroquine, 52 were recorded as ‘fatal outcomes’. In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9–139.3).

A total of 20 subjects were recruited and during the evaluation, each subject was invited to wear a surgical mask or respirator for 1 h. The next day in the morning at the same hour, the same subject wore a N95 mask for 1 h with the same protocol. Infrared thermal evaluation was performed to measure the facial temperature of the perioral region and the perception ratings related to the humidity, heat, breathing difficulty, and discomfort were recorded. A significant difference in heat flow and perioral region temperature was recorded between the surgical mask and the N95 respirator (p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference in humidity, heat, breathing difficulty, and discomfort was present between the groups. The study results suggest that N95 respirators are able to induce an increased facial skin temperature, greater discomfort and lower wearing adherence when compared to the medical surgical masks. © 2020 by the authors.

To give an indication of possible implications, this study investigated excess mortality patterns during a previous influenza epidemic. Methods: Using Dutch population and mortality registers, a historical cohort study was designed to compare mortality during the 2017–2018 influenza epidemic with mortality in the same period in the three previous years. People with ID were identified by entitlements to residential ID-care services as retrieved from a national database. Results: Data covered the entire adult Dutch population (12.6 million; GenPop), of which 91 064 individuals were identified with an ID. During the influenza epidemic, mortality among people with ID increased almost three times as much than in the GenPop (15.2% vs. 5.4%), and more among male individuals with ID (+19.5%) than among female individuals with ID (+10.6%), as compared with baseline. In both cohorts, comparable increases in mortality within older age groups and due to respiratory causes were seen. Particularly in the ID-cohort, excess deaths also occurred in younger age groups, due to endocrine diseases and ID-specific causes. Conclusions: During the 2017–2018 influenza epidemic, excess mortality among people with ID was three times higher than in the general Dutch population, appeared more often at young age and with a broader range of underlying causes. These findings suggest that a pandemic may disproportionally affect people with ID while population data may not immediately raise warnings. Early detection of diverging patterns and faster implementation of tailored strategies therefore require collection of good quality data. © 2020 The Authors.

The negative pressure inside the hood is generated by a fan-filter-unit (FFU) through which infectious aerosols from a patient are filtered. The outside area is kept clean which decreases the risk of nosocomial infections in hospital wards. We tried new applications of the hood. Methods: The negative pressure hood was newly applied in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a place where a staff performs the practice of suctioning that generates much aerosol from the patient, as well as a waiting space for patients. Furthermore, the possibility that the hood can be converted to a positive pressure hood as a clean hood by switching the airflow direction of FFU was assessed. The cleaning efficacy of the inside of the hood was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. Results: The hood, named Barrihood, was found to be competent to be used (I) for tracheal suctioning in ICU, (II) as a waiting space for a child in a nursery who suddenly showed symptoms of the disease and waiting to be picked-up by the guardian, and (III) as a waiting space in a special outpatient clinic in a hospital for COVID-19 suspected cases to prevent dissemination of airborne pathogens. The positive pressure hood was also competent in keeping clean air quality that meets the standard class 100 of NASA's bio-clean room category. Conclusions: The proposed new applications will broaden the range of the hood's usage. The isolation hood could be useful in many settings to protect people outside the hood from a patient inside, or to protect an individual inside from air particles outside the hood, such as airborne pathogens, allergens, or hazardous particulate matter like PM2.5. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Two independent lung protein interactome were constructed to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from the interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins in viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five hubs that interconnect both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment.

One reason is that the challenges underneath sequencing SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled, i.e., sequencing samples with low viral load often results in insufficient viral reads for analyses. Methods: We applied a novel multiplex PCR amplicon (amplicon)-based and hybrid capture (capture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 from serials dilutions of a cultured isolate, and eight clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral loads. We also examined and compared the sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. Results: We demonstrated that both amplicon and capture methods efficiently enriched SARS-CoV-2 content from clinical samples, while the enrichment efficiency of amplicon outran that of capture in more challenging samples. We found that capture was not as accurate as meta and amplicon in identifying between-sample variations, whereas amplicon method was not as accurate as the other two in investigating within-sample variations, suggesting amplicon sequencing was not suitable for studying virus-host interactions and viral transmission that heavily rely on intra-host dynamics. We illustrated that meta uncovered rich genetic information in the clinical samples besides SARS-CoV-2, providing references for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Taken all factors above and cost-effectiveness into consideration, we proposed guidance for how to choose sequencing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 under different situations. Conclusions: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work systematically investigating inter- and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 using amplicon- and capture-based whole-genome sequencing, as well as the first comparative study among multiple approaches. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Emerging infectious diseases; Genomic surveillance; Hybrid capture; iSNV; Metatranscriptomic sequencing; Multiplex PCR; Quasispecies; Virus evolution","accuracy; amplicon; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; epidemic; genetic variation; high throughput sequencing; hybrid capture based sequencing; massively parallel sequencing; metatranscriptomics; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; sensitivity analysis; sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction; virus culture; virus genome; virus load; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; pandemic; procedures; virus genome; virus pneumonia; whole genome sequencing; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Whole Genome Sequencing","32605661","Genome Med.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087406177

Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response. METHODS: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed using luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A subset of samples was tested both with and without heat inactivation. RESULTS: At >14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike protein antibodies appearing between days 8 and 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, compared with immunocompetent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the only test able to confirm this infection. However, the accuracy of RT-PCR depends on several factors; variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of detection. METHODS: In this study, we developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay that detected immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM. The assay cutoff value was determined by evaluating the sera from healthy and infected patients for pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: To evaluate assay performance, we detected IgG and IgM in the sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM was 71.4% and 57.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, combining our immunoassay with real-time RT-PCR might enhance the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2020.

This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted an age-matched case−control study in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec between Mar. 10 and Mar. 23, 2020. We included adults (age ≥ 18 yr) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cases were matched (1:1) according to 5-year age groups with control patents selected randomly from among all patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period. Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records. Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2–64.5] yr). The symptoms independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in conditional logistic regression were anosmia or dysgeusia or both (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 62.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0–359.7), presence of myalgia (adjusted OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.9–29.9), blurred vision (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0–0.8) and chest pain (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0–0.6). INTERPRETATION: We found a strong association between olfactory and gustatory symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

Given the pandemic of COVID-19, the economic impact of COVID-19 is essential to add value to the policy-making process. We retrospectively conducted a cost and affordability analysis to determine the medical costs of COVID-19 patients in China, and also assess the factors affecting their costs. Methods: This analysis was retrospectively conducted in Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital between 24 January and 16 March 2020. The total direct medical expenditures were analyzed by cost factors. We also assessed affordability by comparing the simulated out-of-pocket expenditure of COVID-19 cases relative to the per capita disposable income. Differences between groups were tested by student t test and Mann-Whitney test when appropriate. A multiple logistic regression model was built to determine the risk factors associated with high cost. Results: A total of 70 COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis. The overall mean cost was USD 6827 per treated episode. The highest mean cost was observed in drug acquisition, accounting for 45.1% of the overall cost. Total mean cost was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing diseases compared to those without pre-existing diseases. Pre-existing diseases and the advanced disease severity were strongly associated with higher cost. Around USD 0.49 billion were expected for clinical manage of COVID-19 in China. Among rural households, the proportions of health insurance coverage should be increased to 70% for severe cases, and 80% for critically ill cases to avoid catastrophic health expenditure. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that clinical management of COVID-19 patients incurs a great financial burden to national health insurance. The cost for drug acquisition is the major contributor to the medical cost, whereas the risk factors for higher cost are pre-existing diseases and severity of COVID-19. Improvement of insurance coverage will need to address the barriers of rural patients to avoid the occurrence of catastrophic health expenditure. © 2020 The Author(s).","Affordability; China; Cost; COVID-19; Treatment","adult; age; aged; Article; China; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; cost benefit analysis; disease severity; drug cost; female; finance; health care cost; human; income; major clinical study; male; priority journal; retrospective study; rural population; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; economic model; economics; health care cost; infant; middle aged; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; public health; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Expenditures; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Economic; National Health Programs; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Rural Population; Young Adult","32600426","Infect.

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047. Findings: Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 to −7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability &gt;95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD −10·6%, 95% CI −12·5 to −7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. Interpretation: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

The pathophysiology of the disease is complex and mostly unknown. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms that promote progression of the disease is critical to overcome this pandemic. To address such issues, recent studies have reported transcriptomic profiles of cells, tissues and fluids from COVID-19 patients that mainly demonstrated activation of humoral immunity, dysregulated type I and III interferon expression, intense innate immune responses and inflammatory signaling. Here, we provide novel perspectives on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 using robust functional approaches to analyze public transcriptome datasets. In addition, we compared the transcriptional signature of COVID-19 patients with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-1 and Influenza A (IAV) viruses. We identified a core transcriptional signature induced by the respiratory viruses in peripheral leukocytes, whereas the absence of significant type I interferon/antiviral responses characterized SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified the higher expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways including heme biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and tryptophan metabolism. A BTM-driven meta-analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients showed significant enrichment for neutrophils and chemokines, which were also significant in data from lung tissue of one deceased COVID-19 patient. Importantly, our results indicate higher expression of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation both in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and BALF, suggesting a critical role for mitochondrial activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, these data point for immunopathological features and targets that can be therapeutically exploited to control COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Gardinassi, Souza, Sales-Campos and Fonseca.","COVID-19; inflammation; influenza; metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; transcriptomics","fructose; galactose; glycan; heme; interferon; mannose; peptides and proteins; retinoic acid inducible protein 1 like receptor; tricarboxylic acid; unclassified drug; chemokine; interferon; transcriptome; Article; biosynthesis; carbohydrate metabolism; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; degradation; down regulation; gene expression; genetic transcription; gluconeogenesis; glycolysis; human; immune response; immunity; Influenza A virus; leukopenia; lung lavage; metabolism; nucleotide metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; pathophysiology; respiratory chain; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; T lymphocyte activation; transcriptomics; tryptophan metabolism; upregulation; Betacoronavirus; blood; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; cytology; gene expression profiling; genetics; immunology; inflammation; influenza; neutrophil; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Chemokines; Coronavirus Infections; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Inflammation; Influenza, Human; Interferon Type I; Neutrophils; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Transcriptome","32670298","Front.

The viral shedding duration was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the prognostic factors were analysed by univariate log-rank analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. A retrospective study was carried out with patients with COVID-19 in Tianjin, China. A total of 185 patients were included, 27 (14.59%) of whom were severely ill at the time of discharge and three (1.6%) of whom died. Our findings demonstrate that patients with an advanced age, diabetes, a low PaO2/FiO2 value and delayed treatment should be carefully monitored for disease progression to reduce the incidence of severe disease. Hypoproteinaemia and the fever duration warrant special attention. Timely interventions in symptomatic patients and a time from symptom onset to treatment <4 days can shorten the duration of viral shedding.","Clinical characteristics; COVID-19; duration of viral shedding; influencing factor; prognosis of disease","adult; analysis of variance; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; female; human; hypoproteinemia; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; physiology; prognosis; proportional hazards model; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; statistical model; time factor; virology; virus pneumonia; virus shedding; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Hypoproteinemia; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Time Factors; Virus Shedding","32580792","Epidemiol.

The infection has moved from China to the rest of the world and Italy represents one of the most affected countries. Older adults are more susceptible to develop complications with the consequent highest mortality rates. Case presentation: We report a case of a 95-year-old Caucasian woman affected by pneumonia, initially defined as common aspiration pneumonia in a bedridden patient with vascular dementia, which later turned out to be coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia during the initial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in our district. Some features of a computed tomography scan of her chest and her clinical history with known dysphagia had led at first to a different diagnosis with a consequent exposure of health professionals to infectious risk in two distinct hospitals. In this case report, we describe the clinical/imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and the diagnostic process that led to a correct diagnosis in a nonagenarian with multiple comorbidities. Conclusions: This case report highlights both the possible pitfalls in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in very old patients with comorbidities and the greater than expected spread of the infection, even in individuals with reduced interpersonal contacts and no defined epidemiological link. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Elderly; Older; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2","amiodarone; C reactive protein; furosemide; metoprolol; pantoprazole; piperacillin plus tazobactam; procalcitonin; warfarin; acute respiratory failure; aged; Article; aspiration pneumonia; atrial fibrillation; case report; Caucasian; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dysphagia; female; human; hypoxemia; immobility; medical history; methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; multiinfarct dementia; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; very elderly; aspiration pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; laboratory technique; pandemic; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Aspiration; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32576232","J.

Since early December 2019, COVID-19 emerged the Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The disease is still continuing spread to more than 200 countries and territories globally. AIM: This study aimed to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 among the surveillance officers and outbreak investigation team in North Sumatera, Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020, among the surveillance officers and outbreak investigation team in North Sumatera province, Indonesia. A set of validated, pre-tested questionnaire was used to measure knowledge regarding COVID-19 infection and to collect a range of explanatory variables. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. A two-step logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the association of participants’ demographic data, level of education, surveillance training, length of work, and location of workplace with the knowledge. RESULTS: A total of 246 participants were collected. We found that 109 out of 246 (44.3%) participants were good knowledge of COVID-19. Multivariate model revealed that surveillance training was the most associated variable with knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.09–4.27). In addition, as much as 27 participants (79.4%) have good knowledge and also have received surveillance training expressed a willingness to conduct surveillance (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = 1.98–11.39). CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of surveillance officers and outbreak investigation team in North Sumatera regarding COVID-19 is relatively low. Participants who have good knowledge and have received surveillance training expressed a willingness to conduct surveillance of COVID-19 in the community. Therefore, training for surveillance and outbreak investigation team to improve the understanding and skill is a must. © 2020 Frans Yosep Sitepu, Elpiani Depari,.","Indonesia; Knowledge; Surveillance; Survey",,,"Open Access Maced.

With the increasing number of recovered patients, more attention should be paid to the follow-up of these patients. Methods: In the study, 576 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital in Chongqing, China from January 24, 2020, to March 10, 2020 were evaluated by viral nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they could be released from quarantine. Among the 576 patients, 61 patients (10.6%) had positive RT-PCR test results of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyze the demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment of 61 patients. Results: These positive patients were characterized by older age, chronic medical illness and mild conditions. 38 (62.3%) patients who were asymptomatic without abnormalities on chest radiographs were found in the positive with COVID-19. Also, they showed positive results of stool or sputum specimens with negative results of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The median duration of positive result of SARS-CoV-2 was varied from 3 days to 35 days in the patients discharged from hospital with no family member infection. Conclusions: Multi-site screening of SARS-CoV-2 including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, stool and sputum specimens could be considered to improve the diagnosis, treatment and infection control in patients with COVID-19.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many patients being hospitalised with pneumonia. In China and East Asia, Chinese medicine has been widely used to treat diverse diseases for thousands of years. As an important means of treatment now, Chinese medicine plays a significant role in the treatment of respiratory diseases in China. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine for COVID-19. METHODS: We will search the following sources for the identification of trials: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP), and the Wanfang Database. All the above databases will be searched from the available date of inception until the latest issue. No language or publication restriction will be used. Randomized controlled trials will be included if they recruited participants with COVID-19 for assessing the effect of Chinese medicine vs control (placebo, no treatment, and other therapeutic agents). Primary outcomes will include chest CT and nucleic acid detection of respiratory samples. Two authors will independently scan the articles searched, extract the data from articles included, and assess the risk of bias by Cochrane tool of risk of bias. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus or the involvement of a third party. All analysis will be performed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Dichotomous variables will be reported as risk ratio or odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous variables will be summarized as mean difference or standard mean difference with 95% CIs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The available evidence of the treatment of COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine will be summarized, and evaluation of the efficacy and the adverse effects of these treatments will be made.

Most of the patients had a history of visiting Hubei Province or contacting with people who had ever stayed in or passed by Hubei Province or were exposed to symptoms. Some patients got infected through only asymptomatic contact. This study aimed to report the epidemic features and lab identification of a patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection through only asymptomatic contact. Case presentation: A 44-year-old man, who lived in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China until 6 March 2020, suffered from cough on 27 January 2020. Fever symptoms appeared on 28 January, with a maximum temperature of 38.8 °C, accompanied by cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, muscle ache, joint ache, and other symptoms. The symptoms continued until he was hospitalized on 30 January. Coronavirus conventional polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for the throat swab sample. The patient, along with his wife and son, drove from Nanchang to back to Honghu City, Hubei Province, on 23 January 2020. After staying with his parents and brother's family for 3 days, the patient drove back to Nanchang and arrived on 25 January. On the way back home, they stopped by Tongshan service area, Hubei Province, without any close contact with other people. After arriving home in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, none of them left their residence. In addition, his parents stayed at home for 20 days with his younger brother's family before they got back. His younger brother and one of his brother's children visited Wuhan on 5 January and came home on 6 January 2020. Conclusions: This report suggested that, in the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia, routine screening could miss patients who were virus carriers.

The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load were analyzed with regards NPS and OPS. Sampling discomfort reported by patients was evaluated. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate was significantly higher for NPS [46.7% (56/120)] than OPS [10.0% (12/120)] (P < 0.001). The sensitivity of NPS was also significantly higher than that of OPS (P < 0.001). At the time of sampling, the time of detectable SARS-CoV-2 had a longer median duration (25.0 vs. 20.5 days, respectively) and a longer maximum duration (41 vs. 39 days, respectively) in NPS than OPS. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of NPS (37.8, 95% CI: 37.0–38.6) was significantly lower than that of OPS (39.4, 95% CI: 38.9–39.8) by 1.6 (95% CI 1.0–2.2, P < 0.001), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 load was significantly higher in NPS specimens than OPS. Patient discomfort was low in both sampling methods. During NPS sampling, patients were significantly less likely to have nausea and vomit. Conclusions: NPS had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load than OPS. NPS could reduce droplets production during swabs. NPS should be recommended for diagnosing COVID-19 and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 load.

The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public health crisis including almost 5 million cases and 323,256 deaths as of May 21, 2020. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected FFPE cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti–SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti–SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross-detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by IHC and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established a multiplex FISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. It is hoped that these reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models. © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",,"formaldehyde; nucleocapsid protein; reagent; virus RNA; virus spike protein; formaldehyde; nucleocapsid protein; paraffin; virus antibody; virus antigen; virus RNA; Article; cell assay; cell line; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; fluorescence in situ hybridization; immunofluorescence test; immunohistochemistry; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; paraffin embedding; protein analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; staining; virus detection; virus replication; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; immunology; in situ hybridization; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; Leporidae; molecular pathology; mouse; pandemic; pathology; procedures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tissue fixation; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Formaldehyde; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization; Mice; Nucleocapsid Proteins; Pandemics; Paraffin Embedding; Pathology, Molecular; Pneumonia, Viral; Rabbits; RNA, Viral; Tissue Fixation","32379723","JCI Insight",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084616840

Case presentation: We describe a 78-year old immunocompromised woman who presented with altered mental status after witnessed seizure-like activity at home. She was found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated neuroinflammation. In this case, we undertake the first detailed analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines during COVID-19 infection and find a unique pattern of inflammation in CSF, but no evidence of viral neuroinvasion.

In 2019, a Phase IV Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)-linked malaria vaccine implementation was underway. However, in December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with many clinical, epidemiological, and biological parallels to malaria, was reported in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, and, as of the 3rd of June, 2020, more than 382,507 persons had died from COVID-19. Children under 5 years who suffer high malaria-attributable mortalities are largely asymptomatic for COVID-19. Considering that the malaria burden is highest in low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hampered. Access to healthcare has generally been limited, while malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemotherapy and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended due to lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for treatment of COVID-19 shared symptoms and the shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to COVID-19 RDTs is a cause for concern in malaria-endemic regions. Children are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the elderly. However, due to the fears of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the elderly who are worst affected by COVID-19 may not take children for malaria medication, resulting in high malaria-related mortalities among children. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected developed countries, threatening their donation capacity. These are likely to thwart malaria control efforts in low-income regions. Here, we present perspectives on the collateral impact of COVID-19 on malaria, especially in Africa. © Copyright © 2020 Nghochuzie, Olwal, Udoakang, Amenga-Etego and Amambua-Ngwa.","ACE2; coronaviruses; COVID-19; malaria; plasmodium; SARS-CoV-2","Africa; antimalarial drug resistance; Article; behavior change; China; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; disease surveillance; disease transmission; economic status; gene deletion; health care facility; human; immune response; malaria; malaria control; mixed infection; mortality rate; pandemic; pneumonia; rapid diagnostic test; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"Front.

METHODS We carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy. A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence. Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression. RESULTS Among both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile. Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex. CONCLUSIONS In this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.

Although the number of infected cases is increasing, information about its clinical characteristics in the Middle East, especially in Iran, a country which is considered to be one of the most important focal points of the disease in the world, is lacking. To date, there is no available literature on the clinical data on COVID-19 patients in Iran. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 113 hospitalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to university affiliated hospitals in Shiraz, Iran from February 20 to March 20 were entered in the study. Results: The mean age was 53.75 years and 71 (62.8%) were males. The most common symptoms at onset were fatigue (75: 66.4%), cough (73: 64.6%), and fever (67: 59.3%). Laboratory data revealed significant correlation between lymphocyte count (P value = 0.003), partial thromboplastin time (P value = 0.000), international normalized ratio (P value = 0.000) with the severity of the disease. The most common abnormality in chest CT scans was ground-glass opacity (77: 93.9%), followed by consolidation (48: 58.5%). Our results revealed an overall 8% (9 out of 113 cases) mortality rate among patients, in which the majority was among patients admitted to the ICU (5: 55.6%).

A plan is presented for how the model can be implemented worldwide in healthcare and how novel treatments and targets can be detected. The idea is based on poikilosis, pervasive heterogeneity, and variation at all levels, systems, and mechanisms. Poikilosis in diseases can be taken into account in pathogenicity model, which is based on distribution of three independent condition measures—extent, modulation, and severity. Pathogenicity model is a population or cohort-based description of disease components. Evidence-based thresholds can be applied to the pathogenicity model and used for diagnosis as well as for early detection of patients in risk of developing the most severe forms of the disease. Analysis of patients with differential course of disease can help in detecting biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic significance. A practical and feasible plan is presented how the concepts can be implemented in practice.

Methods: Primers showing optimal in-silico features were subjected to analytical sensitivity and specificity to assess the limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reaction with closely- and distantly-related viral species, and clinically prominent bacterial and fungal species. In order to evaluate the clinical utility, our RT-LAMP was subjected to a large number of clinical samples, including 213 negative and 47 positive patients, relative to two commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays. Results: The analytical specificity and sensitivity of our assay was 100% and 500 copies/ml when serial dilution was performed in both water and sputum. Subjecting our RT-LAMP assay to clinical samples showed a high degree of specificity (99.5%), sensitivity (91.4%), positive predictive value (97.7%), and negative predictive value (98.1%) when used relative to qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay was two times faster than qRT-PCR and is storable at room temperature. A suspected case that later became positive tested positive using both our RT-LAMP and the two qRT-PCR assays, which shows the capability of our assay for screening purposes. Conclusions: We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process two times more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes when demand is increasing at critical situations. © Copyright © 2020 Jiang, Pan, Arasthfer, Fang, Ling, Fang, Daneshnia, Yu, Liao, Pei, Li and Lass-Flörl.","COVID-19; diagnostic test; qRT-PCR; RT-LAMP; SARS-CoV-2","betaine; epinephrine; nucleocapsid protein; STAT3 protein; agglutination test; Article; China; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; DNA extraction; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; high throughput screening; human; Human parainfluenza virus 3; Human respiratory syncytial virus; influenza A (H5N1); Influenza A virus (H9N2); limit of detection; loop mediated isothermal amplification; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; medical care; nonhuman; predictive value; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; temperature; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; mass screening; nucleic acid amplification; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mass Screening; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity","32626666","Front.

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain. Methods: We did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 1·5 × 1011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127. Findings: Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36·3 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. Interpretation: The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.

People infected with this highly contagious virus can present with clinically inapparent, mild, or severe disease. Currently, the virus infection in individuals and at the population level is being monitored by PCR testing of symptomatic patients for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV-specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD's performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) for antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a strong correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, support using the RBD antigen in serological diagnostic assays and RBD-specific antibody levels as a correlate of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in people.

However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. Confirmed cases were defined by positive RT-PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in throat-swab specimens. Chest CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. Results: A total of 102 patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of March 25, 85 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 2 remained hospitalized. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (median age, 69 [interquartile range, 58-77] vs. 55 [44-66], p = 0.003), and more likely to have decreased lymphocyte count (0.5 vs. 0.9 × 109/L, p = 0.006), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (569.0 vs. 272.0 U/L, p < 0.001), elevated d-dimer (> 1 μg/mL, 86% vs. 37%, p = 0.002) on admission. Older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality in a multivariate regression model included the above variables. In a subset of patients with CT images within the first week, higher total severity score, and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporating the above mentioned variables. Conclusions: Older age, elevated LDH on admission, and higher severity score of CT images within the first week are potential predictors of fatality in adults with COVID-19. These predictors may help clinicians identify patients with a poor prognosis at an early stage. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Fatality; Predictor; Radiographic findings","D dimer; lactate dehydrogenase; adult; aged; aging; Article; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; fatality; female; hospitalization; human; lung lobe; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; mortality; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survival; thorax radiography","32527255","Respir.

Despite ongoing research toward the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, such a vaccine will not be available in time to contribute to the containment of the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a framework for the rapid identification of novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We analyzed publicly available transcriptomic datasets of SARS-CoV infected humans and mammals to identify consistent differentially expressed genes then validated in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells transcriptomic datasets. Comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of the identified genes to identify possible interactions with clinically proven drugs was carried out. We identified IFITM3 as an early upregulated gene, and valproic acid was found to enhance its mRNA expression as well as induce its antiviral action. These findings indicate that analysis of publicly available transcriptomic and toxicogenomic data represents a rapid approach for the identification of novel targets and molecules that can modify the action of such targets during the early phases of emerging infections like COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Hachim, Al Heialy, Hachim, Halwani, Senok, Maghazachi and Hamid.","antiviral immunity; COVID-19; interferon-induced transmembrane proteins; SARS-CoV-2; valproic acid","2', 5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase; carbon nanotube; cell nucleus antigen; CXCL11 chemokine; dynamin; ethinylestradiol; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interferon; interferon induced helicase C domain containing protein 1; interferon induced protein 35; interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1; interferon induced transmembrane protein 3; interferon regulatory factor 7; interleukin 6; membrane protein; MX dynamin like GTPase 1; MX dynamin like GTPase 2; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; paracetamol; pirinixic acid; retinoic acid inducible protein I; SP100 nuclear antigen; STAT1 protein; tripartite motif protein; ubiquitin specific peptidase 18; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; valproic acid; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis; XIAP associated factor 1; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase; antivirus agent; IFITM3 protein, human; membrane protein; Myxovirus resistance protein; RNA binding protein; valproic acid; antiviral activity; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; DNA microarray; gene expression; gene ontology; human; immune response; lung epithelium; Macaca fascicularis; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; toxicogenomics; transcriptomics; upregulation; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease model; drug effect; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; innate immunity; lung; mouse; Mustela putorius furo; pandemic; physiology; species difference; upregulation; virus pneumonia; 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Ferrets; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Lung; Macaca fascicularis; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Myxovirus Resistance Proteins; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA-Binding Proteins; Species Specificity; Up-Regulation; Valproic Acid","32595654","Front.

Design Cross sectional study. Setting Four hospitals in Wuhan, China. Participants 420 healthcare professionals (116 doctors and 304 nurses) who were deployed to Wuhan by two affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-sen University and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University for 6-8 weeks from 24 January to 7 April 2020. These study participants were provided with appropriate personal protective equipment to deliver healthcare to patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and were involved in aerosol generating procedures. 77 healthcare professionals with no exposure history to covid-19 and 80 patients who had recovered from covid-19 were recruited to verify the accuracy of antibody testing. Main outcome measures Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, cough, and dyspnoea) and evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined as a positive test for virus specific nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs, or a positive test for IgM or IgG antibodies in the serum samples. Results The average age of study participants was 35.8 years and 68.1% (286/420) were women. These study participants worked 4-6 hour shifts for an average of 5.4 days a week; they worked an average of 16.2 hours each week in intensive care units. All 420 study participants had direct contact with patients with covid-19 and performed at least one aerosol generating procedure. During the deployment period in Wuhan, none of the study participants reported covid-19 related symptoms. When the participants returned home, they all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleic acids and IgM or IgG antibodies (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.7%). Conclusion Before a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, healthcare professionals remain susceptible to covid-19. Despite being at high risk of exposure, study participants were appropriately protected and did not contract infection or develop protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare systems must give priority to the procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment, and provide adequate training to healthcare professionals in its use. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

To alleviate this problem, telemedicine is increasingly being viewed as an effective means through which patients can be diagnosed and medications prescribed by doctors via untact Thus, concomitant with developments in information and communication technology (ICT), medical institutions have actively analyzed and applied ICT to medical systems to provide optimal medical services. However, with the convergence of these diverse technologies, various risks and security threats have emerged. To protect patients and improve telemedicine quality for patient safety, it is necessary to analyze these risks and security threats comprehensively and institute appropriate countermeasures. Methods: The security threats likely to be encountered in each of seven telemedicine service areas were analyzed, and related data were collected directly through on-site surveys by a medical institution. Subsequently, an attack tree, the most popular reliability and risk modeling approach for systematically characterizing the potential risks of telemedicine systems, was examined and utilized with the attack occurrence probability and attack success probability as variables to provide a comprehensive risk assessment method. Results: In this study, the most popular modelling method, an attack tree, was applied to the telemedicine environment, and the security concerns for telemedicine systems were found to be very large. Risk management and evaluation methods suitable for the telemedicine environment were identified, and their benefits and potential limitations were assessed. Conclusion: This research should be beneficial to security experts who wish to investigate the impacts of cybersecurity threats on remote healthcare and researchers who wish to identify new modeling opportunities to apply security risk modeling techniques. © 2020 The Author(s).","Medical information security; Smart medical security; Telecare security; Telemedicine security","Betacoronavirus; computer security; confidentiality; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; human; nonbiological model; organization and management; pandemic; patient safety; reproducibility; risk management; telemedicine; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Models, Organizational; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Management; Telemedicine","32522216","BMC Med.

We aimed to establish a relationship between the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for early detection and assessment to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-Cov-2. Methods: We collected published data on the clinical features of Covid-19 retrospectively and categorized them into physical and blood biomarkers. Common features were assigned scores by the Borg scoring method with slight modifications and were incorporated into a newly-developed Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 assessment Chart. Correlations between signs and symptoms with the development of Covid-19 was assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho). Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the highest correlating features. The frequency of signs and symptoms in developing Covid-19 was assessed through Chi-square test two tailed with Cramer's V strength. Changes in signs and symptoms were incorporated into a chart that consisted of four tiers representing disease stages. Results: Data from 10,172 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases showed a correlation with Fever in 43.9% (P = 0.000) cases, cough 54.08% and dry mucus 25.68% equally significant (P = 0.000), Hyperemic pharyngeal mucus membrane 17.92% (P = 0.005), leukopenia 28.11% (P = 0.000), lymphopenia 64.35% (P = 0.000), thrombopenia 35.49% (P = 0.000), elevated Alanine aminotransferase 50.02% (P = 0.000), and Aspartate aminotransferase 34.49% (P = 0.000). The chart exhibited a maximum scoring of 39. Normal tier scoring was ≤ 12/39, mild state scoring was 13–22/39, and star values scoring was ≥7/15; this latter category on the chart means Covid-19 is progressing and quarantine should be adopted. Moderate stage scored 23–33 and severe scored 34–39 in the chart.

Several issues concerning the origin, time of introduction to humans, evolutionary patterns, and underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remain unclear. Method: Genetic variation in 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and related coronaviruses as of 2/23/2020 was analyzed. Result: After correcting for mutational bias, the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites was revealed which is consistent with the recent outbreak of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV during its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation. The sequence similarity in the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression that occurred approximately 40 years ago. The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have originated on 12/11/2019 (95% HPD 11/13/2019-12/23/2019). The effective population size of the virus showed an approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of Wuhan (1/23/2020) and ceased to increase afterwards, demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing its spread. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251 V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The former first appeared on 1/5/2020 and plateaued around 1/23/2020. The latter rapidly increased in frequency after 1/23/2020. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China is two times higher than those derived from the rest of the world. A network analysis found that haplotypes collected from Wuhan were interior and had more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originated in China. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being discovered. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and determine the critical steps required for effective spreading. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Mutational bias; Population genetics; Positive selection","orf3 protein; orf8 protein; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus spike protein; Article; China; Coronavirinae; evolutionary adaptation; gene mutation; genetic variability; genetic variation; haplotype; human; introgression; isolation; nonhuman; pandemic; Pholidota (animal); population size; priority journal; quarantine; receptor binding; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus genome; virus infectivity; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; genetics; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32507105","J.

The aim of our work was to better quantify misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves using publicly available surveillance data from Alberta, Canada and Philadelphia, USA. Methods: We examined time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. Results: Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity, but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity. We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the adjusted epidemic curves likely falls within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among the tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. Conclusion: The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves. © 2020 The Author(s).","Bias analysis; Epidemic; Sensitivity; Simulation; Specificity; Uncertainty; Under-diagnosis","Alberta; Bayes theorem; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; human; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; Pennsylvania; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistical bias; uncertainty; virology; virus pneumonia; Alberta; Bayes Theorem; Betacoronavirus; Bias; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Philadelphia; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Uncertainty","32505172","BMC Med.

COVID-19 was later confirmed in both patients by serum antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 and nucleic acid test on stool samples. Because children are susceptible to many respiratory pathogens, especially influenza, we concluded that children can be coinfected with multiple pathogens, and more attention should be paid to the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic of COVID-19.

The full-blown COVID-19 can lead, in susceptible individuals, to premature death because of the massive viral proliferation, hypoxia, misdirected host immunoresponse, microthrombosis, and drug toxicities. Alike other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a neuroinvasive potential, which may be associated with early neurological symptoms. In the past, the nervous tissue of patients infected with other coronaviruses was shown to be heavily infiltrated. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 commonly report dysosmia, which has been related to the viral access in the olfactory bulb. However, this early symptom may reflect the nasal proliferation that should not be confused with the viral access in the central nervous system of the host, which can instead be allowed by means of other routes for spreading in most of the neuroanatomical districts. Axonal, trans-synaptic, perineural, blood, lymphatic, or Trojan routes can gain the virus multiples accesses from peripheral neuronal networks, thus ultimately invading the brain and brainstem. The death upon respiratory failure may be also associated with the local inflammation- and thrombi-derived damages to the respiratory reflexes in both the lung neuronal network and brainstem center. Beyond the infection-associated neurological symptoms, long-term neuropsychiatric consequences that could occur months after the host recovery are not to be excluded. While our article does not attempt to fully comprehend all accesses for host neuroinvasion, we aim at stimulating researchers and clinicians to fully consider the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which is likely to affect the peripheral nervous system targets first, such as the enteric and pulmonary nervous networks. This acknowledgment may shed some light on the disease understanding further guiding public health preventive efforts and medical therapies to fight the pandemic that directly or indirectly affects healthy isolated individuals, quarantined subjects, sick hospitalized, and healthcare workers. © Copyright © 2020 Briguglio, Bona, Porta, Dell'Osso, Pregliasco and Banfi.","coronavirus; COVID-19; host pathogen interactions; infections; olfactory bulb; SARS-CoV-2; smell; virulence","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Article; brain stem; breathing reflex; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; dysosmia; host pathogen interaction; human; intestine innervation; nerve cell network; nerve fiber; nerve injury; neuroanatomy; neurophysiology; neuropsychiatry; nonhuman; nose cavity; olfactory bulb; olfactory receptor; peripheral nerve; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sniffing; symptom",,"Front.

A common denominator of all affected organs is the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protease responsible for the conversion of Angiotensin 1-8 (Ang II) to Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7). Ang 1-7 acts on these tissues and in other target organs via Mas receptor (MasR), where it exerts beneficial effects, including vasodilation and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis, along an attenuation of cardiac and vascular remodeling. Unfortunately, ACE2 also serves as the binding receptor of SARS viral spike glycoprotein, enabling its attachment to host cells, with subsequent viral internalization and replication. Although numerous reports have linked the devastating organ injuries to viral homing and attachment to organ-specific cells widely expressing ACE2, little attention has been given to ACE-2 expressed by the immune system. Herein we outline potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on macrophages and dendritic cells, key cells of the immune system expressing ACE2. Specifically, we propose a new hypothesis that, while macrophages play an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, in the case of SARS-CoV, they may also serve as a Trojan horse, enabling viral anchoring specifically within the pulmonary parenchyma. It is tempting to assume that diverse expression of ACE2 in macrophages among individuals might govern the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, reallocation of viral-containing macrophages migrating out of the lung to other tissues is theoretically plausible in the context of viral spread with the involvement of other organs. © Copyright © 2020 Abassi, Knaney, Karram and Heyman.","ACE2; acute respiratory distress syndrome; defense; lung; macrophages; reservoir; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin[1-7]; interleukin 8; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus receptor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell migration; chronic obstructive lung disease; congestive heart failure; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; dendritic cell; human; inflammation; lung alveolus macrophage; lung lavage; lung parenchyma; lymphocytopenia; mortality rate; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phenotype; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vascular remodeling; virus attachment; virus entry; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; lung; lung alveolus macrophage; metabolism; pandemic; parenchyma; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dendritic Cells; Humans; Lung; Macrophages, Alveolar; Pandemics; Parenchymal Tissue; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","32582222","Front.

Since then, several countries went into lockdown. Using a mechanistic-statistical formalism, we estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number Re of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (Re = 0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45–0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0–4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of Re is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities. © Copyright © 2020 Roques, Klein, Papaïx, Sar and Soubeyrand.","Bayesian inference; COVID-19; effective reproduction number; herd immunity; lockdown; mechanistic-statistical model; SARS-CoV-2; SIR model","Article; basic reproduction number; coronavirus disease 2019; France; herd immunity; human; isolation; nursing home; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus shedding",,"Front.

Early detection of severe patients with COVID-19 is of great significance to shorten the disease course and reduce mortality. Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of 80 patients (including 56 mild and 24 severe) with COVID-19 infection treated at Beijing You'an Hospital. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to select the risk factors of severe and even fetal pneumonia and build scoring system for prediction, which was validated later on in a group of 22 COVID-19 patients. Results: Age, white blood cell count, neutrophil, glomerular filtration rate, and myoglobin were selected by multivariate analysis as candidates of scoring system for prediction of disease severity in COVID-19. The scoring system was applied to calculate the predictive value and found that the percentage of ICU admission (20%, 6/30) and ventilation (16.7%, 5/30) in patients with high risk was much higher than those (2%, 1/50; 2%, 1/50) in patients with low risk (p = 0.009; p = 0.026). The AUC of scoring system was 0.906, sensitivity of prediction is 70.8%, and the specificity is 89.3%. According to scoring system, the probability of patients in high risk group developing severe disease was 20.24 times than that in low risk group. Conclusions: The possibility of severity in COVID-19 infection predicted by scoring system could help patients to receiving different therapy strategies at a very early stage.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: General paediatric department of a university hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: 21 children and adolescents (aged ≤18 years) with features of Kawasaki disease who were admitted to hospital between 27 April and 11 May 2020 and followed up until discharge by 15 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were clinical and biological data, imaging and echocardiographic findings, treatment, and outcomes. Nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies to the virus. RESULTS: 21 children and adolescents (median age 7.9 (range 3.7-16.6) years) were admitted with features of Kawasaki disease over a 15 day period, with 12 (57%) of African ancestry. 12 (57%) presented with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome and 16 (76%) with myocarditis. 17 (81%) required intensive care support. All 21 patients had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms during the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. 19 (90%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR result in 8/21, positive IgG antibody detection in 19/21). All 21 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 10 (48%) also received corticosteroids. The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 (24%) of the patients during hospital stay. By 15 May 2020, after 8 (5-17) days of hospital stay, all patients were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing outbreak of Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children and adolescents in the Paris area might be related to SARS-CoV-2. In this study an unusually high proportion of the affected children and adolescents had gastrointestinal symptoms, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and were of African ancestry. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19–69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab. (4) Conclusions: Our experience in Central Italy demonstrated a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HWs, but higher than in the general population. Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. High awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mandatory for all people, but especially for HWs, irrespective of symptoms, to safeguard their health and that of patients. © 2020 by the authors.

After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices. Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behavior. In particular, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behavior. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e., how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of an outbreak. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. Methods: We collected 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from Naver, the most popular Korean web portal (January 20, 2020, to March 2, 2020). Three main methods were used in this study: (1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions; (2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions; and (3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. Results: A total of 50 topics and 6 cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. Although relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. Conclusions: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the sarbecovirus (lineage-B) sub-genus within the betacoronavirus genus of the coronaviridae family. SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with SARS-CoV, which was responsible for the 2003 SARS epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 binds with great affinity to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors on human cells, and its ~30 kilobases long RNA genome hijacks the host machinery and compromises the host immune system with the help of accessory proteins, such as non-structural proteins, resulting in a widespread infection. The spike protein is responsible for the contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and, together with the nucleocapsid protein, elicits the host inflammatory response. Several real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests have been developed to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, rapid tests based on SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens and antibodies have been developed to conduct epidemiological surveillance of the hotspot regions that are worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until effective measures to prevent the occurrence or spread of COVID-19 pandemic are developed, containment measures are being taken, such as isolation of confirmed COVID-19 patients, quarantine of individuals who may have come in contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual, community-wide social distancing, state/nation-wide lockdown, etc. Several vaccines and drugs are being tested that could target the viral structural proteins, non-structural proteins or associated SARS-CoV-2 sub-genomic RNA regions. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","coronavirus; COVID-19; diagnosis; genetics; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has become the cause of the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was discovered. Until 18 February 2020, there were 72 533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10 644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading among the public and causing substantial burden due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic.

To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce. We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received U.S. FDA EUA on 12 March 2020.

Immediate prospective head-to-head comparative evaluation followed on 502 samples, and the diagnostic approaches showed overall agreement of 99.6% and a kappa value of 0.98. A good correlation (r2 _ 0.96) between cycle threshold values for SARS-CoV-2-specific targets obtained by cobas and the comparator was observed. Our results showed that cobas is a reliable assay for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in the Universal Transport Medium System (UTM-RT) (Copan, Brescia, Italy).

Methods: We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay, and evaluated it for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. Results: The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (±SD) times were 18 ± 1.32 min and 20 ± 1.80 min, respectively, and 63°C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivities were 2 × 101 copies and 2 × 102 copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with 60 other respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 92.3%–100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7%–100%). This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in a mean (±SD) time of 26.28 ± 4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples.

Methods: Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses. Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. Results: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 %), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay. Using the in-house assays as the ""gold standard"", the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 %, 92.16 %, 55.56 % and 100 % respectively. The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, p = 0.0031). Conclusions: The AusDiagnostics assay is not specific for the detection SARS-CoV-2. Any positive results should be confirmed using another NAT or sequencing. The case definition used to investigate persons with suspected COVID-19 infection is not specific. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; NAT; SARS-CoV-2","adult; aged; Article; child; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; Enterovirus; false positive result; female; human; Human adenovirus C; Human metapneumovirus; Human respiratory syncytial virus; infant; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; male; middle aged; multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction; nasopharyngeal aspiration; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; Paramyxovirinae; predictive value; preschool child; priority journal; Rhinovirus; school child; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum; throat culture; very elderly; virus detection; virus load; young adult; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; molecular diagnosis; nasopharynx; newborn; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","32361322","J.

GICA and ELISA were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 86 serum samples, including 5 influenza A virus (Flu A) IgM-positive sera, 5 influenza B virus (Flu B) IgM-positive sera, 5 Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM-positive sera, 5 Legionella pneumophila IgM-positive sera, 6 sera of HIV infection patients, 36 rheumatoid factor IgM (RF-IgM)-positive sera, 5 sera from hypertensive patients, 5 sera from diabetes mellitus patients, and 14 sera from novel coronavirus infection disease 19 (COVID-19) patients. The interference factors causing false-positive reactivity with the two methods were analyzed, and the urea dissociation test was employed to dissociate the SARS-CoV-2 IgMpositive serum using the best dissociation concentration. The two methods detected positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM in 22 mid-to-high-level-RF-IgM-positive sera and 14 sera from COVID-19 patients; the other 50 sera were negative. At a urea dissociation concentration of 6 mol/liter, SARS-CoV-2 IgM results were positive in 1 mid-to-high-level- RF-IgM-positive serum and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using GICA. At a urea dissociation concentration of 4 mol/liter and with affinity index (AI) levels lower than 0.371 set to negative, SARS-CoV-2 IgM results were positive in 3 mid-to-highlevel- RF-IgM-positive sera and in 14 COVID-19 patient sera detected using ELISA. The presence of RF-IgM at mid-to-high levels could lead to false-positive reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM detected using GICA and ELISA, and urea dissociation tests would be helpful in reducing SARS-CoV-2 IgM false-positive results. © 2020 Wang et al.","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; False-positive; Gold immunochromatography assay; Novel coronavirus; Urea","bacterium antibody; immunoglobulin M; rheumatoid factor; urea; virus antibody; immunoglobulin M; affinity index; antibody detection; Article; chemical parameters; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetic patient; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; false positive result; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; hypertensive patient; immunoaffinity chromatography; Influenza A virus; Influenza B virus; intermethod comparison; laboratory test; Legionella pneumophila; major clinical study; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; nonhuman; patient; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; urea dissociation test; affinity chromatography; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; false positive result; immunology; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Chromatography, Affinity; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Immunoglobulin M; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32277023","J.

In this study, two mono-target assays recommended by WHO (E-Sarbeco (enveloppe gene, Charite University, Berlin, Germany) and RdRp-IP4 (RdRp, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France)) were selected and combined in a unique robust test; the resulting duo SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay was compared to the two parental monoplex tests. The duo SARS-CoV-2 assay performed equally, or better, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, linearity and signal intensity. We demonstrated that combining two single systems into a dual-target assay (with or without an MS2-based internal control) did not impair performances, providing a potent tool adapted for routine molecular diagnosis in clinical microbiology laboratories. © 2020 by the authors.","coronavirus; COVID-19; diagnosis; diagnostics; emerging; molecular; outbreak; preparedness; real-time PCR; respiratory; response; TaqMan","envelope protein, SARS-CoV-2; RNA directed RNA polymerase; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, coronavirus; viral protein; virus envelope protein; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; virology; virus pneumonia; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Replicase; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Viral Envelope Proteins; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; World Health Organization","32630601","Viruses",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087727279

Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay targeting two regions of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) to a high complexity molecular-based, laboratory-developed EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene. Study design: We performed a diagnostic comparison study by testing nasopharyngeal samples on the two assays. Assay agreement was assessed by overall percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: A total of 184 nasopharyngeal samples were tested using the two assays, of which 180 showed valid results and were included for the comparative analysis. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 98.3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 95.2–99.7) and kappa coefficient was 0.97 (95 % CI 0.93–1.0). One sample was detected on the SHC laboratory developed test (LDT) and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9. Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6. Conclusion: The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Other considerations, including reagent availability, turnaround time, labor requirements, cost and instrument throughput should guide the decision of which assay to perform. © 2020","Laboratory-developed test; Panther fusion; QIAsymphony; SARS-CoV-2","article; controlled study; envelope gene; kappa statistics; major clinical study; nonhuman; open reading frame; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; task performance; turnaround time; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic kit; genetics; human; isolation and purification; molecular diagnosis; nasopharynx; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; virology; virus pneumonia; envelope protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus envelope protein; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Reproducibility of Results; Viral Envelope Proteins","32353760","J.

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results: The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics. Conclusions: Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Nucleic acid test; Positive rate; SARS-CoV-2","adult; age; aged; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; female; hospital; human; infection risk; major clinical study; male; nose smear; nucleic acid analysis; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; throat culture; viral nucleic acid test; virus detection; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; genetics; laboratory technique; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory system; risk factor; sex factor; sputum; virology; virus nucleocapsid; virus pneumonia; young adult; virus DNA; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; DNA, Viral; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nucleocapsid; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory System; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sputum; Young Adult","32156607","Clin.

Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of GI symptoms, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and fecal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 among patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020. Search terms included ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-Cov-2,"" and/or ""novel coronavirus."" Study Selection: Eligible studies were those including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported GI symptoms. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on patients with GI symptoms (ie, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), liver enzyme level changes, and fecal shedding of virus were extracted. Quality of studies was examined using methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled estimates (%) were reported with 95% CIs with level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Study and patient characteristics with pooled detection rates for diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, liver enzyme levels outside reference ranges, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in feces tests were analyzed. Results: Of 1484 records reviewed, 23 published and 6 preprint studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 4805 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.2 [14.8] years; 1598 [33.2%] women) with COVID-19. The pooled rates were 7.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-12.2%) of patients reporting diarrhea and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) of patients reporting nausea or vomiting. The pooled rate for aspartate aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 20% (95% CI, 15.3%-25.6%) of patients, and the pooled rate for alanine aminotransferase levels outside reference ranges was 14.6% (95% CI, 12.8%-16.6%) of patients. Fecal tests that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported in 8 studies, and viral RNA shedding was detected in feces in 40.5% (95% CI, 27.4%-55.1%) of patients. There was high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 94%), but no statistically significant publication bias noted. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that that 12% of patients with COVID-19 will manifest GI symptoms; however, SAR-CoV-2 shedding was observed in 40.5% of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the need to better understand what measures are needed to prevent further spread of this highly contagious pathogen.",,"adult; Betacoronavirus; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; feces; female; gastrointestinal disease; human; male; meta analysis; middle aged; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus pneumonia; virus shedding; young adult; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Virus Shedding; Young Adult","32525549","JAMA Netw Open",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086354124

Study design: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories. Results: We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020 to 10.03.2020. One minipool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. Results: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2 % were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10–23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17–24; N = 216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30 % of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. Conclusions: This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Dynamic profile; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","nucleocapsid protein; virus RNA; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; child; China; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; descriptive research; disease duration; false negative result; false positive result; female; hospital patient; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; nose smear; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; risk factor; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; staging; throat culture; virus detection; virus infectivity; virus load; virus replication; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; hospitalization; laboratory technique; middle aged; nose; pandemic; pharynx; qualitative research; respiratory system; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sex factor; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; False Negative Reactions; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nose; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Qualitative Research; Respiratory System; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sex Factors; Young Adult","32361324","J.

The pandemic has instigated widespread research related to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease that it causes, COVID-19. Research into this new virus will be facilitated by the availability of clearly described and effective procedures that enable the propagation and quantification of infectious virus. As work with the virus is recommended to be performed at biosafety level 3, validated methods to effectively inactivate the virus to enable the safe study of RNA, DNA, and protein from infected cells are also needed.

Although several diagnostic methods have been developed in this regard, their accuracy for clinical application is not very clear yet. To compare the diagnostic value of laboratory tests for the detection of COVID-19 infection, this study provides an upcoming review of the newly developed detection methods. Sensitivity, specificity, detection limit, and turn-around-time of these methods are compared and challenges for their application in clinical settings are reviewed. PubMed and Google Scholar web sites were used for the systematic search until April 9, 2020 to identify the published studies based on the following keywords: “Detection”, “Coro-navirus 2019”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “Sensitivity”. Out of 526 results, a total of 54 articles, including 46 studies on detection methods, were considered eligible for the review. The results showed that most of the proposed tests focused on molecular methods, while immunological and point-of-care tests were investigated in 13 studies. There were also a few commercial automated methods for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, most of which are not examined in the current review, as no data about their sensitivity and specificity were presented. Although the assessment of publication biases showed that 64% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity for RT-PCR are close to reality, most of the related reports for serological methods are not valid and further studies are needed to confirm their utility in clinical settings. Moreover, the RT-PCR test alone cannot act as a gold standard because of bias in measurements. Therefore, antibody tests and other proposed methods could be used as supplementary diagnostic tests to improve RT-PCR accuracy. Although clinical findings are invaluable, in many cases, they can provide more valuable supportive data than serological tests. © 2020, Author(s).","COVID-19; Diagnosis; Diagnostics; Novel Coronavirus; Real-time PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; diagnostic value; follow up; gold standard; human; immunoassay; immunohistochemistry; laboratory test; limit of detection; Medline; molecular diagnosis; point of care testing; proteomics; publication bias; qualitative diagnosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review",,"Arch.

At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified, and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as six RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification, and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 min. This minimizes hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result, and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening, and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting. © 2020 by the authors.

A new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was soon found to be the cause. At present, the sensitivity of clinical nucleic acid detection is limited, and it is still unclear whether it is related to genetic variation. In this study, we retrieved 95 full-length genomic sequences of SARAS-CoV-2 strains from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID databases, established the reference sequence by conducting multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses, and analyzed sequence variations along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The homology among all viral strains was generally high, among them, 99.99% (99.91%-100%) at the nucleotide level and 99.99% (99.79%-100%) at the amino acid level. Although overall variation in open-reading frame (ORF) regions is low, 13 variation sites in 1a, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8, and N regions were identified, among which positions nt28144 in ORF 8 and nt8782 in ORF 1a showed mutation rate of 30.53% (29/95) and 29.47% (28/95), respectively. These findings suggested that there may be selective mutations in SARS-COV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes.

However, given the temporary closure of UK stop smoking services and vape shops, smokers attempting to quit may instead seek out mobile health support, such as smartphone apps. Objective: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free. Methods: Data were from daily and nondaily adult smokers in the United Kingdom who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020 (secondary analysis). The outcome variable was the number of downloads aggregated at the 12-hourly (primary analysis) or daily level (secondary analysis). The explanatory variable was the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, operationalized as March 1, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 15, 2020 (secondary analysis). Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted. Results: Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users. In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Calculation of Bayes factors (BFs) indicated that the data for the primary analysis favored the null hypothesis compared with large associations (for level, BF=0.25; for slope, BF=0.26) but were insensitive to the detection of small associations (for level, BF=0.78; for slope, BF=1.35). Conclusions: In the United Kingdom, between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, there was no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a large step change or increasing trend in downloads of a popular smoking cessation app. Findings on the association of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a small step change or increasing trend were inconclusive. © Olga Perski, Aleksandra Herbeć, Lion Shahab, Jamie Brown.","App; COVID-19; Mobile health; Public health; SARS-cov-2; Smartphone app; Smoking; Smoking cessation; Time series analysis","adult; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; mobile application; motivation; pandemic; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoking; smoking cessation; United Kingdom; virus pneumonia; Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Mobile Applications; Motivation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Smokers; Smoking Cessation; United Kingdom","32463375","JMIR mHealth uHealth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086419216

Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) has highlighted the need for better control of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, developing novel virus-specific vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 can be time-consuming and costly. Convalescent sera and safe-in-man broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAAs) are readily available treatment options. Here, we developed a neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 strain and Vero-E6 cells. We identified the most potent sera from recovered patients for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56°C has been recommended to inactivate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. METHODS: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2, particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times, and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT. RESULTS: Our study showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. CONCLUSION: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration. © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals. We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation. © 2020 by the authors.","Infection dynamics; Ozone; PM2.5; SARS-CoV-2; Viral outbreak","ammonia; ozone; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; artificial neural network; atmosphere; atmospheric pressure; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; environmental factor; epidemic; geographic distribution; hospitalization; human; Italy; morbidity; particle size; particulate matter; population density; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; spatiotemporal analysis; adverse event; atmosphere; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; pandemic; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Atmosphere; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Italy; Models, Theoretical; Ozone; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral","32471302","Viruses",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085688092

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. Methods: Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. Results: Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season. Since all patients shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, expanded surveillance of detailed exposure history for suspected patients and application of rapid detection tools are highly recommended. © 2020","COVID-19; FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel; SARS-CO-V-2","adult; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; comorbidity; comparative study; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease course; disease surveillance; dyspnea; female; fever; flu like syndrome; human; influenza A; male; myalgia; Mycoplasma pneumonia; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; rhinorrhea; screening; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; sputum; Taiwan; travel; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; mass screening; pandemic; procedures; season; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Taiwan; Travel","32220574","J.

We argue for inhibition of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. We believe that TRPV4 inhibition has a powerful prospect at protecting this vital barrier in COVID-19 patients, even to rescue a damaged barrier. A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema. We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in COVID-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema. Perplexingly, among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, none is designed to directly protect the alveolo-capillary barrier. Successful protection of the alveolo-capillary barrier will not only reduce CO-VID-19 lethality but will also preempt a distressing healthcare scenario with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration. © 2020 the American Physiological Society","COVID-19; Pulmonary edema; SARS-CoV-2; TRPV4; TRPV4 inhibitor","calcium; TRPV4 protein, human; vanilloid receptor; artificial ventilation; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; human; lung; lung edema; metabolism; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Calcium; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pulmonary Edema; Respiration, Artificial; TRPV Cation Channels","32401673","Am.

He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any ”normal” post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D reconstruction; 3D visualisation; COVID-19; forensic pathology; SARS-COV-2; Virtopsy","adult; amputation; antibiotic therapy; Article; autopsy; bacterial infection; blindness; case report; cause of death; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; domestic violence; forensic pathology; government; health care policy; hearing impairment; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; image reconstruction; Italy; lung infection; male; middle aged; nonhuman; oxygen saturation; post mortem computed tomography; priority journal; quarantine; risk assessment; SARS coronavirus; SARS coronavirus 2; septicemia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Swiss; thorax pain",,"For.

A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 7000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious 2 weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias toward T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance, which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission, and maternal−fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery, is addressed. In addition, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment, and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework that can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","antiviral; baricitinib; chloroquine; coronavirus; COVID-19; fever; mask; MERS-CoV,morbidity; mortality; obstetric management; pandemic; pregnancy; remdesivir; respiratory distress syndrome; respiratory failure; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; sepsis; susceptibility; virus","antivirus agent; chloroquine; hydrocortisone; lopinavir plus ritonavir; methylprednisolone; remdesivir; ribavirin; antiviral therapy; Article; breast feeding; cardiovascular system; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic imaging; disease predisposition; disease surveillance; epidemic; human; immune system; labor; obstetric delivery; pandemic; pneumonia; prediction; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; prenatal care; priority journal; respiratory system; risk benefit analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment indication; vertical transmission; virology; virus transmission; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; female; obstetrics; pandemic; pregnancy; protective equipment; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Breast Feeding; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Obstetrics; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious","32217113","Am.

Its rapid expansion is dependent on the absence of previous exposure and immunity, the absence of a vaccine and specific treatments, as well as its mechanism of air transmission and contact with mucous membranes, including asymptomatic individuals. The need for protection on the population and its health professionals requires the establishment of exposure and prevention protocols. One of the new situations generated is the need for a safe return to normal healthcare activities, which in many cases are specific to each specialty. Objective: To elaborate a document of clinical and management recommendations to guide managers and staff of pain units on how to face the staggered return to normal care with the best available evidence. The document takes into account the safety of patients and professionals in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, although we recognize that the changing environment may change the recommendations in the near future. Methodology: After a narrative review of the literature on PubMed , Google Scholar, and recommendations of competent authorities and scientific societies, The Spanish Pain Society published a first document (V1.0) on April 21st 2020 into its WEB (www.sedolor. es), which was shared with the members of the society as well as the presidents of the Spanish autonomous pain societies, leaving open the possibility for improvement through an email posicionamiento.covid.sed@ sedolor.es, where suggestions have been received up to Version 2.1 published on May 13th, 2020. Some partners have also addressed the board of directors directly and their contributions have also been evaluated and incorporated when possible. This document is based on this latest version. Results: The document offers a series of general recommendations and others adapted to the different healthcare settings, from telematic assistance to the organization of physical consultation spaces, hospital care, interventional rooms and operating theaters. The recommendations cover from the hygienic measures and protection, to the diagnosis of the disease, risk categorization, the potential modifications in the pharmacological options and available analgesic techniques, as well as an accompanying document to the informed consent. Conclusions: A new healthcare reality is prevailing. This reality not only goes through security standards adapted to the contagiousness and other consequences of the virus, but also a new healthcare model that incorporates telematic tools with technological security and an adequate legal framework. The deleterious biological and psychological consequences of the virus on pain patients have not yet been fully clarified, so we must be vigilant, preventing and treating this possibility. © 2020 Revista de la Sociedad Espanola del Dolor.

Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rNbased IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days postdisease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness, 0 to 10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o. ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o., so it could be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.","Antibody; COVID-19 diagnosis; ELISA; IgG; IgM; Nucleocapsid protein; Spike protein","immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; nucleocapsid protein; virus antibody; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; antibody detection; Article; disease classification; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; feasibility study; general hospital; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; nonhuman; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunology; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","32229605","J.

Patients with cancer may have compromised immunity due to their malignancy and/or treatment, and may be at elevated risk of severe COVID-19. Community transmission of COVID-19 could overwhelm health care services, compromising delivery of cancer care. This interim consensus guidance provides advice for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the pandemic. Main recommendations: During the COVID-19 pandemic:. In patients with cancer with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, consider causes in addition to COVID-19, including other infections and therapy-related pneumonitis. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19, discuss temporary cessation of cancer therapy with a relevant specialist. Provide information on COVID-19 for patients and carers. Adopt measures within cancer centres to reduce risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition; support population-wide social distancing; reduce demand on acute services; ensure adequate staffing; and provide culturally safe care. Measures should be equitable, transparent and proportionate to the COVID-19 threat. Consider the risks and benefits of modifying cancer therapies due to COVID-19. Communicate treatment modifications, and review once health service capacity allows. Consider potential impacts of COVID-19 on the blood supply and availability of stem cell donors. Discuss and document goals of care, and involve palliative care services in contingency planning. Changes in management as a result of this statement: This interim consensus guidance provides a framework for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the rapidly changing situation, clinicians must also monitor national, state, local and institutional policies, which will take precedence.

Little information is known about nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family members. Methods: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological characteristics from 25 healthcare workers with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. Results: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5 days, the mean±SD clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.2±3.2 days, and the median virus shedding time was 18.5 days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they have symptoms, in both hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas. Besides this, healthcare workers should be alert during the epidemic and self-quarantine if self-suspected of infection. © 2020 ERS.",,"virus RNA; adult; aged; Article; China; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical onset serial interval; contact examination; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; demography; disease course; disease duration; disease severity; epidemic; family; female; health care personnel; hospital; hospital infection; human; incubation time; information processing; male; medical history; middle aged; priority journal; RNA sequencing; virus morphology; virus mutation; virus shedding; virus strain; virus transmission; whole genome sequencing; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; family; genetics; health care personnel; length of stay; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Family; Female; Health Personnel; Hospitals; Humans; Infectious Disease Incubation Period; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Virus Shedding; Whole Genome Sequencing","32366488","Eur.

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients’ being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","basic reproductive number; COVID-19; data fitting; data simulation; effective reproductive number; effectiveness; intervention; SARS-CoV-2; SEIR; sensitivity analysis; transmission","Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; curve fitting; early diagnosis; early intervention; geographic distribution; government; health care policy; hospital admission; human; infection control; infection prevention; isolation; major clinical study; mathematical model; safety procedure; SARS-related coronavirus; sensitivity analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulation; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; computer simulation; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; government regulation; organization and management; pandemic; pathogenicity; severity of illness index; social distance; statistical model; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Communicable Disease Control; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Susceptibility; Government Regulation; Humans; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Social Distance","32141624","J.

Results: The mechanism of action, cardiovascular effects, and possible toxicity of 10 plants frequently found in TCM formulations that were used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 were examined. Conclusion: TCM formulations that had been originally developed for earlier viral diseases have been used in COVID-19 treatment.

The number of confirmed cases, as April 11, surpassed 1,700,000, but this figure does not reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population as, in many countries, tests are almost exclusively performed in people with symptoms, particularly severe cases. To properly assess the magnitude of the problem and to contribute to the design of evidence-based policies for fighting COVID-19, one must accurately estimate the population prevalence of infection. Our study is aimed at estimating the prevalence of infected in-dividuals in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Bra-zil, to document how fast the infection spreads, and to estimate the proportion of infected persons who present or presented symptoms, as well as the proportion of asymptomatic infections. Four repeated serological surveys will be conducted in probability samples of nine sentinel cities ev-ery two weeks. Tests will be performed in 4,500 participants in each survey, totaling18,000 inter-views. Interviews and tests will be conducted at the participants’ household. A rapid test for the detection of antibodies will be used; the test was validated prior to the beginning of the fieldwork. © 2020, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number R0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R0 will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics. This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission. © 2020 The Author(s)","Asymptomatic transmission; Basic reproduction number; Coronavirus disease; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","Article; asymptomatic infection; basic reproduction number; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; time; virus transmission; asymptomatic disease; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Asymptomatic Diseases; Basic Reproduction Number; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32446187","Epidemics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084809331

Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available. Methods: A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced. Results: Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16–23] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19. Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21. He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21. His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively. Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index. None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months. For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1–4). The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0–4). Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission. All patients had mild conditions. Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission. As of February 20, four patients were discharged. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2-infection presented strong infectivity during the incubation-period with rapid transmission in this cluster of youngsters outside Wuhan. COVID-19 developed in these youngsters had fast onset and various nonspecific atypical manifestations, and were much milder than in older patients as previously reported. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Characteristics; Cluster of youngsters; COVID-19; Incubation period; Infectivity; Outside Wuhan; Prospective contact-tracing study; Rapid transmission","adenosine phosphate; amantadine; ambroxol; amoxicillin; arbidol; ceftazidime; levofloxacin; lopinavir; moxifloxacin; oseltamivir; paracetamol; recombinant alpha1b interferon; recombinant alpha2b interferon; recombinant interferon; ribavirin; ritonavir; unclassified drug; abdominal discomfort; adolescent; adult; Article; asymptomatic infection; backache; China; chronic gastritis; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dizziness; dyspnea; eye discomfort; fatigue; fatty liver; female; fever; headache; hospital patient; human; incubation time; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; male; neutropenia; nose obstruction; obesity; ocular pruritus; prospective study; quarantine; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; rhinorrhea; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sneezing; sore throat; sputum; virus infectivity; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; young adult; asymptomatic disease; Betacoronavirus; contact examination; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Asymptomatic Diseases; Betacoronavirus; China; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Young Adult","32283156","J.

Despite active control measures taken by the Chinese government, the number of infected patients is still increasing day by day. At present, the changing trend of the epidemic is attracting the attention of everyone. Based on data from 21 January to 20 February 2020, six rolling grey Verhulst models were built using 7-, 8-and 9-day data sequences to predict the daily growth trend of the number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 infection in China. The results show that these six models consistently predict the S-shaped change characteristics of the cumulative number of confirmed patients, and the daily growth decreased day by day after 4 February. The predicted results obtained by different models are very approximate, with very high prediction accuracy. In the training stage, the maximum and minimum mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 4.74% and 1.80%, respectively; in the testing stage, the maximum and minimum MAPEs are 4.72% and 1.65%, respectively. This indicates that the predicted results show high robustness. If the number of clinically diagnosed cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, where COVID-19 was first detected, is not counted from 12 February, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China will reach a maximum of 60,364–61,327 during 17–22 March; otherwise, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China will be 78,817–79,780. © 2020 by the authors.

Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths continue. Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. Process: The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted. The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care. An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize. Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed. For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles. The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations. Objectives: To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. Recommendations: A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions. © 2020, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.","Covid-19; Diagnosis; Labor; Management; Newborn; Outcome; Pregnancy; SARS-CoV-2","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; human; infection control; infection prevention; labor; newborn care; perinatal care; practice guideline; pregnant woman; resuscitation; travel; vertical transmission; virus diagnosis; virus transmission; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; gynecology; India; laboratory technique; medical society; neonatology; newborn; obstetrics; organization; pandemic; pediatrics; perinatal care; practice guideline; pregnancy; procedures; virus pneumonia; Academies and Institutes; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Gynecology; Humans; India; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Neonatology; Obstetrics; Pandemics; Pediatrics; Perinatal Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Societies, Medical","32238615","Indian Pediatr.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086792867

Objectives: To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. Study design: Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). Results: Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2–14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients Conclusions: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CD4+ counts; COVID-19; family aggregation; Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio; RT-PCR-CT values","adult; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; China; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dyspnea; family; fatigue; female; fever; human; incubation time; liver cirrhosis; male; middle aged; nausea; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nucleic acid analysis; platelet count; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus load; virus transmission; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; family health; hospitalization; immunology; neutrophil; pandemic; travel; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Betacoronavirus; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Family Health; Female; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophils; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Travel; Viral Load","32305025","J.

The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. Methods: In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. Findings: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. Interpretation: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. Results: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. Conclusion: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ARDS; Coagulopathy; COVID-19; Lupus anticoagulant; Thrombosis","antithrombin; blood clotting factor 5; blood clotting factor 8; D dimer; fibrinogen; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; lupus anticoagulant; remdesivir; von Willebrand factor; anticoagulant agent; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; abnormal value; activated partial thromboplastin time; acute limb ischemia; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; anticoagulant therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; blood clotting disorder; brain hematoma; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cardiogenic shock; case control study; cohort analysis; comparative study; continuous renal replacement therapy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; critical care outcome; critical illness; critically ill patient; deep vein thrombosis; disease severity; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; France; heart infarction; high risk patient; human; intensive care unit; internal carotid artery occlusion; international normalized ratio; limb ischemia; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; mesenteric ischemia; middle aged; multicenter study (topic); observational study; patient referral; platelet count; prognosis; propensity score; prospective study; prothrombin time; respiratory failure; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Simplified Acute Physiology Score; tertiary care center; thromboembolism; thrombosis; thrombosis prevention; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; complication; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; metabolism; mortality; multicenter study; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; thrombosis; virology; virus pneumonia; Aged; Anticoagulants; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Female; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; France; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Propensity Score; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Embolism; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Thrombosis","32367170","Intensive Care Med.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084748213

In the field of aesthetic surgery, the self-imposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures. Methods: We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of cross-contamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires. Conclusion: The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a risk-minimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed. We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic.

Rapid detection of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very important due to its high rate of infectivity. This study aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China, and to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19 in attempts to contain spread of the virus. Methods: This retrospective study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital (Changsha, China) between January 22 and February 15, 2020. All cases were detected using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The epidemiology and clinical characteristic of these cases were investigated according to outcome in attempts to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19. Results: There were 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the fever outpatient department of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital. Three patients were asymptomatic, and 3 exhibited mild and 3 moderate disease. There was a family cluster phenomenon. Conclusion: Individuals with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or exhibit mild manifestations of disease. Close monitoring and an optimized screening strategy for COVID-19 could help deter spread of the virus. © 2020","COVID-19; Screening strategies","C reactive protein; procalcitonin; adult; Article; asymptomatic infection; China; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; demography; dizziness; dyspnea; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; fatigue; female; fever; headache; human; leukocyte count; loss of appetite; lymphocyte count; male; myalgia; platelet count; practice guideline; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; screening; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; adolescent; aged; asymptomatic infection; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; middle aged; outpatient; pandemic; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asymptomatic Infections; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Fever; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Young Adult","32411310","J.

Although some developed countries have a very high testing rate and subsequently a high number of confirmed cases, less developed countries have a low testing rate and an illusive positivity rate. Collection of the upper respiratory specimen is not often comfortable. The discomfort could be accompanied with epistaxis and headache in some patients. The trained personnel taking the swab is forced to protect self with personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid infections that may result from the patient due to provoked cough, sneezing and spitting. This study looks into an efficient means of increasing the testing rate for COVID 19 without compromising the quality. A literature review was conducted on the different modalities of collecting upper respiratory specimens and assessing the efficacy of samples collected using different methods in terms of the laboratory yield of different pathogens. Selfcollection of upper respiratory tract specimen for diagnostic purposes is not new. Studies have demonstrated that trained staff-collected nasal swabs are not in any way superior to self-collected or parent-assisted swabs. The laboratory yield of different specimens is not determined by who took the sample but by the anatomical site from where the specimen was collected. Self collection of the upper respiratory swabs will not only increase the testing rate but also preserve the scarce PPE and reduces health care worker's COVID 19 infection rate in South Africa. © 2020.

Methods: Clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and chest CT images were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: The most common symptoms at Covid-19COVID-19 initial onset were fever (12/15, 80%) and cough (11/15, 73.3%). Most of the patients had a normal white blood cells (12/15, 80%), neutrophils (12/15, 80%), and lymphocytes count (13/15, 86.7%); some patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (5/15, 33.3%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (4/15, 26.7%) during first admission. Five patients (33.3%) had a cough before their first discharge. The average interval from the first discharge to readmission was 17 days (range, 9–30 days). At re-admission, two (13.3%) patients presented with cough, and one (6.6%) had chest pain with anxiety. At re-admission, all patients had normal clinical results except five (33.3%) patients had increased CRP compared with first discharging, two (13.3%) patients had increased neutrophils count, and one (6.6%) had increased CRP. The majority of patients had normal procalcitonin. Ground glass opacities (GGOs) and reticulation in the peripheral and subpleural areas were the most common CT manifestations, and six patients (40%) showed a transformation from reticulation to GGOs when re-admitted. Conclusions: There may be no specific clinical characteristics to predict the re-detectability of the virus.

Currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early recognition of patients at high risk is important. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We compared the effectiveness of three scoring systems: the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) systems, for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used for these assessments, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to identify the cumulative risk for 28-day mortality according to the NEWS stratification. Results: For predicting 28-day mortality, NEWS was superior to qSOFA (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.779, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between NEWS and SIRS (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.639, P = 0.100). For predicting critical outcomes, NEWS was superior to both SIRS (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.744, P = 0.032) and qSOFA (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.760, P = 0.012). Survival time was significantly shorter for patients with NEWS ≥ 7 than for patients with NEWS < 7. Conclusion: Calculation of the NEWS at the time of hospital admission can predict critical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Early intervention for high-risk patients can thereby improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","COVID-19; NEWS; Outcome; Prediction","aged; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; deterioration; early diagnosis; female; human; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; mortality; multiple organ failure; organ dysfunction score; pandemic; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Deterioration; Coronavirus Infections; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Organ Failure; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies","32597046","J.

Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19. In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management. This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus. Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources. The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures. © 2020","COVID-19; Department; Epidemic; Organization; Patient; Radiotherapy","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; experience; France; health care access; health care facility; human; infection control; infection prevention; medical staff; nonhuman; pandemic; paramedical personnel; practice guideline; priority journal; radiotherapy; radiotherapy center; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; total quality management; viral contamination; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; cancer center; clinical protocol; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; health care quality; neoplasm; occupational disease; organization and management; pandemic; patient care; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cancer Care Facilities; Clinical Protocols; Continuity of Patient Care; Coronavirus Infections; France; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Neoplasms; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Health Care","32334905","Cancer Radiother.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083507894

The position paper is based on the current knowledge that is evolving daily. Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies. This position paper is structured into the following five topics: 1. Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-2 2. Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease 3. Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation 4. Non-invasive ventilation in ARI 5. Supply continuum for the treatment of ARI Key points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations. Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase. There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria. In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase. This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI. The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled. In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place. In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO 2. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

We report here the description of a multicenter retrospective-prospective observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN), involving the Italian Neurological Departments, who will consecutively recruit patients with neurological symptoms and/or signs, occurred at the onset or as a complication of COVID-19. Hospitalized patients will be recruited either in neurological wards or in COVID wards; in the latter cases, they will be referred from other specialists to participant neurologists. Outpatients with clinical signs of COVID and neurological manifestations will be also referred to participating neurologists from primary care physicians. A comprehensive data collection, in the form of electronic case report form (eCRF), will register all possible neurological manifestations involving central nervous systems, peripheral nerves, and muscles, together with clinical, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid, if available), imaging, neurological, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological data. A follow-up at hospital discharge (in hospitalized patients), and for all patients after 3 and 6 months, is also planned. We believe that this study may help to intercept the full spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and, given the large diffusion at national level, can provide a large cohort of patients available for future more focused investigations. Similar observational studies might also be proposed at international level to better define the neurological involvement of COVID-19. © 2020, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.","COVID-19; NEUROCOVID; Neurological manifestations; Observational study","Article; central nervous system disease; cerebrospinal fluid examination; clinical laboratory; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; follow up; general practitioner; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; Italy; medical specialist; multicenter study; neuroimaging; neurological complication; neurologist; neuromuscular disease; observational study; outpatient; peripheral neuropathy; prospective study; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Italy; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies","32430621","Neurol.

As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions. During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners could consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms). © 2020 British Contact Lens Association","contact lens; COVID-19; lens care; lens wear","Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; exposure; eye care; hand washing; health care access; health service; human; infection risk; optometry; pandemic; physician; prescription; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; contact lens; Coronavirus infection; cross infection; disease transmission; infection control; prevention and control; procedures; professional practice; virus pneumonia; contact lens solution; Betacoronavirus; Contact Lens Solutions; Contact Lenses; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Hand Hygiene; Humans; Infection Control; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Professional Practice","32273245","Contact Lens Anterior Eye",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082778515

With the ongoing need for urgent and emergency colorectal surgery, including surgery for colorectal cancer, several questions pertaining to operating room (OR) utilization and techniques needed to be rapidly addressed. Method: This manuscript discusses knowledge related to the critical considerations of patient and caregiver safety relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) and the operating room environment. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required contingent upon local availability of COVID-19 testing and the incidence of known COVID-19 infection in the respective community. In addition to standard COVID-19 PPE precautions, a negative-pressure environment, including an OR, has been recommended, especially for the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Hospital spaces ranging from patient wards to ORs to endoscopy rooms have been successfully converted from standard positive-pressure to negative-pressure spaces. Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered. Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles. Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management. Conclusion: This paper evaluates the issues surrounding these challenges including the OR environment and AGPs which are germane to surgical practices around the world. Although there is no single universally agreed upon set of answers, we have presented what we think is a balanced cogent description of logical safe approaches to colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been documented recently. However, information on pediatric patients is limited. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric patients to provide valuable insight into the early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 in children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective, observational study involves a case series performed at 4 hospitals in West China. Thirty-four pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 27 to February 23, 2020. The final follow-up visit was completed by March 16, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed for 34 pediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, interquartile range 10.00-94.25), among whom 14 males (41%) were included. All the patients in the current study presented mild (18%) or moderate (82%) forms of COVID-19. A total of 48% of patients were noted to be without a history of exposure to an identified source. Mixed infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47%). Comorbidities were reported in 6 patients (18%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76%) and cough (62%). Expectoration (21%), vomiting (12%), and diarrhea (12%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A substantial increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (among 20 patients with available data; 85%) and in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (among 29 patients with available data; 59%), whereas a decrease in prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (among 32 patients with available data; 78%). In addition, significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were detected in 28 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 82%) and 25 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 74%), respectively. Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82%). Ground-glass opacities, which were a typical feature in adults, were rare in pediatric patients (3%). Rapid radiologic progression and a late-onset pattern of lesions in the lobules were also noticed. Lesions in lobules still existed in 24 (among 32 patients with lesions; 75%) patients that were discharged, although the main symptoms disappeared a few days after treatment. All patients were discharged, and the median duration of hospitalization was 10.00 (8.00-14.25) days. The current study was limited by the small sample size and a lack of dynamic detection of inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data systemically presented the clinical and epidemiological features, as well as the outcomes, of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Stratified analysis was performed between mild and moderate cases. The findings offer new insight into early identification and intervention in pediatric patients with COVID-19.",,"2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; C reactive protein; hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase; serum amyloid A; transthyretin; Betacoronavirus; child; China; clinical trial; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diagnostic imaging; diarrhea; female; fever; human; infant; length of stay; lung; male; metabolism; mixed infection; multicenter study; pandemic; pathophysiology; preschool child; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; vomiting; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; C-Reactive Protein; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coinfection; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Diarrhea; Female; Fever; Humans; Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase; Infant; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Length of Stay; Lung; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prealbumin; Retrospective Studies; Serum Amyloid A Protein; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vomiting","32544155","PLoS Med.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086622903

Methods: This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study. A total of 95 patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled. The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction detection of target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained. ARDS was defined as an oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) ≤300 mm Hg. Findings: Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; p = 0.008) and high body mass index (OR, 1.327; p = 0.024) were independent risk factors associated with patients with pneumonia. For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.046; p = 0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase level (OR, 1.010; p = 0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients underwent CT imaging repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in a disease exacerbation group (n = 19) and a disease relief group (n = 51).

To accelerate our understanding of the host-pathogen response to respiratory viruses, the use of more complex in vitro systems such as normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell culture models has gained prominence as an alternative to animal models. NHBE cells were differentiated under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions to form an in vitro pseudostratified epithelium. The responses of well-differentiated (wd) NHBE cells were examined following infection with the 2009 pandemic Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strain or following challenge with the dsRNA mimic, poly(I:C). At 30 h postinfection with H1N1pdm09, the integrity of the airway epithelium was severely impaired and apical junction complex damage was exhibited by the disassembly of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) from the cell cytoskeleton. wdNHBE cells produced an innate immune response to IAV-infection with increased transcription of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the antiviral viperin but reduced expression of the mucin-encoding MUC5B, which may impair mucociliary clearance. Poly(I:C) produced similar responses to IAV, with the exception of MUC5B expression which was more than 3-fold higher than for control cells. This study demonstrates that wdNHBE cells are an appropriate ex-vivo model system to investigate the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses. ©2020 by the authors.","antiviral; cell death; chemokine; cytokine; cytoskeleton; epithelium; inflammation; innate immune system; lung; tight junction","ademetionine; beta1 interferon; colony stimulating factor; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lactate dehydrogenase; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mucin 5AC; mucin 5B; RANTES; tumor necrosis factor; chemokine; cytokine; MUC5AC protein, human; mucin 5AC; animal cell; Article; bioinformatics; cell culture; cell damage; cell membrane permeability; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA synthesis; electric resistance; enzyme release; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gene expression; HBEC cell line (bronchial epithelium); host pathogen interaction; human; human cell; immunoassay; immunocytochemistry; infection rate; influenza A; Influenza A virus (H1N1); MDCK cell line; nonhuman; respiratory epithelium; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; transwell assay; TUNEL assay; virus load; animal; biological model; bronchus; cell junction; cytology; dog; host pathogen interaction; immunology; influenza; innate immunity; metabolism; pandemic; physiology; respiratory mucosa; virology; virus culture; Animals; Bronchi; Cells, Cultured; Chemokines; Cytokines; Dogs; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Intercellular Junctions; Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells; Models, Biological; Mucin 5AC; Pandemics; Respiratory Mucosa; Virus Cultivation","32599823","Viruses",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087430375

In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease. We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are expressed in the intestine. We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage. Methods: We examined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 by quantitative polymerase chain reacion in animal models of IBD. Publicly available data from organoids and mucosal biopsies from patients with IBD were examined for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We conducted RNA sequencing for CD11b-enriched cells and peripheral and lamina propria T-cells from well-annotated patient samples. Results: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundantly expressed in the ileum and colon and had high expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In animal models, inflammation led to downregulation of epithelial Ace2. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not increased in samples from patients with compared with those of control patients. In CD11b-enriched cells but not T-cells, the level of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mucosa was comparable to other functional mucosal genes and was not affected by inflammation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and steroids were linked to significantly lower expression of ACE2 in CD11b-enriched cells. Conclusions: The viral entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and colon. Patients with IBD do not have higher expression during inflammation; medical therapy is associated with lower levels of ACE2. These data provide reassurance for patients with IBD. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%).

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Deep learning; Radiology images","Diagnosis; Imaging techniques; Object detection; Viruses; Automated detection; Binary classification; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Devastating effects; Multi-class classification; Object detection systems; Radiological imaging; Deep neural networks; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; artificial intelligence; binary classification; computer assisted diagnosis; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; feature extraction; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiclass classification; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; biology; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; lung; pandemic; pneumonia; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computational Biology; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","32568675","Comput.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed over the recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called Transfer Learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep Learning with X-ray imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively.

Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases. Methods: and findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases. Results: Our data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2 = 0.92, p = 0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2 = 0.98, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights. © 2020","Air traffic; China; Coronavirus; COVID-19; International flights; Pandemic","access to information; Article; aviation; China; Chinese; coronavirus disease 2019; Europe; human; outcome assessment; pandemic; population size; risk factor; traffic; travel; virus transmission; World Health Organization; aviation; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; public health; virus pneumonia; Air Travel; China; Communicable Diseases, Imported; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","32299783","J.

The prevalence of COVID-19 in children has been reported much lower than adults. Most patients have mild symptoms, whereas some cases are asymptomatic. Information on the pediatric clinical manifestations is limited; therefore, reporting specific cases can improve the diagnosis process. Case Presentation: In this article, we reported a 12-year-old boy with chickenpox and COVID-19 at the same time. The patient initially had symptoms of chickenpox and then developed pneumonia. The PCR-test for COVID-19 was positive. The IgM test was positive, and IgG was negative. Chickenpox infection was confirmed by the serological test (positive IgM). The radiographic results showed reverse halo sign and vascular enlargement. Conclusions: These imaging findings are uncommon signs of COVID-19 in pediatrics. The patient was treated with hydroxychloro-quine and azithromycin and discharged a few days later with good condition. © 2020, Author(s).","COVId-19; Pediatric; Reverse Halo Sign; Varicella-Zoster","aciclovir; azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin M; paracetamol; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; case report; chickenpox; child; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; fever; human; male; mixed infection; polymerase chain reaction; school child; serology; skin defect; thorax pain; virus pneumonia",,"Arch.

The objective of this study is to summarize China's countermeasures and experience in response to the COVID-19 emergence in order to serve as a warning for the global COVID-19 prevention and control, and further provide some suggestions for global fighting to COVID-19. Methods Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. Results As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldn't be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance. High frequent words of experts' suggestions mainly includes: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy, panic, etc. The main concerns of experts are from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. Conclusions COVID-19 is a new infectious disease worldwide, and its infectious source, transmission route, susceptible population, and therapy are not clear. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone to maintain its own safety. People from all over the world should put aside their difference in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy, and culture, and only by global cooperation and globally unified actions, can we successfully overcome COVID-19 in the end. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32509294","J.

According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. Objective: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. Methods: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. Results: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). Conclusions: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Maps of crude and estimated values (global and local Bayesian method) were developed, calculating the Moran index and using BoxMap and MoranMap. Intensive care beds were distributed through geolocal-ized points. In total, 3,000 cases and 459 beds were studied. The highest rates were found in the capital Fortaleza, the Metropolitan Region (MR), and the south of this region. A positive spatial autocor-relation has been identified in the local Bayesian rate (I = 0.66). The distribution of beds superim-posed on the BoxMap shows clusters with a High-High pattern of number of beds (capital, MR, northwestern part). However, a similar pattern is found in the far east or transition areas with insufficient beds. The MoranMap shows clusters statistically significant in the state.

No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. Method: In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. Result: The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was −1.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6–24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2−43.0. Conclusion: The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes. © 2020","Consistency; COVID-19; Lung CT; Nucleic acid; Sensitivity","nucleic acid; virus DNA; Article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; gold standard; human; lung examination; major clinical study; male; nucleic acid analysis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; throat culture; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; lung; middle aged; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; pharynx; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; DNA, Viral; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","32302956","J.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. Aim and methods: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. Results: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment. © 2020","Anticancer chemotherapy; Children; COVID-19; Immunosuppression","antileukemic agent; antineoplastic agent; azithromycin; cisplatin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; antineoplastic agent; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adjuvant chemotherapy; adolescent; antibiotic therapy; Article; asymptomatic infection; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer therapy; case report; child; childhood cancer; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease course; disease severity; drug withdrawal; Ewing sarcoma; febrile neutropenia; female; fever; flash survey; follow up; hepatoblastoma; high risk patient; human; immunocompromised patient; incidence; infection prevention; maintenance chemotherapy; major clinical study; male; mediastinum cancer; metastasis; methodology; multiple cycle treatment; nephroblastoma; osteosarcoma; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; rhabdoid tumor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment interruption; uterine cervix cancer; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; pandemic; questionnaire; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Antineoplastic Agents; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","32305831","Eur.

Methods: The clinical features and outcomes of 10 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a tertiary- care teaching hospital in Hubei province, Wuhan, China from January 23 to February 23, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: All the 10 observed pregnant women including 9 singletons and 1 twin were native people in Wuhan. All of them were diagnosed mild COVID-19, and none of the patients developed severe COVID-19 or died. Among the 10 patients, two patients underwent vaginal delivery, two patients underwent intrapartum cesarean section, and the remaining six patients underwent elective cesarean section. All of 10 patients showed lung abnormalities by pulmonary CT images after delivery. Their eleven newborns were recorded and no neonatal asphyxia was observed. Conclusions: Pulmonary CT screening on admission may be necessary to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 during the outbreak period.

Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months. Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department. A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19. Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection. The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training. Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission. The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues. © 2020 American College of Radiology","Coronavirus; COVID-19; mass casualty; novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia; preparedness; radiology","Article; clinical protocol; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency ward; epidemic; follow up; human; in service training; mass disaster; medical education; nonhuman; radiology department; virus transmission; World Health Organization; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; disaster planning; female; global health; health care planning; health service; male; mass disaster; organization and management; pandemic; radiology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Coronavirus Infections; Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks; Education, Medical, Continuing; Female; Global Health; Health Planning; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Male; Mass Casualty Incidents; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; World Health Organization","32304643","J.

The susceptible–exposed–infectious/asymptomatic–recovered social distancing (SEIAR-SD) model, an extended application of the original Kermack–McKendrick and Fred Brauer models, was developed to predict the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its progression and duration in the state of Rajasthan, India. Objective: The study aimed at developing a mathematical model, the SEIAR-SD model, of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state of Rajasthan, for predicting the number of cases, progression of the pandemic and its duration. Materials and methods: The SEIAR-SD model was applied for different values of population proportion, symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and social distancing parameters to evaluate the effect of variations in the number of infected persons, size of the pandemic and its duration, with value of other parameters fixed in the model. Actual reported cases were plotted and juxtaposed on the prediction models for comparison. Results: Social distancing was the crucial determinant of the magnitude of COVID-19 cases, the progression of the pandemic and its duration. In the absence of any proven treatment or vaccine, effective social distancing would reduce the number of infections and shorten the peak and duration of the pandemic. Loosening social distancing will increase the number of cases and lead to a heightened peak and prolonged duration of the pandemic. Conclusions: In the absence of an effective treatment or a vaccine against COVID-19, social distancing (lockdown) and public health interventions—case detection with testing and isolation, contact tracing and quarantining—will be crucial for the prevention of the spread of the pandemic and for saving lives. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","COVID-19 pandemic; mathematical model; SEIAR-SD predictive modelling; social distancing",,,"J.

Therefore, this study was designed with the aim to address the issue of public response against COVID-19. The literature lacks studies on social aspects of COVID-19. Therefore, the current study is an attempt to investigate its social aspects and suggest a theoretical structural equation model to examine the associations between social media exposure, awareness, and information exchange and preventive behavior and to determine the indirect as well as direct impact of social media exposure on preventive behavior from the viewpoints of awareness and information exchange. The current empirical investigation was held in Pakistan, and the collected survey data from 500 respondents through social media tools were utilized to examine the associations between studied variables as stated in the anticipated study model. The findings of the study indicate that social media exposure has no significant and direct effect on preventive behavior. Social media exposure influences preventive behavior indirectly through awareness and information exchange. In addition, awareness and information exchange have significant and direct effects on preventive behavior. Findings are valuable for health administrators, governments, policymakers, and social scientists, specifically for individuals whose situations are like those in Pakistan. This research validates how social media exposure indirectly effects preventive behavior concerning COVID-19 and explains the paths of effect through awareness or information exchange. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work at present that covers this gap, for this reason the authors propose a new model. The conceptual model offers valuable information for policymakers and practitioners to enhance preventive behavior through the adoption of appropriate awareness strategies and information exchange and social media strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

All COVID-19-affected countries in the world are implementing containment interventions and trying their best to fight against the disease to halt the further spread of the infection and to reduce mortality. The public health workforce and healthcare staff in clinical settings are playing a crucial role in the early detection of cases, contact tracing and treatment of patients. The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and their consistent, proper use by healthcare providers and public health professionals is a crucial factor in combating any infectious disease in a crisis. The requirement of PPE has exponentially increased, as more and more countries are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid spread of the pandemic has created a temporary shortage of PPE in many countries, including India. The lack of PPE has affected the morale of healthcare workers (HCWs) and other frontline warriors in fighting the coronavirus disease, as more than 22,000 health workers in 56 countries have suffered from COVID-19. Some of them have succumbed to it across all countries, including India (WHO). We have reviewed the available literature to understand the challenges in ensuring adequate availability and consistent use of PPE and the strategies for the rational use of PPE in India. Our study reveals that India has responded swiftly to enhance the accessibility of PPE and put in place strategies for the judicious use of PPE to reduce the incidence of the COVID-19 infection to a bare minimum in healthcare settings. In the present article, we report the current status of COVID-19 among HCWs. We have reviewed the challenges and the surge strategies adopted by India to produce or procure good-quality PPE and supply it to all service delivery points in adequate quantities. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","coronavirus; COVID-19; healthcare worker; India; Personal protective equipment; PPE",,,"J.

From February 21 to March 21, 2020, of 672 suspected COVID-19 patients from two centers who underwent CT, 45 RT-PCR-positives (28 males, median age 75, IQR 66–81 years) with previous CTs performed a median 36 months before (IQR 12–72 months) were included. We assessed PnE, pulmonary artery (PA) diameter, ascending aorta (Ao) diameter, and PA/ Ao ratio. Most common presentations were fever and dyspnea (15/45) and fever alone (13/45). Outcome was available for 41/45 patients, 15/41 dead and 26/41 discharged. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) alone were found in 29/45 patients, GGOs with consolidations in 15/45, consolidations alone in 1/45. All but one patient had bilateral pneumonia, 9/45 minimal, 22/45 mild, 9/45 moderate, and 5/45 severe PnE. PA diameter (median 31 mm, IQR 28–33 mm) was larger than before (26 mm, IQR 25–29 mm) (P<0.001), PA/ Ao ratio (median 0.83, IQR 0.76–0.92) was higher than before (0.76, IQR 0.72–0.82) (P<0.001). Patients with adverse outcome (death) had higher PA diameter (P=0.001), compared to discharged ones. Only weak correlations were found between ΔPA or ΔPA/Ao and PnE (ρ≤0.453, P≤0.032), with 4/45 cases with moderate-severe PnE and minimal increase in PA metrics. In conclusion, enlarged PA diameter was associated to death in COVID-19 patients, a finding deserving further investigation as a potential driver of therapy decision-making. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for severe COVID-19, there have been no such studies in Korea. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, Korea. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Severe disease was defined as a composite outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit care, or death. Results: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 19.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-193.42; P = 0.012), body temperature ≥ 37.8°C (OR, 10.91; 95% CI, 1.35-88.36; P = 0.025), peripheral oxygen saturation < 92% (OR, 33.31; 95% CI, 2.45-452.22; P = 0.008), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) > 6.3 (OR, 56.84; 95% CI, 2.64-1,223.78, P = 0.010) at admission were associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. The likelihood of development of severe COVID-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that diabetes mellitus, body temperature ≥ 37.8°C, peripheral oxygen saturation < 92%, and CK-MB > 6.3 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Appropriate assessment of prognostic factors and close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the appropriate time in high-risk patients may reduce the case fatality rate of COVID-19. © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","COVID-19; Korea; Prognostic factor; Severe disease","adolescent; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; female; fever; hospitalization; human; hypoxia; infant; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; newborn; pandemic; pathology; preschool child; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; South Korea; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Hypoxia; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult","32537954","J.

The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) and case fatality rates (CFR) in Europe. Methods: Data for this study were obtained mainly from the World Health Organization website, up to March 9, 2020. R(t) were estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time-dependent (TD) methods. ‘R0’ package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both the naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjusted CFR (aCFR) were estimated. Results: With the EG method, R(t) was 3.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.17–3.38) for Italy, 6.32 (95% CI 5.72–6.99) for France, 6.07 (95% CI 5.51–6.69) for Germany, and 5.08 (95% CI 4.51–5.74) for Spain. With the TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 (95% CI 2.21–4.11) for Italy, 6.56 (95% CI 2.04–12.26) for France, 4.43 (95% CI 1.83–7.92) for Germany, and 3.95 (95% CI 0–10.19) for Spain. Conclusions: This study provides important findings on the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe.

Non-emergency endoscopic activity in the UK has been postponed, raising concerns of increased delays in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and a surge in demand once services resume. Measures to mitigate this risk must be considered. Method: This paper reviews various investigative modalities for colorectal disease which could be deployed during cessation of colonoscopy services. We focus on colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) due to its relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ability to triage patients effectively to further endoscopic investigations. Results: CT of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested as a triage tool while access to colonoscopy is limited. However, CT may lead to the spread of COVID-19 as patients attend the hospital, and it exposes them to the risks of radiation. Faecal immunochemistry tests have been demonstrated as a good predictor of colonic pathology and could be safely used to risk stratify patients when prioritizing colonoscopy. CCE is a safe and innovative technology for investigating the colon. Procedures can be carried out in the community and can be conducted safely during the coronavirus pandemic. It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy. Conclusion: As colonoscopy services resume, they will probably experience high demand leading to further delays for patients. CCE could be used to reduce the number of patients requiring colonoscopy and triage those requiring further endoscopic investigations appropriately.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Design, setting, and participants: A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study. In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. Intervention: Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. Results and limitations: The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 ± 9.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 ± 8.3 vs 18.8 ± 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment. One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure. Conclusions: Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding. Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations. Patient summary: Immunosuppressed transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia, but most of them still achieved a good prognosis after appropriate treatment. Immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia than the general population. Most patients could recover following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use, low-dose methylprednisolone therapy, and protection of renal graft function. © 2020 European Association of Urology","Coronavirus disease 2019; Immunosuppression; Kidney transplantation; Outcome; Pneumonia","methylprednisolone; antivirus agent; glucocorticoid; immunosuppressive agent; methylprednisolone; adult; aged; Article; China; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease severity; female; graft failure; graft recipient; human; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney transplantation; low drug dose; male; middle aged; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory failure; retrospective study; virus shedding; young adult; adverse event; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; immunocompromised patient; immunology; isolation and purification; kidney transplantation; laboratory technique; mortality; noninvasive ventilation; opportunistic infection; oxygen therapy; pandemic; predictive value; risk factor; severity of illness index; time factor; treatment outcome; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Immunosuppressive Agents; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Methylprednisolone; Middle Aged; Noninvasive Ventilation; Opportunistic Infections; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Transplant Recipients; Treatment Outcome; Virus Shedding; Young Adult","32317180","Eur.

Articles on the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 were selected from the PubMed, medRXiv and bioRvix data-bases. Federal and state legislation was analyzed to summarize the strategies implemented in Bra-zil. Social distancing measures adopted by the population appear effective, particularly when implemented in conjunction with the isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts. Therefore, social distancing measures, and social protection policies to guarantee the sustainability of these measures, should be implemented. To control COVID-19 in Brazil, it is also crucial that epide-miological monitoring is strengthened at all three levels of the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).

Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 140 patients with moderate to critical COVID-19–associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted to the hospital from January 28, 2020, through February 28, 2020, and followed up through March 13, 2020, in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. Results: Of 140 patients with COVID-19–associated pneumonia, 72 (51.4%) were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 values of 90% or less were older and were more likely to be men, to have hypertension, and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 values greater than 90%. Overall, 36 patients (25.7%) died during hospitalization after median 14-day follow-up. Higher SpO2 levels after oxygen supplementation were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-U SpO2, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.95; P&lt;.001). The SpO2 cutoff value of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.43; P=.01). Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with COVID-19, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide the clinical management of patients with severe COVID-19, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.

An evidence-based symptom criteria for identifying HCWs for testing, based on the probability of positive COVID-19 test results, would allow for a more appropriate use of testing resources. Methods: This was an observational study of outpatient COVID-19 testing of HCWs. Prior to testing, HCWs were asked about the presence of 10 symptoms. Their responses were then compared to their subsequent pharyngeal swab COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test results. These data were used to derive and evaluate a symptom-based testing criteria. Results: A total of 961 HCWs were included in the analysis, of whom 225 (23%) had positive test results. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom with the largest positive likelihood ratio (3.33). Dry cough, regardless of the presence or absence of other symptoms, was the most sensitive (74%) and the least specific (32%) symptom. The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (area unce the curve [AUC] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.67). The derived testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of two symptoms (fever, loss of taste or smell) was 89% sensitive and 48% specific (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.78). The hybrid testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of four symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, loss of taste or smell) was 98% sensitive and 8% specific (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.80). Conclusion: An evidence-based approach to COVID-19 testing that at least includes fever and loss of taste or smell should be utilized when determining which HCWs should be tested. © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",,"anosmia; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diagnostic test accuracy study; diarrhea; dyspnea; fatigue; fever; health care personnel; human; loss of appetite; major clinical study; observational study; outpatient care; polymerase chain reaction; predictive value; priority journal; return to work; sensitivity and specificity; sore throat; symptom assessment; taste disorder; throat culture; ageusia; anorexia; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diarrhea; dyspnea; fatigue; fever; laboratory technique; myalgia; pandemic; pathophysiology; pharyngitis; smelling disorder; virus pneumonia; Ageusia; Anorexia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Diarrhea; Dyspnea; Fatigue; Fever; Health Personnel; Humans; Myalgia; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pharyngitis; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction","32396670","Acad.

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited. Objectives: This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment. Study design: This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. Results: Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as mean ± standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39 ± 18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32 ± 6.70 days), and laboratory indicators. We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were p < 0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were p < 0.05. Conclusions: We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients. Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment. © 2020 The Author(s)","Chengdu; Clinical features; COVID-19; Critical illness; Epidemiological characteristics","alanine aminotransferase; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; creatine kinase MB; D dimer; fibrin degradation product; myoglobin; troponin T; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; case study; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD8 lymphocyte count; child; China; clinical feature; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; critical care outcome; critical illness; critically ill patient; demography; dry cough; early diagnosis; fatigue; female; fever; follow up; hospital patient; human; infant; laboratory test; length of stay; leukocyte; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil count; patient identification; priority journal; prognosis; prothrombin time; retrospective study; social behavior; thorax radiography; travel; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; hospitalization; middle aged; pandemic; pathophysiology; preschool child; treatment outcome; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Critical Illness; Fatigue; Female; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","32302954","J.

In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. Objective: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. Results: During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19-related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related news. Conclusions: Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exerted a negative impact on dental practices. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the nature and diffusion of COVID-19-related oral health information on the Chinese social media site Weibo. Methods: A total of 15,900 tweets related to oral health and dentistry information from Weibo during the COVID-19 outbreak in China (December 31, 2019, to March 16, 2020) were included in our study. Two researchers coded 1000 of the total tweets in advance, and two main thematic categories with eight subtypes were refined. The included tweets were analyzed over time and geographic region, and coded into eight thematic categories. Additionally, the time distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care during the COVID-19 epidemic were further analyzed. Results: People reacted rapidly to the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 threat to dental services, and a large amount of COVID-19-related oral health information was tweeted on Weibo. The time and geographic distribution of tweets shared similarities with epidemiological data of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Tweets containing home oral care and dental services content were the most frequently exchanged information (n=4803/15,900, 30.20% and n=4478, 28.16%, respectively). Significant differences of public attention were found between various types of bloggers in dental services-related tweets (P<.001), and the tweets from the government and media engaged the most public attention. The distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care information dynamically changed with time. Conclusions: Our study overviewed and analyzed social media data on the dental services and oral health information during the COVID-19 epidemic, thus, providing insights for government organizations, media, and dental professionals to better facilitate oral health communication and efficiently shape public concern through social media when routine dental services are unavailable during an unprecedented event. The study of the nature and distribution of social media can serve as a useful adjunct tool to help make public health policies. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The dromedary camel is considered a possible host of the virus and also to act as a reservoir, transmitting the virus to humans. Here, we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses, including eight newly sequenced MERS-CoV genomes isolated from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%. Our results suggest that the virus circulates by way of camels crossing the borders of Arabian Gulf countries. This study contributes to finding more effective vaccines in order to provide long-term protection against MERS-CoV and identifying neutralizing antibodies. © 2020 by the authors.","2019-nCov; Dromedary camel; MERS-CoV; Phylogenetic analysis; Vaccine design","epitope; neutralizing antibody; virus spike protein; complementary DNA; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; virus DNA; virus RNA; Article; Betacoronavirus; binding affinity; bioinformatics; controlled study; convergent evolution; dromedary; evolution; gene library; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; geographic distribution; Markov chain; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; nose smear; open reading frame; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract disease; RNA extraction; Sanger sequencing; Saudi Arabia; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sequence homology; virus isolation; amino acid sequence; animal; camel; chemistry; classification; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; isolation and purification; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Biological Evolution; Camelus; Coronavirus Infections; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Viral; Epitopes; Gene Library; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Phylogeny; RNA, Viral; Saudi Arabia; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","32503352","Viruses",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086051211

We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed. Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy. The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized. Results: Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread. It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment. Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively. When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised. Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules. Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery. These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk of spreading the virus. It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels. A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided. Conclusion: Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking. Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.

Individuals at CHR may be prone to exacerbated psychological distress during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its subsequent physical isolation measures, as a result of heightened stress sensitivity and comorbid mental health problems. Telepsychotherapy holds promise for reaching this population, especially during the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, there are limited evidence-based guidelines or interventions for use of telepsychotherapy with this population. In this article, we review common clinical issues for individuals at CHR and how they might be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We then review best practices for treatment and adaptations for telepsychotherapy for individuals at CHR, and highlight real clinical issues that we are currently experiencing in a United States- based specialized CHR clinic as we conduct telepsychotherapy via videoconferencing.

As countries reach the infection peak, it is planned to return a new normal under different coexistence conditions in order to reduce the economic effects produced by the total or partial closure of companies, universities, shops, etc. Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in various facilities represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. On the other hand, agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach to model complex systems composed of agents whose behavior is described using simple rules. Different from classical mathematical models (which consider a homogenous population), agent-based approaches model individuals with distinct characteristics and provide more realistic results. In this paper, an agent-based model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. The proposed scheme has been designed to simulate the spatiotemporal transmission process. In the model, simulated agents make decisions depending on the programmed rules. Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. The model also includes an individual profile for each agent, which defines its main social characteristics and health conditions used during its interactions. In general, this profile partially determines the behavior of the agent during its interactions with other individuals. Several hypothetical scenarios have been considered to show the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results have demonstrated that the simulations provide useful information to produce strategies for reducing the transmission risks of COVID-19 within the facilities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling; COVID-19; Transmission models","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Plant shutdowns; Simulation platform; Agent-based approach; Agent-based model; Global threats; Health condition; Informed decision; Partial closures; Simulated agents; Spatial patterns; Transmissions; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; health behavior; health care facility; human; infection risk; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; social aspect; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; biological model; biology; computer simulation; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; health care facility; pandemic; population dynamics; system analysis; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Susceptibility; Health Behavior; Health Facilities; Humans; Models, Biological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Dynamics; Systems Analysis","32568667","Comput.

We aimed to validate the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S) and examine the association of its scores with health literacy and health-related behaviors among medical students. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 7 to 29 April 2020 on 5423 students at eight universities across Vietnam, including five universities in the North, one university in the Center, two universities in the South. An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data on participants’ characteristics, health literacy, fear of COVID-19 using the FCoV-19S, and health-related behaviors. The results showed that seven items of the FCoV-19S strongly loaded on one component, explained 62.15% of the variance, with good item–scale convergent validity and high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90). Higher health literacy was associated with lower FCoV-19S scores (coefficient, B, −0.06; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, −0.08, −0.04; p < 0.001). Older age or last academic years, being men, and being able to pay for medication were associated with lower FCoV-19S scores. Students with higher FCoV-19S scores more likely kept smoking (odds ratio, OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.14; p < 0.001) or drinking alcohol (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.06; p < 0.001) at an unchanged or higher level during the pandemic, as compared to students with lower FCoV-19S scores. In conclusion, the FCoV-19S is valid and reliable in screening for fear of COVID-19. Health literacy was found to protect medical students from fear. Smoking and drinking appeared to have a negative impact on fear of COVID-19. Strategic public health approaches are required to reduce fear and promote healthy lifestyles during the pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Beginning in China, it has within a few months devastated many countries around the globe, requiring an unprecedented mobilisation of health systems. While the disease caused by this novel virus is generally mild and self-limiting, the risk of severe disease is disproportionately high among elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. In the absence of a vaccine or treatment, the public health strategies include: (a) preventing transmission through early detection and isolation, tracing contacts and quarantining them and implementation of measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene and (b) reducing mortality by augmenting clinical management and shielding the most vulnerable populations in the society. The pandemic is yet another reminder that we need to invest in public health, ramp up national capacities to detect a disease early and respond rapidly to emerging infections, strengthen and respect our national institutions and rely on evidence base for policymaking. It is high time that we paid heed to these lessons and strengthened without any further delay our health system capacity, as epidemics and pandemics of this nature will continue to challenge public health well into the future. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","COVID-19; health system response; pandemic; public health",,,"J.

The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult. Methods: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. Results: Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. Conclusions: The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; Mathematical model; Multi-source data; SEIR model","Article; basic reproduction number; China; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; infection control; isolation; mathematical model; quarantine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; patient isolation; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine","32171948","Int.

Methods: Sixty-three confirmed patients were enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. Results: CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 ± 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 ± 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 14 (22.2%) patients had GGO, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11 (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid nodules. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients progressed, including single GGO increased, enlarged and consolidated; fibrous stripe enlarged, while solid nodules increased and enlarged. Conclusions: Imaging changes in novel viral pneumonia are rapid. The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Imaging changes of typical viral pneumonia and some specific imaging features were observed. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately. Key Points: • High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is critical for early detection, evaluation of disease severity and follow-up of patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia. • The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse and change rapidly. • Radiologists should be aware of the various features of the disease and temporal changes. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronavirus infections; Lung diseases; Pneumonia, viral; Thorax; Tomography, x-ray computed","adult; Article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; female; follow up; human; lung lobe; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; hypertrophy; middle aged; pandemic; thorax; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Hypertrophy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Thorax; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32055945","Eur.

The reliance on antimicrobials such as antibiotics has become a major issue for both medicine and agriculture, particularly given the slow development of new medicines and pharmaceutical industry investment. The UK government has been working with other international bodies in the search for solutions to the many challenges AMR poses. Herbal medicines may provide a useful modality in the fight against AMR and can work solely or in tandem with current antimicrobial approaches. Recommendations for herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 viral pandemic have featured in Chinese national guidelines and policies, but UK strategies have no such guidance on herbal treatment for any infectious disease. More research is urgently needed to explore the biological plausibility and safety of herbal medicines to manage AMR. AMR is universal, affecting anyone and everyone, at any age and in any country. Investigating how such approaches can be integrated into western medicine will be important to elucidate. © 2020","Antibiotics; Antimicrobial resistance; Global health; Government response; Herbal medicine; Infection","antibiotic agent; agriculture; antibiotic resistance; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug utilization; environmental management; global health; government; herbal medicine; human; infection; intersectoral collaboration; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; public health; United Kingdom; western medicine",,"Eur.

The current study aimed to assess student knowledge about COVID-19 at different Jordanian universities and determine where they sourced their information. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,083 undergraduate or postgraduate students from different governmental and private universities during the initial stage of the disease in Jordan (March 19–21, 2020) using a validated, structured, self-administered, online questionnaire. The survey was structured to assess their knowledge about viral sources, incubation period, mortality rate, transmission, symptoms and complications as well as the source of information about COVID-19. Results:Overall, 56.5% of the respondents showed good knowledge and almost 40.5% showed moderate knowledge. On the other hand, 3.0% of the participants showed poor knowledge about COVID-19. The average knowledge score of students was 80.1%, which is considered to be within the scale of good knowledge. Both the college of study and educational level significantly (P < 0.05) associated with student knowledge. Students who majored in medical sciences showed the highest mean score of 82.8%, with 69.0% displaying a good knowledge level. Postgraduate students had significantly higher knowledge scores compared to undergraduate students. The majority of students used the internet, social media and mass media as sources of information about COVID-19. Scientific websites and articles were used more commonly by medical and postgraduate students. Conclusions:The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge to the health of the world population; therefore, these results assessing students' knowledge provide an important baseline for planning required educational interventions such as contact tracing and self-quarantine. These results may also help public health authorities by engaging communities in implementation of protective health measures, including positive hygienic practices such as hand washing to reduce the risk of COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Olaimat, Aolymat, Shahbaz and Holley.","awareness; coronavirus; COVID-19; information source; Jordan; knowledge; SARS-CoV-2 virus; university student",,,"Front.

After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents. METHODS We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded. Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later. Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic. RESULTS Twenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive. Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide. CONCLUSIONS Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection- control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility. © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.",,"nucleotide; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; fever; health care facility; health survey; human; intensive care; mortality rate; nasopharynx; nucleotide sequence; nursing care; oropharynx; prevalence; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; resident; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; virus culture; virus transmission; virus viability; asymptomatic disease; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; complication; Coronavirus infection; coughing; disease transmission; dyspnea; epidemiology; female; fever; genetics; infection control; isolation and purification; male; mortality; nursing home; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; very elderly; virus genome; virus load; virus pneumonia; Washington; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asymptomatic Diseases; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Dyspnea; Female; Fever; Genome, Viral; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Skilled Nursing Facilities; Viral Load; Washington","32329971","New Engl.

The progression of this viral infection occurs in the airways of the lungs with an exaggerated inflammatory response referred to as the “cytokine storm” that can lead to lethal lung injuries. In the absence of an effective anti-viral molecule and until the formulation of a successful vaccine, anti-inflammatory drugs might offer a complementary tool for controlling the associated complications of COVID-19 and thus decreasing the subsequent fatalities. Drug repurposing for several molecules has emerged as a rapid temporary solution for COVID-19. Among these drugs is Thalidomide; a historically emblematic controversial molecule that harbors an FDA approval for treating erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Based on just one-case report that presented positive outcomes in a patient treated amongst others with Thalidomide, two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of Thalidomide in treating severe respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients were registered. Yet, the absence of substantial evidence on Thalidomide usage in that context along with the discontinued studies on the efficiency of this drug in similar pulmonary diseases, might cause a significant obstacle for carrying out further clinical evaluations. Herein, we will discuss the theoretical effectiveness of Thalidomide in attenuating inflammatory complications that are encountered in COVID-19 patients while pinpointing the lack of the needed evidences to move forward with this drug. © Copyright © 2020 Khalil, Kamar and Nemer.","anti-inflammatory drug; COVID-19; cytokine storm; lung injury; thalidomide","antiinflammatory agent; methylprednisolone; thalidomide; antivirus agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; thalidomide; acute lung injury; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; drug repositioning; human; inflammation; lung disease; lung injury; lung toxicity; nonhuman; peripheral neuropathy; pneumonia; somnolence; thromboembolism; animal; complication; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; immunology; inflammation; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antiviral Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Inflammation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Thalidomide","32574274","Front.

The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues. © Copyright © 2020 Raony, de Figueiredo, Pandolfo, Giestal-de-Araujo, Oliveira-Silva Bomfim and Savino.","central nervous system; COVID-19; cytokine; HPA axis; mental health; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; social isolation","brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; corticotropin releasing factor; dopamine; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 18; interleukin 2 receptor; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; noradrenalin; serotonin; tocilizumab; Article; autophagy (cellular); bipolar disorder; cell interaction; cell invasion; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; depression; disease transmission; gene sequence; genetic analysis; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immune interaction; immune response; inflammation; long term potentiation; mental health; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nerve cell plasticity; neuroendocrine system; neuropathology; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological aspect; schizophrenia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation; systematic review; brain; Coronavirus infection; endocrine disease; immunology; mental disease; neuroendocrine system; neurologic disease; psychology; virology; virus pneumonia; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Endocrine System Diseases; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Nervous System Diseases; Neurosecretory Systems; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation","32574266","Front.

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical “droplet precaution” to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of “environmental droplet contamination” (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote “public droplet safety,” we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal “community droplet reduction solution” is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 “social distancing.” All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a “community droplet reduction solution” (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Rodriguez-Palacios, Cominelli, Basson, Pizarro and Ilic.","cloth masks; coronavirus; COVID-19; public droplet safety; respiratory pandemic; SARS-Cov-2; spray simulation model; textiles","polyester; aerosol; airborne bacterium; airborne virus; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dispersion; household; model; nonhuman; pandemic; respiratory tract infection; respiratory virus; safety; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulation; sneezing; speech; viral contamination",,"Front.

However, given persistent dyspnoea and labs suggestive of COVID-19 infection, the patient remained hospitalised for further monitoring. Forty-eight hours after initial testing, the PCR test was repeated and returned positive for COVID-19. This case illustrates the importance of clinical vigilance to retest patients for COVID-19, particularly in the absence of another compelling aetiology. As COVID-19 testing improves to rapidly generate results, selective retesting of patients may uncover additional COVID-19 cases and strengthen measures to minimise the spread of COVID-19. © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

While China - where the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known. Methods: To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Results: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. Conclusions: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Disease spreading; Metapopulation dynamics","age; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease eradication; disease transmission; early diagnosis; health care planning; incidence; infection control; infection sensitivity; isolation; mathematical analysis; mortality; public health service; simulation; Spain; stochastic model; symptom; World Health Organization","32456689","BMC Med.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085463982

Presently, emergency surgery for patients with suspected COVID-19 is burdensome not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. Therefore, we established a surveillance system in the emergency room and established principles for managing patients suspected of COVID-19 who require emergency surgery. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with appendicitis in March 2020. His wife was diagnosed with COVID-19 10 d earlier, and the patient was in close contact with her. The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient's lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease. CONCLUSION: When COVID-19 is suspected, emergency surgery should be performed as for confirmed COVID-19 without delay. © 2020 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Unprecedented hardship due to ongoing fears of exposure and threats to personal safety, along with societal measures enacted to curb disease transmission, have had broad psychosocial impact on patients and healthcare workers alike. These changes can significantly affect diagnosing and managing behavioral emergencies such as agitation in the emergency department. On behalf of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry, we highlight unique considerations for patients with severe behavioral symptoms and staff members managing symptoms of agitation during COVID-19.

Some patients also experience neurological signs and symptoms ranging from anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, and vomiting to confusion, encephalitis, and stroke. Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies. Most CA patients burdened by progressive neurologic deficits have substantially impaired mobility and other essential functions, for which they rely heavily on ambulatory services, including rehabilitation and psychosocial care. Cessation of these interventions because of isolation restrictions places the CA patient population at risk of further deterioration. This international panel of ataxia experts provides recommendations for neurologists caring for patients with CA, emphasizing a pro-active approach designed to maintain their autonomy and well-being: continue long-term medications, promote rehabilitation efforts, utilize the technology of virtual visits for regular contact with healthcare providers, and pay attention to emotional and psychosocial health. Neurologists should play an active role in decision-making in those CA cases requiring escalation to intensive care and resuscitation. Multi-disciplinary collaboration between care teams is always important, and never more so than in the context of the current pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Manto, Dupre, Hadjivassiliou, Louis, Mitoma, Molinari, Shaikh, Soong, Strupp, Van Overwalle and Schmahmann.","ataxia; cerebellum; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; therapies","adverse outcome; ageusia; ambulatory care; anosmia; Article; brain stem; breathing mechanics; cerebellar ataxia; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; confusion; coronavirus disease 2019; emotionality; encephalitis; epidemic; headache; health care personnel; human; immunosuppressive treatment; intensive care; medical care; medical decision making; medical expert; medical technology; mental health; nausea; nerve cell lesion; neurologic disease; neurological complication; neurologist; nonhuman; nose cavity; olfactory nerve; pandemic; patient care; practice guideline; psychosocial care; regulatory mechanism; rehabilitation care; resuscitation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; telemedicine; virtual reality; vomiting; walking difficulty; wellbeing",,"Front.

METHODS We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.

METHODS After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. RESULTS As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County. CONCLUSIONS In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.

Elucidating why some patients suffering from COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe. The answer to this question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic. Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on unraveling of interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role. An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined. More importantly, a comprehensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality. Herewith, the authors present a combined viewpoint based on the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.

So far, however, limited data are available for children. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children. Methods: From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected. The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated. Results: Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side. Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type. Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes. One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins. Conclusions: The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various.

In this uncontrolled, exploratory study, 77 adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were treated with either nebulized IFN-α2b (5 mU b.i.d.), arbidol (200 mg t.i.d.) or a combination of IFN-α2b plus arbidol. Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing along with hematological measurements, including cell counts, blood biochemistry and serum cytokine levels, and temperature and blood oxygen saturation levels, were recorded for each patient during their hospital stay. Treatment with IFN-α2b with or without arbidol significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and in parallel reduced duration of elevated blood levels for the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP. These findings suggest that IFN-α2b should be further investigated as a therapy in COVID-19 cases. © Copyright © 2020 Zhou, Chen, Shannon, Wei, Xiang, Wang, Wang, Tebbutt, Kollmann and Fish.","ARDS; COVID-19; IL-6; inflammation; interferon; viral shedding","arbidol; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; recombinant alpha2b interferon; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; arbidol; biological marker; cytokine; indole derivative; Interferon-alpha2b; adult; age; aged; Article; cell count; cell population; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease severity; female; flow cytometry; gender; human; major clinical study; male; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; treatment outcome; viral clearance; virus load; blood; China; clinical trial; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; Coronavirus infection; immunology; middle aged; pandemic; sex factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; China; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Indoles; Interferon-alpha; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sex Factors","32574262","Front.

The aim of the present study was to help clinicians gain a better understanding about differences between Influenza virus pneumonia and COVID-19 by comparative analysis of the early-stage clinical features. Methods: Clinical data of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and influenza A pneumonia identified in our hospital were collected and analyzed retrospectively to identify the clinical features that could differentiate between the two types of viral pneumonia. Results: The two types of viral pneumonia mainly affected adults, especially people over 50 years, with no gender difference between them. Fever, cough, sputum and muscle soreness were the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Some patients with COVID-19 may also exhibit digestive tract symptoms. Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) was a more common phenomenon in patients with COVID-19 than that in patients with influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia. In addition, eosinophil count was decreased and the monocyte percentage was increased in COVID-19 patients. The grid-form shadow was a typical presentation of COVID-19 on the lung CT image, and the disease usually progressed quickly within a week. Conclusion: Influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 are two different types of respiratory viral pneumonia with very similar clinical manifestations. The percentage of monocytes is increased and the eosinophil count is decreased in COVID-19. Glass-ground density exudation shadow located peripherally is the typical sign of COVID-19 on the lung CT image, and the shadow often with grid-form sign. These features may not be typically observed in patients with influenza pneumonia. Chest CT scan combined with nucleic acid detection is an effective and accurate method for diagnosing COVID-19. Blood routine test has a limited diagnostic value in differentiating the two forms of pneumonia. © Copyright © 2020 Shen, Tan, Song, Zhang, Liang, Yu and Wang.","Clinical features; coronavirus disease 2019; early stage; grid-form shadow; Influenza A; Pneumonia",,,"Front.

As a buffer zone to the capital city, there is urgent attention on the preparedness of the cities and regencies in East Kalimantan to respond to emergent infectious disease events such as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). AIM: The aim of the present study was to descriptively convey information about COVID-19 cases in East Kalimantan during the period of March 18, 2020–April 18, 2020, in terms of the isolation, testing, and tracing mechanisms used. METHODS: The initial distribution of COVID-19 was identified in 5 of 10 districts and is now present in almost all districts except for one very remote regency. RESULTS: The tracing performance of the fast response teams in East Kalimantan during this period was considered satisfactory with a mean of 0.7% of people under observation testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and a mean of 14.4% patients under investigations testing positive. The use of rapid tests since March 30, 2020 has improved the detection ability, with confirmed positive cases as a percentage of confirmed negatives increasing from 20.2% to 31.8%. The use of the COVID-19 rapid test was cross-checked with a dengue rapid test to prevent false-positive identification. Confirmed clusters were announced to the public, urging people to respond and report. CONCLUSION: The 1-month progress of COVID-19 cases in East Kalimantan showed a total case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.85%, a closed CFR of 8.3% and a closed case recovery rate of 91.7%. © 2020 Swandari Paramita, Anton Rahmadi, Ronny Isnuwardana, Rudy Agung Nugroho Ronny Isnuwardana, Rudy Agung Nugroho.","Case fatality rate; Cluster identification; Coronavirus disease-19; East Kalimantan; Tracing",,,"Open Access Maced.

Design Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. Setting 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. Participants 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). Interventions Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). Main outcome measure Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. Results Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%). The difference between groups was 4.1% (95% confidence interval -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. Conclusions Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients. Trial registration ChiCTR2000029868. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

However, detailed information on the characteristics of COVID-19 in children is still scarce. Five patients with non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation were hospitalized from the emergency department, and were later confirmed to have COVID-19, between 23 January and 20 February 2020, at the Wuhan Children's Hospital. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was positive for all the patients. Four of the patients were male and one was female, and their ages ranged from 2-months to 5.6 years. All lived in Wuhan. One patient had a clear history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, one had a suspected history of exposure, while the others had no exposure history. For three of the five patients, the primary onset disease required an emergency operation or treatment, and included intussusception, acute suppurative appendicitis perforation with local peritonitis, and traumatic subdural hemorrhage with convulsion, while for the other two it was acute gastroenteritis (including one patient with hydronephrosis and a stone in his left kidney). During the course of the disease, four of the five patients had a fever, whereas one case had no fever or cough. Two patients had leukopenia, and one also had lymphopenia. In the two cases of severe COVID-19, the levels of CRP, PCT, serum ferritin, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased, whereas the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and CD16 + CD56 natural killer cells were decreased. We also found impaired liver, kidney, and myocardial functions; the presence of hypoproteinemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia; and, in one case, abnormal coagulation function. Except for one patient who had a rotavirus infection, all patients tested negative for common pathogens, including the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella. Chest CT images of all the patients showed patches or ground-glass opacities in the lung periphery or near the pleura, even large consolidations.

In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT <22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques. © Copyright © 2020 Mertens, De Vos, Martiny, Jassoy, Mirazimi, Cuypers, Van den Wijngaert, Monteil, Melin, Stoffels, Yin, Mileto, Delaunoy, Magein, Lagrou, Bouzet, Serrano, Wautier, Leclipteux, Van Ranst, Vandenberg and LHUB-ULB SARS-CoV-2 working diagnostic group.","antigen; COVID-19; diagnostic; immunochromatographic test; SARS-CoV-2","colloidal gold; gold nanoparticle; monoclonal antibody; virus nucleoprotein; Article; clinical laboratory; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; diagnostic accuracy; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; membrane technology; pandemic; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reference value; reproducibility; retrospective study; risk management; SARS coronavirus; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture",,"Front.

The BCG vaccine has been extensively used to protect against tuberculosis for almost a 100 years. Interestingly, this vaccine reduces children's mortality caused by infections unrelated to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a phenomenon thought to be due to the induction of trained immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected, as of April 22, 2020, 2,623,231 people globally, causing a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, no vaccine or treatment is available to control this pandemic. We analyzed the number of positive cases and deaths in different countries and correlated them with the inclusion of BCG vaccination at birth in their national vaccination programs.

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-Xray) was trained on 24,678 CXR images including 1,540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired CXR images (n=454) obtained in patients suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4th and April 6th 2020 in a single center (223 RT-PCR positive subjects, 231 RT-PCR negative subjects). The radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was performed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results For the test set, the mean age of the patients was 67.3 (+/-14.4) years (56% male). Using RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified CXR images as COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.81. The system significantly outperforms each reader (p < 0.001 using McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader can significantly outperform the AI system (p=0.04). Conclusions An AI system for detection of COVID-19 on chest radiographs was comparable to six independent readers.",,,"32384019","Radiology",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084617461

As of April 22, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take its toll, with >2.6 million confirmed infections and >183,000 deaths. Dire projections are surfacing almost every day, and policymakers worldwide are using projections for critical decisions. Given this background, we modeled unobserved infections to examine the extent to which we might be grossly underestimating COVID-19 infections in North America. METHODS: We developed a machine-learning model to uncover hidden patterns based on reported cases and to predict potential infections. First, our model relied on dimensionality reduction to identify parameters that were key to uncovering hidden patterns. Next, our predictive analysis used an unbiased hierarchical Bayesian estimator approach to infer past infections from current fatalities. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that, when we assumed a 13-day lag time from infection to death, the United States, as of April 22, 2020, likely had at least 1.3 million undetected infections. With a longer lag time-for example, 23 days-there could have been at least 1.7 million undetected infections. Given these assumptions, the number of undetected infections in Canada could have ranged from 60,000 to 80,000. Duarte's elegant unbiased estimator approach suggested that, as of April 22, 2020, the United States had up to >1.6 million undetected infections and Canada had at least 60,000 to 86,000 undetected infections. However, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data feed on April 22, 2020, reported only 840,476 and 41,650 confirmed cases for the United States and Canada, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 2 key findings: (1) as of April 22, 2020, the United States may have had 1.5 to 2.029 times the number of reported infections and Canada may have had 1.44 to 2.06 times the number of reported infections and (2) even if we assume that the fatality and growth rates in the unobservable population (undetected infections) are similar to those in the observable population (confirmed infections), the number of undetected infections may be within ranges similar to those described above. In summary, 2 different approaches indicated similar ranges of undetected infections in North America. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level V.

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.",,"virus RNA; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; genetics; human; laboratory technique; male; middle aged; pandemic; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Viral","32118639","Chin.

Therefore, it is time to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The current population-based study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of people in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were randomly recruited and asked to complete a structured questionnaire, including the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the global rating of change scale and items related to COVID-19. Of the 500 respondents included in the study, 19% had depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) and 14% had anxiety (GAD score ≥ 10). In addition, 25.4% reported that their mental health had deteriorated since the pandemic. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that not experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, being worried about being infected by COVID-19, being bothered by having not enough surgical masks and being bothered by not being able to work from home were associated with a poorer mental health status. Psychological support, such as brief, home-based psychological interventions, should be provided to citizens during the pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, χ = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, χ = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein.

The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) as an infectious disease showed that it has undesirable social, environmental, and economic impacts, and leads to serious challenges and threats. Additionally, investigating the prioritization parameters is of vital importance to reducing the negative impacts of this global crisis. Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters—such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed—and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset. In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters. The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE. In addition, the priority of two variables, urban parameter, and relative humidity, were the highest to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

As yet there are no reports on duration and recovery rates. We set out to characterise patients reporting new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic and report on early recovery rates. Methods: Online Survey of patients reporting self-diagnosed new onset smell and taste disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1 week follow-up. Results: Three hundred eighty-two patents completed bot an initial and follow-up survey. 86.4% reported complete anosmia and a further 11.5% a very severe loss of smell at the time of completing the first survey. At follow-up 1 week later, there is already significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss. 80.1% report lower severity scores at follow-up, 17.6% are unchanged and 1.9% are worse. 11.5% already report compete resolution at follow up, while 17.3% report persistent complete loss of smell, with reported duration being 1 to over 4 weeks. This is reflected in the overall cumulative improvement rate of 79% patients overall in the interval between surveys. Conclusions: A review of the growing evidence base supports the likelihood that out cohort have suffered olfactory loss as part of COVID-19 infection. While early recovery rates are encouraging, long term rates will need to be further investigated and there may be an increase in patients with persistent post-viral loss as a result of the pandemic. We further call for loss of sense of smell to be formerly recognised as a marker of COVID-19 infection. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anosmia; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Olfactory dysfunction","omega 3 fatty acid; retinol; steroid; thioctic acid; adult; anosmia; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; dysgeusia; female; follow up; human; hypogeusia; major clinical study; male; metallic taste; observational study; pandemic; priority journal; self concept; self evaluation; smelling disorder; supplementation; taste disorder; adolescent; aged; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; middle aged; odor; pandemic; questionnaire; smelling disorder; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Smell; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","32366299","J.

As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide. The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness. Areas covered: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19. Expert opinion: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19. Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation. The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; immune-epidemiology; Novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV2","cytokine; epitope; interferon; protein S; adaptive immunity; aged; Article; Betacoronavirus; cause of death; cell population; cold; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; down regulation; dying; environmental temperature; epidemiological data; host pathogen interaction; human; humidity; immune response; immune system; immunogenetics; infection risk; infectious agent; innate immunity; male; microparasite; molecular phylogeny; pandemic; pathogenicity; population; protein motif; receptor binding; respiratory system; respiratory tract infection; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; virus immunity; virus virulence; China; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; immunology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32237901","Expert Rev.

It informs on both undiagnosed cases and on the effects of health system disruption. Methods: We aimed at evaluating the extent of the total death excess during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Data from 4433 municipalities providing mortality reports until April 15th, 2020 were included for a total of 34.5 million residents from all Italian regions. Data were analyzed by region, sex and age, and compared to expected from 2015–2019. Results: In both genders, overall mortality was stable until February 2020 and abruptly increased from March 1st onwards. Within the municipalities studied, 77,339 deaths were observed in the period between March 1st to April 15th, 2020, in contrast to the 50,822.6 expected. The rate ratio was 1.11 before age 60 and 1.55 afterwards. Both sexes were affected. The excess was greater in the regions most affected by COVID-19 but always exceeded the deaths attributed to COVID-19. The extrapolation to the total Italian population suggests an excess of 45,033 deaths in the study period, while the number of COVID–19 deaths was 21,046. Conclusion: Our paper shows a large death excess during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy; greater than the number attributed to it. Possible causes included both the undetected cases and the disruption of the Health Service organization. Timely monitoring of overall mortality based on unbiased nationwide data is an essential tool for epidemic control. © 2020 by the authors.

In addition to the medical practice for treatment and immunization, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of community spread phenomena as related research reports 17.9–30.8% confirmed cases to remain asymptomatic. Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time. This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics. To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time. Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city. © 2020 by the authors.

Such loss could be prevented if there is a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHODS: Using CHO cell expressed full length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreaks or during the outbreak, and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULTS: The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day one after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during the hospitalization and after been discharged for two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 out of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and one out of five nucleic acid test-negative ""Close contacts"" of COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSION: With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, in-coming patients, passengers and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders"", protect the medical staff and stop the further spreading of the virus. © The Author(s) 2020.

On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate.

Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spikemediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafetylevel- 3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here, we detailed how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also made all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrated how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles could be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Methods: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. Results: All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 × 109 cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 × 109 cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus. Conclusions: Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them. © 2020","COVID-19; CT scan; Laboratory medicine; SARS-CoV-2","alanine aminotransferase; antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; corticosteroid; aminotransferase; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; anamnesis; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; China; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; environmental exposure; fatigue; female; fever; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; laboratory test; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; male; medical record review; neutrophilia; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; symptom; throat culture; university hospital; virus pneumonia; virus reactivation; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; isolation and purification; pandemic; pathology; pharynx; recurrent disease; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Transaminases","32171867","J.

Methods: Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Results: During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive. Conclusions: Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture.

In line with the One-Health concept, extending the target of the studies to the animals which humans are continuously interacting with may favor a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenetic mechanisms; thus, helping to adopt the most suitable containment measures. The last two decades have already faced severe manifestations of the coronavirus infection in both humans and animals, thus, circulating epitopes from previous outbreaks might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the present study, we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes and compare them with the homologues of taxonomically-related coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world. Protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated proteins. Moreover, structural epitope mapping by homology modelling revealed a potential immunogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins.

Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 vírus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection. © 2020 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients between February 6 and February 14, 2020 with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on pharyngeal swab specimens using real time RT-PCR. 194 (81.5%) of the serums were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibodies between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85), whose nucleic acid tests were negative. The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped from below 50% to over 80%. However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. Overall, the suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After the 11th day post-disease onset, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. © 2020 Institut Pasteur","Diagnosis; Nucleic acid test; SARS-CoV-2; Serological assay","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; virus RNA; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; hospital patient; human; male; middle aged; pandemic; serology; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Serologic Tests","32425648","Microbes Infect.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084806177

Methods: IgM and IgG antibody levels were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay in 338 COVID-19 patients. Results: IgM levels increased during the first week after SARS-CoV-2 infection, peaked 2 weeks and then reduced to near-background levels in most patients. IgG was detectable after 1 week and was maintained at a high level for a long period. The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG antibody detections were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical disease groups. Severe and critical cases had higher IgM levels than mild cases, whereas the IgG level in critical cases was lower than those in both mild and severe cases. This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases. The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ. A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course.

Methods: This study retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was eventually excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgG-positive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant. Conclusions: Viral serological testing is an effective means of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The positive rate and titer variance of IgG are higher than those of IgM in COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Diagnosis; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; SARS-CoV-2; Serological test","guanine nucleotide binding protein; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; vitronectin; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; adult; antibody titer; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; clinical article; clinical feature; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic value; female; human; immunoglobulin blood level; laboratory; male; medical record review; middle aged; molecular diagnosis; predictive value; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; serology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Serologic Tests","32251798","Int.

The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis in 5630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates. RESULTS: The overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1952/5630). Male (P = 0.025) and older populations (P = 2.525 × 10-39) were at significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30-79 years. Furthermore, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the amount of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 35.5%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847 × 10-9) and a 1.43-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 39.9%) from testing once to 3 times (P= 7.797 × 10-14). More than 3 testing administrations was not helpful for further improvement. However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P= 0.097). CONCLUSION: All populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk. Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia. It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible. © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",,"adult; aged; article; China; controlled study; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; adolescent; age; child; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; incidence; infant; laboratory technique; middle aged; molecular diagnosis; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; virus RNA; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; RNA, Viral; Sex Factors; Young Adult","32352933","JCI Insight",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085266065

We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses.

Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential. Methods: We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Results: Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa = 0.308).

The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) and the respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. We reviewed the international literature regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak. Here below, we focus mainly on the diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis. We detail the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19. We also focus on the proper method of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also cite the current national epidemiologic regulations of testing for novel coronavirus. In the last section, we emphasize the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and healthcare burden even in Hungary. In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality. The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care. It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries. © Szerző(k)","COVID-19; Diagnostic testing; High-risk patient; Novel coronavirus; Outbreak; Pandemic; Prognosis; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease burden; epidemic; gold standard; health service; high risk patient; human; intensive care; microbiological examination; mortality rate; pandemic; point of care testing; prognosis; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"Orvosi Hetil.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084376802

Estimating an R0 of COVID-19 at around 3 justified postponing non-urgent face-to-face consultations and expanding the use of teleconsultation in order to limit the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health workers and comply with the lockdown. The health authority recommends cancellation of all medical or surgical activities, which are not urgent as long as this does not involve a loss of chance for the patient. The purpose of this cancellation is to significantly increase critical care capacity, prioritise the reception of patients with COVID-19, prioritise the allocation of staff and provision of the equipment necessary for their medical or surgical management, and contribute to the smooth running of downstream critical care within their establishment. Another goal is to reduce the risks of patient contamination within healthcare facilities. This document provides guidance on how to proceed with and adapt ENT surgery in the current pandemic context, as well as on the management of postponed operations.

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. Methods: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. Findings: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0·15, 95% CI −0·19 to −0·11; R2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. Interpretation: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. Methods: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Results: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild. Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing. © 2020","Children; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","Article; child; clinical feature; clinical study; comparative study; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease severity; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; household; human; intensive care; lymphocytopenia; meta analysis; mother; newborn; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diagnostic imaging; fever; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; lung; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Child; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Fever; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32307322","J.

Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia. Methods: For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group. Conclusions: This is the first report of surveillance of COVID-19 in Bolivia, with patients managed mainly with home isolation.

Coronaviridae comprises a large family, of which at least seven members are known to cause respiratory diseases in humans. Coronaviruses have the ability to infect virtually all major groups of animals and, eventually, can infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cross the species barrier and infect humans. This virus was identified in an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. Its entire genome is inscribed on a single strand of ribonucleic acid. Some proteins present on the surface of the virus act as facilitators for its entry into host cells, while others, apparently, are related to its pathogenesis. Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals. The infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses can activate an excessive and unregulated immune response, which may promote SARS development.

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a severe outbreak throughout the world. The host immunity of COVID-19 patients is unknown. METHODS. The routine laboratory tests and host immunity in COVID-19 patients with different severity of illness were compared after patient admission. RESULTS. A total of 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were classified as having mild (n = 30), severe (n = 20), and extremely severe (n = 15) illness. Many routine laboratory tests, such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer, were increased in severe and extremely severe patients. The absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells were gradually decreased with increased severity of illness. The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The costimulatory molecule CD28 had opposite results. The percentage of natural Tregs was decreased in extremely severe patients. The percentage of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells was increased in both severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients. The percentage of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells was increased in extremely severe patients. IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10 were all increased in extremely severe patients. The activation of DC and B cells was decreased in extremely severe patients. CONCLUSION. The number and function of T cells are inconsistent in COVID-19 patients. The hyperfunction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is associated with the pathogenesis of extremely severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",,"CD28 antigen; CD45RO antigen; D dimer; ferritin; gamma interferon; HLA DR antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 2 receptor; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; cytokine; adult; Article; B cell count; B lymphocyte activation; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD8 lymphocyte count; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dendritic cell; disease severity; female; human; interferon production; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; natural killer cell count; regulatory T lymphocyte; Betacoronavirus; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic test; immunity; immunology; metabolism; middle aged; pandemic; pathophysiology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severity of illness index; T lymphocyte; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Immunity; Lymphocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; T-Lymphocytes","32324595","JCI Insight",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084617630

The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. Objective: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. Methods: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. Results: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ""Coronavirus"" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). Conclusions: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes. © 2020 Han Woo Park, Sejung Park, Miyoung Chong.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infectious disease; Infodemiology; Medical news; Outbreak; Pandemic; Public health; SARS-CoV-2; Social media; South Korea; Twitter","Article; behavior disorder; conflict; content analysis; conversation; coronavirus disease 2019; human; information dissemination; interpersonal communication; medical information; pandemic; public figure; public health campaign; public policy; social behavior; social media; social network; South Korea; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; health education; interpersonal communication; mass medium; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social media; South Korea; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Health Education; Humans; Mass Media; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Republic of Korea; Social Media","32325426","J.

One previous study reported a family cluster with an asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers. Methods: A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also verified them with the patients and their families. Results: Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not traveled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days two through three of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs. Case 4 presented with diarrhea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities. Case 2 presented no clinical nor radiographic abnormalities. All five cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein.

Results: In children, incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 (1–5%) is low and of good prognosis. The indications for nasal flexible endoscopy should be drastically limited. If undertaken, full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks are required, as well as use of a sheath. Saline nose wash done by caregivers other than parents at home should require PPE. Unless foreign body tracheobronchial aspiration is clinically obvious, CT-scan should be performed to confirm indication of endoscopy. Surgical indications should be limited to emergencies and to cases that cannot be delayed beyond 2 months (especially endonasal, endopharyngeal laryngo-tracheobronchial procedures). Postponement should ideally be a group decision and recorded as such in the medical file. Surgical techniques should be adapted to limit the risk of viral dissemination in the air, avoiding the use of drills, microdebriders, monopolar cautery or lasers. Continuous suction should be placed near the operating field.

Methods: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. Results: Keywords such as ""novel coronavirus,"" ""China coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""2019-nCOV,"" and ""SARS-COV-2"" were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy. The top five searches related to health were ""face masks,"" ""amuchina"" (disinfectant), ""symptoms of the novel coronavirus,"" ""health bulletin,"" and ""vaccines for coronavirus."" The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total >140). Misinformation was widely circulated in the Campania region, and racism-related information was widespread in Umbria and Basilicata. These monikers were frequently searched (APC weighted total >100) in more than 10 major cities in Italy, including Rome. Conclusions: We identified a growing regional and population-level interest in COVID-19 in Italy. The majority of searches were related to amuchina, face masks, health bulletins, and COVID-19 symptoms. Since a large number of infodemic monikers were observed across Italy, we recommend that health agencies use Google Trends to predict human behavior as well as to manage misinformation circulation in Italy. © 2020 Alessandro Rovetta, Akshaya Srikanth Bhagavathula.","Behavior; Communication; COVID-19; Digital health; Google search; Google Trends; Infodemic monikers; Infodemiology; Italy; Novel coronavirus; Online search; Public health","disinfectant agent; Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; health behavior; human; information seeking; Internet; Italy; medical information; misinformation; publication; racism; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"J.

Recent reports suggest an association with use of renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for coronaviruses. Higher ACE2 concentrations might lead to increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 in patients on RAAS inhibitors. Methods and results We measured ACE2 concentrations in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure (index cohort). Results were validated in 1123 men and 575 women (validation cohort). The median age was 69 years for men and 75 years for women. The strongest predictor of elevated concentrations of ACE2 in both cohorts was male sex (estimate = 0.26, P < 0.001; and 0.19, P < 0.001, respectively). In the index cohort, use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was not an independent predictor of plasma ACE2. In the validation cohort, ACE inhibitor (estimate = - 0.17, P = 0.002) and ARB use (estimate = -0.15, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2, while use of an MRA (estimate = 0.11, P = 0.04) was an independent predictor of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. Conclusion In two independent cohorts of patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of ACE2 were higher in men than in women, but use of neither an ACE inhibitor nor an ARB was associated with higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. These data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of COVID-19 in men, but do not support previous reports suggesting that ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the vulnerability for COVID-19 through increased plasma ACE2 concentrations. © The Author(s) 2020.","ACE2; Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Heart failure; Men","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; mineralocorticoid antagonist; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; coronavirus disease 2019; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug use; enzyme blood level; female; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rate; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; New York Heart Association class; priority journal; protein processing; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; Europe; heart failure; middle aged; pandemic; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; sex factor; virus pneumonia; Aged; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Europe; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Renin-Angiotensin System; Sex Factors","32388565","Eur.

Although knowledge of the nature of the disease is dynamic, with dozens of scientific articles being published every day about new features of COVID-19, the typical presentation is that of interstitial pneumonia. Despite the large amount of information that has been developed in recent weeks, it has been estimated that this disease can have up to 72% underdiagnosis, which requires clinical tools that are simple, easily accessible, and increase the detection of cases in a feasible way and that yield information with prognostic value. Given this need, some proposals have emerged to be able to diagnose, monitor and respond to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, such as pulmonary ultrasound (USP). It is worth mentioning that the USP has proven to be an efficient and easily reproducible technique for diagnosing heart failure and pleuro-pulmonary pathologies, especially in critically ill patients. Evidence of the usefulness of USP in COVID-19 is still scarce, although preliminary, it seems to be a sensitive technique whose findings have a high gold standard. In this brief review we will emphasize its technical aspects, the advantages and disadvantages, and finally a proposal for the approach in this type of patient. © 2020 Instituto Nacional de Cardiología Ignacio Chávez.","COVID-19; Interstitial pneumonia","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; echography; human; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; critical illness; diagnostic imaging; echography; interstitial lung disease; laboratory technique; pandemic; procedures; reproducibility; virology; virus pneumonia; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Humans; Lung Diseases, Interstitial; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Ultrasonography","32523142","Arch.

It has had unprecedented effect on healthcare systems globally with severe impact on every specialist service within the hospital including urology. While it affects the respiratory system causing symptoms ranging from fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, myalgia and fatigue, it eventually causes pneumonia and respiratory distress needing oxygenation and ventilation. Laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiological changes are seen on chest XR or CT scan of patients. The surge in patients affected by the disease has led to extreme pressures on healthcare systems by the overwhelming number of critically unwell patients. This scenario has presented challenges to maintain other emergency and essential services. Reallocation of staff, wards and equipment has resulted in cancellations of many surgical procedures, requiring urologists to select only the most essential or critical procedures. The outpatient face-to-face clinics are also cancelled or changed to telephone or video consultations. In some hospitals, urologists are required to work outside of their usual scope of practice helping their respiratory and intensive care unit colleagues. The pandemic is disrupting training and education opportunities for junior medical staff. In this review we provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the influence it has on urological practice and consider the long-term implications that may be of consequence for years to come. © 2020 by Turkish Association of Urology.","Anaesthesia; Corona virus; COVID-19; Endourology; Laparoscopy; Training; Urology; ventilation",,,"Turk.

The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is one of the coronaviruses. Realizing the severity of outcomes associated with this disease and its high rate of transmission, dentists were instructed by regulatory authorities, such as the American Dental Association, to stop providing treatment to dental patients except those who have emergency complaints. This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment. Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared.

If various issues directly related to health security risks could have been predicted accurately, public health and medical contingency plans might have been prepared and activated in advance of an epidemic such as COVID-19. This paper evaluates an important source of health security, the Global Health Security Index (2019), which provided data before the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate how countries might have been prepared for a global epidemic, or pandemic, and acted accordingly in an effective and timely manner. The GHS index numerical scores are calculated as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of six categories, where AM uses equal weights for each category. The GHS Index scores are regressed on the numerical score rankings of the six categories to check if the use of equal weights of 0.167 in the calculation of the GHS Index using AM is justified, with GM and HM providing a check of the robustness of the arithmetic mean. The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244–0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186–0.187 for AM. The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings. Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects. The quantitative and qualitative results are different when GM and HM are used. © 2020 by the authors.

Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: The situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. © 2020 Yuxin Zhao, Sixiang Cheng, Xiaoyan Yu, Huilan Xu.","China; COVID-19; Infodemic; Public attention; Public health emergency; Sina Microblog; Social media","Article; China; cluster analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; emotion; epidemic; human; online social network; public opinion; social media; attention; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; health education; pandemic; procedures; public health; public opinion; social media; virus pneumonia; Attention; China; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Health Education; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Public Opinion; Social Media","32314976","J.

This poses a challenge for early detection during triage in the emergency department (ED). Over a 3-month period, our ED aimed to minimize nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs). Methods: All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3-month period were tested for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID-19 were assessed. A risk-stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high-risk “fever areas” and lower-risk zones. When a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. Results: A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period. Among these, 70 cases of COVID-19 were subsequently confirmed. The majority (84.2%, 59/70) were detected at ED triage because they fulfilled suspect case criteria. Of these, 34 met the official screening criteria; an additional 25 were detected by the broader internal screening criteria. Over the 12-week period, the cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria was 84.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.6% to 91.9%), whereas the sensitivity of the official screening criteria was 48.6% (95% CI = 36.4% to 60.8%). Given the broadened internal criteria, the preexisting ED “fever area” was insufficient and had to be expanded. However, there were no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra-ED exposure, despite extensive surveillance. Conclusion: Frontline physicians need to be given leeway to decide on the disposition of cases based on clinical suspicion during an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. If a broader criterion is used at ED triage, ED facilities and isolation facilities need to be readied to accommodate a surge of suspect cases. Usage of appropriate PPE is essential in minimizing nosocomial transmission. © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",,"Article; case finding; contact isolation; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency health service; emergency ward; epidemic; health care personnel; hospital admission; human; infection control; isolation facility; major clinical study; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; safety procedure; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; Singapore; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; emergency health service; epidemic; female; fever; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; male; mass screening; pandemic; patient isolation; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; workflow; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Fever; Health Personnel; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Singapore; Triage; Workflow","32281231","Acad.

The proposed workflow accounts for the many aspects of dental practitioners’ risk in the COVID-19 era, and focuses on the assessment of patient risk level, a two-phase dental procedure management (remote and face-to-face), and the use of specific preventive measures. No cases of COVID-19 infection were detected among patients and staff of the dental unit in a two-month period of time while using this protocol. This workflow seems a promising and effective solution to manage dental procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak, and could be implemented in both public and private practices until the emergency is contained. © 2020 by the authors.

When our society has faced existential crises in the past, we have banded together by using the technology at hand to overcome them. The COVID-19 pandemic is one such threat that requires not only a cohesive effort, but also enormous trust to follow public health guidelines, maintain social distance, and share necessities. However, are democratic societies with civil liberties capable of doing this? Mobile technology has immense potential for addressing pandemics like COVID-19, as it gives us access to big data in terms of volume, velocity, veracity, and variety. These data are particularly relevant to understand and mitigate the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. In order for such intensive and potentially intrusive data collection measures to succeed, we need a cohesive societal effort with full buy-in from citizens and their representatives.

In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020. Results: In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In ± cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. Discussion: We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. Methods: Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. Results: The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period. Conclusions: We are still at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and scientific evidence is still scarce and incomplete, so these ABORL-CCF recommendations for otorhinolaryngologists may be updated based on new knowledge and the pattern of the new coronavirus spread. © 2020","Coronaviruses; ENT disease; Otolaryngologist","Article; consultation; coronavirus disease 2019; ear disease; emergency care; emergency ward; endoscopy; ENT examination; government; human; infection prevention; medical decision making; medical society; nonhuman; nose disease; otorhinolaryngology; paranasal sinus disease; patient care; pediatrics; practice guideline; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; telemedicine; tracheostomy; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; clinical practice; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; practice guideline; prevention and control; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Otolaryngology; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Societies, Medical","32371055","Brazilian J.

Methods: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, who were examined by both CT and rRT-PCR at initial presentation. The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated. Results: A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT. Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed. Amongst these 6 patients, 3 became positive in the second rRT-PCR assay(after 2 days, 2 days and 3 days respectively), and the other 3 became positive only in the third round of rRT-PCR tests(after 5 days, 6 days and 8 days respectively). At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%. Conclusion: rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; Pneumonia; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Tomography; X-Ray Computed","adult; Article; China; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic error; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; false negative result; female; human; intermethod comparison; laboratory test; male; pneumonia; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity analysis; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; laboratory technique; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32229322","Eur.

We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported. Methods: Clinical and CT data of 59 patients with COVID-19 from January 27 to February 14, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, including 14 laboratory-confirmed non-pregnant adults, 16 laboratory-confirmed and 25 clinically-diagnosed pregnant women, and 4 laboratory-confirmed children. The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. Findings: Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed (n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P = 0·007, P < 0·001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P = 0·001, P < 0·001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6–9 days after initial CT scans. Interpretation: Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation. The exposure history and clinical symptoms were more helpful for screening in children versus chest CT. © 2020","Children; COVID-19 pneumonia; CT; Pregnancy","adult; Article; body temperature measurement; child; clinical feature; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; disease severity assessment; early diagnosis; female; human; human cell; image analysis; image processing; leukocytosis; lung congestion; major clinical study; male; neutrophil count; nonhuman; pediatrics; pregnant woman; radiological parameters; retrospective study; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; China; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; infant; lung; pandemic; pathology; pneumonia; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; preschool child; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Lung; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","32171865","J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p&lt;0.05), with r-values of −0.446 and −0.780, respectively. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection. © 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists",,"C reactive protein; nucleic acid; adult; aged; Article; blood oxygen tension; body temperature; cardiovascular disease; case report; chest infection; chest tightness; China; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease exacerbation; disease severity; dyspnea; endocrine disease; epidemiological data; female; fever; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; human; hypertension; hypothyroidism; lung lesion; lung lobe; lung parenchyma; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; morphology; neurologic disease; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sore throat; spiral computer assisted tomography; sputum; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; lung; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, Spiral Computed; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","32216961","Clin.

Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Methods: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. Findings: From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7·1 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·8–10·9) from version 1 to 2, 2·8 times (1·9–4·2) from version 2 to 4, and 4·2 times (2·6–7·3) from version 4 to 5. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000–359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported. Interpretation: The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases. These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

We must minimize face-to-face contact with vulnerable populations. But we must also persist, adapt, and help our older patients and study participants during the pandemic. METHODS: Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. RESULTS: Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools such as e-mailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their healthcare needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely and reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS: We have an opportunity to make an impact on our older adult patients now as this pandemic continues to unfold. Above all, clinical researchers need to continue working, to help as many people as possible through the crisis.

Methods: The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia. Results: Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or manifested mild changes of lung infection. All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening. In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively. An extensive ""white lung"", with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients (3, 4%). On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities. Conclusions: Different CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratification. © 2020 The Author(s)","Computer tomography; Coronavirus disease-2019; Diagnosis; Pneumonia; X-ray","antivirus agent; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; atelectasis; child; clinical assessment; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease severity; female; follow up; human; image analysis; image display; lung infection; major clinical study; male; multidetector computed tomography; pleura effusion; practice guideline; priority journal; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; atelectasis; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; middle aged; pandemic; pleura effusion; preschool child; severity of illness index; very elderly; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pleural Effusion; Pneumonia, Viral; Pulmonary Atelectasis; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","32193037","Eur.

As of 2019, only 3 countries remained to be polio endemic globally, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. The east and southern sub-region countries had shown progressive achievement towards polio eradication and to start with the African regional certification. The availability of sensitive AFP surveillance performance is among important strategies in the achievement of polio eradication. We, therefore, decided to conduct this assessment of AFP performance from 2012 to 2019 in the ESA sub-region have evidence documentation and support the certification process of the WHO AFRO region. Methods: we reviewed all reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases from 19 countries in the ESA sub region with the date of onset of paralysis from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The data were run to descriptive analysis based on the personal characteristics and AFP surveillance performance indicators parameters. Results: a total of 46,014 AFP cases were reported from 19 countries in the ESA countries who were paralyzed from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The most affected age group was children aged 0 to 3 years old where 19,740 children with acute paralysis were reported representing 42.9% of the total reported AFP for the period. The overall assessment of the non-polio AFP rate, there is an increase from a rate of 2.7 in 2012 to 3.5 in 2019 per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years, reflects a significant change with a p-value of 0.040 (95% C.I. ranges from 0.035 to 1.564). Furthermore, the percentage of stool adequacy raised from 86.4% in 2012 to 88.5% in 2019, with an observed 2.1% difference and no significant change over the 8 years. Conclusion: we observed an overall increase in the sensitivity of the AFP surveillance performance for the ESA sub-region countries from 2012 to 2019 using the national performance indicators. The COVID-19 pandemic paused an operational challenge for AFP surveillance performances from 2020. A further subnational surveillance performance analysis is suggested. © Daudi Manyanga et al.","Acute flaccid paralysis; East and Southern Africa; Performance indicators; Polio eradication; Surveillance","acute disease; adolescent; Africa; age distribution; child; Coronavirus infection; female; health survey; human; infant; male; newborn; pandemic; paralysis; poliomyelitis; preschool child; procedures; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Africa, Eastern; Africa, Southern; Age Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pandemics; Paralysis; Pneumonia, Viral; Poliomyelitis; Population Surveillance; Retrospective Studies","32754298","Pan Afr.

We recently reported a laboratory diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 based on real-time RT-PCR assays using two primer sets, N and N2. On 30-31 January 2020, the protocol and reagents for these assays were distributed to local public health institutes and quarantine depots in Japan, and nationwide, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was started. For further validation, the assays were compared with the commercially available kits using SARS CoV-2 viral RNA and the clinical specimens obtained from COVID19-suspected individuals. The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. Thus, the N2 set has high specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These indicate that the protocol using the N and N2 sets is comparable to commercially available kits and is reliable for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.","COVID-19; real-time RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2",,"32350226","Jpn.

The present study sought to determine knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of health care workers (HCWs) toward COVID-19 in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTHs) in Uganda. Methods: An online cross sectional, descriptive study was undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among HCWs in four MUTHs. HCWs aged 18 years and above constituted the study population. KAP toward COVID-19 was assessed by using a pre-validated questionnaire. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine sufficient knowledge (≥80%), positive attitude (≥4), and good practice (≥2.4). All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 and GraphPad Prism 8.3. Results: Of the 581 HCWs approached, 136 (23%) responded. A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 87, n = 64%), with a median age of 32 (range: 20–66) years. Eighty-four (62%) were medical doctors and 125 (92%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Overall, 69% (n = 94) had sufficient knowledge, 21% (n = 29) had positive attitude, and 74% (n = 101) had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with knowledge were age >40 years (aOR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–1.0; p = 0.047) and news media (aOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.4–17.0; p = 0.015). Factors associated with good practices were age 40 years or more (aOR: 48.4; 95% CI: 3.1–742.9; p = 0.005) and holding a diploma (aOR: 18.4; 95% CI: 1–322.9; p = 0.046). Conclusions: Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices.

It is said to have originated from China and spread over more than 200 countries across the world. There have been reports of high mortality and morbidity in China, Spain, Italy, USA, UK and France due to wide spread of this dangerous and contagious disease. Unfortunately, this war is being fought by the frontline warriors i.e. doctors, nurses, health workers, sanitary staff but, with no real weapon presently, as no drug or vaccine has been found effective to deal with this deadly virus. The spread/ transmission cycle is very fast due to its very highly contagious nature and fast multiplication. Though, India has made all concerted efforts from the very beginning with all proactive actions and preparedness to deal with the situation due to coronavirus, yet it is becoming a Challenging task in some hotspots due to lack of social distancing or lockdown by some people in the community. The first phase of lockdown in the whole country started on 25th March for 21 days in order to break down the chain of transmission. However, due to its spread in some hotspots, it has been extended for another 19 days so as to well control the clusters and to prevent further spread. In an address to the Nation, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Hon. Health Minister of India stressed the need of social distancing and lockdown as comprehensive strategy for prevention and break the chain of transmission for coronavirus and term social distancing as “social vaccine” besides other measures being taken for diagnosis and treatment. An attempt has been made in this manuscript to describe the challenges and threats caused by deadly corona virus in India with the benefits of social vaccine (distancing)-the only weapon to prevent and break the transmission. © 2020: Advanced Research Publications","Covid-19; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS); Social Distancing (Vaccine); Syndrome-related Corona Viruses (SARSr-CoV)",,,"J.

Amid this situation, investigational agents are being used, including chloroquine. We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia that recovered in Colombia, after the use of chloroquine and clarithromycin. Case presentation: A 34-year-old male, returning from Spain, presented with complaints of fever, and cough, and class-II obesity, being hospitalized. The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested by FilmArray® PCR were negative. Two days later, clarithromycin was started because the patient was suspected as community-acquired pneumonia. At the third day, the rRT-PCR confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A day later, chloroquine was started because of that. His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis. Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative. The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days. Conclusions: Our patient improved significantly. This and other COVID-19 cases are urgently demanding results from clinical trials that support evidence-based therapeutical approaches to this pandemic and the clinical management of patients, especially those at critical care. © 2020 The Author(s).","Chloroquine; Colombia; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Latin America; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; chloroquine; clarithromycin; gamma glutamyltransferase; oseltamivir; paracetamol; sultamicillin; trazodone; adult; anxiety; arterial gas; arthralgia; Article; asthenia; bacterium examination; bilateral multifocal ground glass opacity; blood gas analysis; blood pressure; breathing rate; carbon dioxide tension; case report; chill; clinical article; clinical feature; Colombia; community acquired pneumonia; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia; coughing; dengue; differential diagnosis; disease course; drug efficacy; dyspnea; erythrocytosis; fatigue; fever; follow up; hand washing; heart rate; home care; hospital discharge; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; isolation; leukopenia; lung disease; lymphocytopenia; male; myalgia; obesity; oxygen saturation; oxygen supply; oxygen tension; pandemic; pH; platelet count; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; public health; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; respiratory alkalosis; respiratory tract disease; respiratory virus; rhinitis; room ventilation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social behavior; Spain; sputum; Staphylococcus auricularis; temperature; thorax radiography; thrombocytopenia; treatment duration; treatment outcome; virus examination; virus pneumonia; walking; weakness",,"Ann.

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions: Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results: Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.

Objective: To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. Results: Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results. Conclusions and Relevance: Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. Participants 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. Main outcome measures Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. Results 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. Conclusion The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease. © 2019 Author(s).",,"virus RNA; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; blood sampling; China; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; electronic medical record; feces; female; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; information processing; lung parenchyma; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; retrospective study; rural area; saliva; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; sputum; temporal analysis; urine sampling; virus load; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; severity of illness index; virology; virus load; virus pneumonia; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Viral Load","32317267","BMJ",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083871498

Nepal shares open border with India from three sides, east, south and west. And, in north with China, where the novel coronavirus infection (CVOVID-19) began in late December 2019. The first confirmed imported case in Nepal was reported in 2nd week of January 2020. The initial response of Nepal to COVID-19 were comparably slow but country geared efforts after it was declared a 'global pandemic' by WHO on 11 March, 2020. Government of Nepal's steps from 18 March, 2020 led to partial lock down and countrywide lockdown imposed on 24 March, 2020. Government devised comprehensive plan on 27 March, 2020 for quarantine for peoples who arrived in Nepal from COVID-19 affected countries. This article covers summary of global status, South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) status, and Nepal's response to contain COVID-19 infection discussed under three headings: Steps taken before and after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and lab services regarding detection of COVID-19. Nepal has documented five confirmed cases of COVID-19 till the end of March 2020, first in second week of 15 January, 2020 and 2nd case 8-weeks thereafter and 3rd case two days later, 4th on 27 March and 5th on 28 March. Four more cases detected during first week of April. Non-Pharmacological interventions like social distancing and excellent personal habits are widely practiced. Country has to enhance testing and strengthen tracing, isolation and quarantine mechanism and care of COVID-19 patients as Nepal is in risk zone because of comparably weak health system and porous borders with India.

We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Aim: To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Methods: 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. Results: Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. Conclusion: Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed. © 2020 Author(s).","cross-sectional studies; epidemiological monitoring; schizophrenia",,,"General Psychiatry",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083891039

A serologic test to identify antibody dynamics and response to SARS-CoV-2 was developed. METHODS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at 3-40 days after symptom onset. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis was nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The serodiagnostic power of the specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and consistency rate. RESULTS: The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the 4th day after symptom onset. In the confirmed patients with COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 77.3% (51/66), 100%, 100%, 80.0%, and 88.1%, and those of IgG were 83.3.3% (55/66), 95.0%, 94.8%, 83.8%, and 88.9 %. In patients with suspected COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and consistency rate of IgM were 87.5% (21/24), 100%, 100%, 95.2%, and 96.4%, and those of IgG were 70.8% (17/24), 96.6%, 85.0%, 89.1%, and 88.1%. Both antibodies performed well in serodiagnosis for COVID-19 rely on great specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the middle and later stage of the illness. Antibody detection may play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as complement approach for viral nucleid acid assays. © The Author(s) 2020.

However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)"" issued by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. . RESULTS: Clinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902). CONCLUSIONS: Detectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis. Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response. © The Author(s) 2020.

Point-of-care testing (POCT), diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care, is inherently spatial, that is, performed at points of need, and also intrinsically temporal, because it produces fast actionable results. Outbreaks generate geospatial ""hotspots."" POC strategies help control hotspots, detect spread, and speed treatment of highly infectious diseases. Objectives. To stop outbreaks, accelerate detection, facilitate emergency response for epidemics, mobilize public health practitioners, enhance community resilience, and improve crisis standards of care. Data Sources. PubMed, WWW, newsprint, others were searched until COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the US, a national emergency, and Europe, the epicenter. Coverage comprised interviews in Asia, email to/from Wuhan, papers, articles, chapters, documents, maps, flowcharts, schematics, and geospatial-associated concepts. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated literature as abstracts, ULRs, and PDFs, recovering 136 hotspot articles. More than 500 geospatial science articles were assessed for relevance to point-of-care testing. Conclusions POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount. Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources. Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.","2019-nCoV; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); crisis standards of care; Ebola virus disease; environmental stress; epidemic; geospatial care path (GCP); geospatial science; global emergency; global strategies; government failure; MERS-CoV; newdemic; novel Coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); pandemic; panepidemic; point of risk; point-of-care testing (POCT); public health crisis; safe spacing; sepsis; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); small-world network (SWN); social distancing; spatial care path (SCP); temporal",,"32298139","Arch.

The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus. © The Author(s) 2020.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. Case presentation: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. Conclusions: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases. © 2020 The Author(s).","Case report; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Manila; Philippines; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; bacterial DNA; ceftriaxone; meropenem; midazolam; oseltamivir; oxygen; vancomycin; virus RNA; adult; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; bacterium detection; blood culture; case report; chill; Chinese; clinical article; clinical feature; combination drug therapy; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coronovirus disease 2019; coughing; crackle; disease course; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; female; fever; general condition deterioration; heart arrest; hemoptysis; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; Human coronavirus 229E; influenza B; Klebsiella pneumoniae infection; loading drug dose; male; oxygen desaturation; Philippines; physical examination; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract intubation; restlessness; resuscitation; sedation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; Staphylococcus aureus infection; Streptococcus pneumonia; thorax radiography; throat culture; tracheal aspiration procedure; travel; urine volume; virus detection",,"Trop.

DESIGN Living systematic review and critical appraisal. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). RESULTS 4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included. The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine. The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting. Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed. CONCLUSION Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones. The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.",,"C reactive protein; lactate dehydrogenase; age; Article; body temperature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease severity; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; length of stay; lymphocyte count; mortality risk; physical disease by body function; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; protein blood level; sex; systematic review; virus pneumonia; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; multivariate analysis; pandemic; prognosis; theoretical model; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Hospitalization; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis","32265220","BMJ",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083072038

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings: Patient 1—a woman in her 60s—returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.

The major limitation to overcome the issue is the lack of potential vaccines or effective medicines to treat or control the disease. Considering the shortness of time to act, the purpose of the paper was to identify and categorise the climatic, socio-biological factors that influence the global super-spread of the epidemic using a theory building approach, ‘Total Interpretive Structural Modelling’ (TISM). MICMAC analysis of the identified factors, based on their interdependence categorized the triggering factors, air temperature, humidity, age, airflow and ventilation, responsible for the increased mortality rate of COVID 19 compared to SARS and MERS. So the model explains why the temperate countries of similar climatic zones and aged people are more vulnerable. It also predicts the susceptibility of countries based on their geographic locations and upcoming climatic conditions which were found to be influential in sustaining longevity and aerosol spread of the virus. Since many of these factors remain unaltered or out of human control, the linkage factors identified in this paper; change in host behaviour and number of contacts can be given priorities in order to overcome the situation. Furthermore, this is the first attempt made to understand epidemiological characteristics of COVID 19 using TISM approach. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID 19; novel Corona virus 2; SARS-CoV-2; social distancing; total interpretive structural modelling; Viral immune response; Virulency",,,"Int.

News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe. © 2020, © 2020 ASET–The Neurodiagnostic Society.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; EEG; neurodiagnostic testing; technologist safety","Hospitals; Protective clothing; Viruses; Coronaviruses; Critical moment; Healthcare workers; Infectious disease; Personal protective equipment; Resource utilizations; Standard procedures; Virus transmission; Diseases; hydroxychloroquine sulfate; hypertensive factor; levetiracetam; acute respiratory failure; aged; Article; case report; chill; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; dyspnea; electroencephalography; facial droop; fever; human; intubation; malaise; male; seizure; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tachycardia; virus myocarditis; workflow; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; infection control; pandemic; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Electroencephalography; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral","32374647","Neurodiagnostic Journal",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084482313

Design National surveillance studies, 2008-17. Setting 31 provinces in mainland China. Participants 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. Main outcome measures Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. Results From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. Conclusions China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management. © 2020 by the authors.

Healthcare professionals, especially dentists, are exposed to a higher risk of getting infected due to close contact with infected patients. The current study was conducted to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak. In addition, dentists’ knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated. A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded. After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists’ response with respect to gender and educational level.More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%)were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols. However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%. The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups. Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responseswere fromother parts of theworld. Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity. A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period. © 2020 by the authors.

Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

However, no research analyzed the spatial dependency and temporal dynamics of 2019-nCoV. Consequently, this research aims to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic using spatio-temporal analysis methods at the county level in Hubei province. The Mann–Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran’s I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population. Therefore, enhancing the ability to diagnose the disease and controlling the movement of the population can be confirmed as effective measures to prevent and control the regional outbreak of the epidemic. © 2020 by the authors.

The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. Results: The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT.

Social media search indexes (SMSI) for dry cough, fever, chest distress, coronavirus, and pneumonia were collected from 31 December 2019 to 9 February 2020. The new suspected cases of COVID-19 data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We used the lagged series of SMSI to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers during this period. To avoid overfitting, five methods, namely subset selection, forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, were used to estimate coefficients. We selected the optimal method to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We further validated the optimal method for new confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 31 December 2019 to 17 February 2020. The new suspected COVID-19 case numbers correlated significantly with the lagged series of SMSI. SMSI could be detected 6-9 days earlier than new suspected cases of COVID-19. The optimal method was the subset selection method, which had the lowest estimation error and a moderate number of predictors. The subset selection method also significantly correlated with the new confirmed COVID-19 cases after validation. SMSI findings on lag day 10 were significantly correlated with new confirmed COVID-19 cases. SMSI could be a significant predictor of the number of COVID-19 infections. SMSI could be an effective early predictor, which would enable governments’ health departments to locate potential and high-risk outbreak areas. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. Results: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8th to February 28th, 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: “low” (first), “moderate” (second), “high” (third), “high” (fourth), “high” (fifth), “high” (sixth), “high” (seventh), and “very high” (eighth). Conclusion: The KCDC's 8 risk assessments were utilized to activate national emergency response mechanisms and eventually prepare for the pandemic to ensure the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures. © 2020 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance. Objective: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China. Methods: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices. Results: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation. Conclusions: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies. The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Objective: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results: Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes. Conclusions: Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Crazy-paving; CT-scan; Enlarged pulmonary vessels; Ground glass opacities; SARS-COV2","2019 novel coronavirus; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; artificial ventilation; case report; China; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; cone beam computed tomography; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; follow up; human; human tissue; intensive care unit; Italy; laboratory test; lung blood vessel; lung infiltrate; lung lesion; male; mediastinum lymphadenopathy; multidetector computed tomography; pericardial effusion; pleura effusion; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; spiral computer assisted tomography; thorax radiography; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; isolation and purification; lung; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pandemic; pathology; SARS coronavirus; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Humans; Italy; Lung; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; SARS Virus; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32112966","Int.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p<0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). Interpretation: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control. Funding: None. © 2020 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems. © 2020 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd..

Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. Findings: All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. Interpretation: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society. © 2020 by the authors.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil. We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models. We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests. Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se = 82% [76–87]; Sp = 97% [96–98]; DOR = 168 [92–305] and SROC = 0.98 [0.96–0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se = 97% [90–99]; Sp = 98% [97–99]; DOR = 1994 [385–10334] and SROC = 0.99 [0.98–1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se = 97% [85–99]; Sp = 99% [77–100]; DOR = 2649 [30–233056] and SROC = 0.99 [0.98–1.00]. These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil.

Methods: We conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease.

The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods: We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results: We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h (including sampling, shipment and biological tests).

CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is closely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy.

The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. Methods: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R 0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Results: The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58. Conclusions: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea. © 2020 The Author(s).","Basic reproduction number; Mathematical model; Next generation matrix; Novel coronavirus; Transmissibility","2019 novel coronavirus; Article; computer simulation; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; disease carrier; high throughput sequencing; human; incubation time; infection risk; mathematical model; mortality rate; nonhuman; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; secondary infection; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; animal; bat; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; growth, development and aging; theoretical model; time factor; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Chiroptera; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pneumonia, Viral; Time Factors","32111262","Infect.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Methods: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. Findings: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. Interpretation: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. Findings: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. Interpretation: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

EPIDEMIOLOGY: The infection reached the mark of 350,000 patients in 33 countries and affected as comorbidities the presence of comorbidities and advanced age. TRANSMISSIBILITY: The transmissibility calculated so far is similar to the H1N1 epidemic, but with lower mortality rates. PHYSIOPATHOLOGY: The SARS-CoV-2 virus, of the Coronaviridae family, has the capacity for cellular invasion through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 does not have a lower respiratory epithelium and in the cells of the small intestine mucosa. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: a presentation can be divided into mild (fever, fatigue, cough, myalgia, and sputum) and severe (cyanosis, dyspnoea, tachypnea, chest pain, hypoxemia and need for clinical measurement) and has an estimated estimate of 2%. DIAGNOSIS: allows the detection of viral load in CRP-TR of patients with high clinical suspicion. TREATMENT: based on supportive measures and infection control. In severe cases, the use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or medication can be promising. Take care to avoid the use of corticosteroids.

Design Retrospective case series. Setting Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Participants 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. Main outcome measures Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification. Results Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days. Conclusion As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients. © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

Aim: We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. Methods: Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results: The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses.

However, its diagnostic efficacy remains unclear. In this study, we searched for diagnostic studies from the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases to calculate the pooled diagnostic accuracy measures using bivariate random-effects model meta-analysis. As a result, 22 from a total of 1613 articles, including 2282 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and 1485 healthy persons or patients without SARS-CoV-2, were selected for a meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve of the summary receiver operator curve (SROC) were: (a) 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.90), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and (b) 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65-0.81), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97) for IgM. A subgroup analysis among detection methods indicated the sensitivity of IgG and IgM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were slightly lower than those using gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) and chemiluminescence immunoassay (P >.05). These results showed that the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM had high diagnostic efficiency to assist the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. And, GICA might be used as the preferred method for its accuracy and simplicity. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","antibody; COVID-2019; diagnostic efficacy; SARS-CoV-2",,"32568413","J. Med.

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be instrumental in resolution of and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we tested 25 hospitalized patients either with microbiologically documented COVID-19 (n = 19) or highly suspected of having the disease (n = 6) for presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD69+ expressing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) producing CD8+ T cells using flow-cytometry for intracellular cytokine staining assay. Two sets of overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein N-terminal 1 to 643 amino acid sequence and the entire sequence of SARS-CoV-2 M protein were used simultaneously as antigenic stimulus. Ten patients (40%) had detectable responses, displaying frequencies ranging from 0.15 to 2.7% (median of 0.57 cells/µL; range, 0.43-9.98 cells/µL). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ T cells in patients admitted to intensive care was comparable (P =.28) to the rate in patients hospitalized in other medical wards. No correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ T-cell counts and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody levels. Likewise, no correlation was observed between either SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ T cells or S-specific immunoglobulin G-antibody titers and blood cell count or levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In summary, in this descriptive, preliminary study we showed that SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-γ CD8+ T cells can be detected in a non-negligible percentage of patients with moderate to severe forms of COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to determine whether quantitation of these T-cell subsets may provide prognostic information on the clinical course of COVID-19. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","CD8+ T cells; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; T-cell immunity",,"32579268","J.

Concomitant liver disease could increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, and chronic liver disease patients sometimes require frequent admission and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thus, clarifying the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 in outpatients with liver disease is essential for preventing nosocomial infections. We aimed to clarify the time-dependent changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence in liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, in an area of Japan experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. Methods: We included the preserved sera of 100, 300, and 300 consecutive liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, from May 2019, March 2020, and May 2020, respectively. The sera were analyzed immunochromatographically to detect immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (KURABO) and by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay (Roche Diagnostics). Results: Analysis of 100 cases from May 2019, before COVID-19 became pandemic, revealed that the specificity of immunochromatographic tests and Elecsys were 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93–99.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 97–100%), respectively. Analysis of 300 cases from March 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0.3% (1/300; 95% CI, 0–1.8%) for COVID-19 by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Analysis of 300 cases from May 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0% (0/300; 95% CI, 0–1.0%). Conclusions: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has high specificity. The cumulative seroprevalence of COVID-19 by the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay in outpatients with liver disease in Sapporo, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, was 0.17% (1/600; 95% CI, 0.0–0.9%) until May 2020. © 2020 The Japan Society of Hepatology","Elecsys assay; IgG; liver disease; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2COVID-19",,,"Hepatol.

Under these circumstances, ensuring the safety of donor human milk is paramount, as the risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk by pasteurisation and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk under cold storage. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally inoculated into human milk samples from healthy donors or into a control medium. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after Holder pasteurisation (63°C for 30 min), heating to 56°C for 30 min, or after 48 h of storage at 4°C or −30°C. Infectious titres of virus were determined at 72 h post-infection by endpoint titration. Results: Following heating to 63°C or 56°C for 30 min, replication competent (i.e. live) SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in both human milk and the control medium. Cold storage of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk (either at 4°C or −30°C) did not significantly impact infectious viral load over a 48 h period. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, suggesting that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 to vulnerable infants through pasteurised donor human milk. The demonstrated stability of SARS-CoV-2 in refrigerated or frozen human milk may assist in the development of guidelines around safe expressing and storing of milk from COVID-19 infected mothers. © 2020 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","COVID-19; Holder pasteurisation; pasteurised donor human milk; SARS-CoV-2; viral inactivation",,,"J.

Due to the timeframe involved, these patients may have developed humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 while still testing positive for viral RNA in swabs. Data are lacking on exposure risks in these situations. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination in an ICU and an isolation ward caring for such COVID-19 patients. Methods: We collected air and surface samples in a hospital caring for critical and severe COVID-19 cases from common areas and areas proximal to patients. Results: Of the 218 ICU samples, an air sample contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the 182 isolation ward samples, nine contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These were collected from a facemask, the floor, mobile phones, and the air in the patient room and bathroom. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in these patients at the beginning of the study. Conclusions: While there is a perception of increased risk in the ICU, our study demonstrates that isolation wards may pose greater risks to healthcare workers and exposure risks remain with clinically improved patients, weeks after their initial diagnoses. As these patients had serum antibodies, further studies may be warranted to study the utility of serum antibodies as a surrogate of viral clearance in allowing people to return to work.

Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, marked enrichment was demonstrated in a virus strain sample from cell culture, three nasopharyngeal swab samples (cycle threshold [Ct] values: 32.36, 36.72, and 38.44) from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (positive control) and four throat swab samples from patients without COVID-19 (negative controls), respectively. Moreover, based on these high-quality sequences, we discuss the heterozygosity and viral expression during coronavirus replication and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from the Genome Variation Map. Therefore, this universal SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe system can capture and enrich SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences selectively and effectively in different samples, especially clinical swab samples with a relatively low concentration of viral particles. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","gene expression; genetic networks; genetic variability; mutation; SARS coronavirus",,"32492196","J.

Currently, detection of the RNA from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the gold standard for establishing a COVID-19 diagnosis. This study evaluates the characteristic performance of the analytical system in a clinical laboratory. Methods: A commercial SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR Kit used in a clinical laboratory is assessed based on ISO 15189 verification requirements. A multiple real-time RT-PCR assay for the RdRP, N, and E genes in SARS-CoV-2 is verified. Results: The analytical system exhibits good analytical sensitivity (1000 copies/mL) and specificity (100%); however, the values of 86.7% and 100% for analytical accuracy deserved attention, compared with two other types of methods. Overall, the kit is potentially useful for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and meets the verification requirements. Conclusion: Compliance with international standards, such as ISO 15189, is valuable for clinical laboratories and for improving laboratory medicine quality and safety. Normalization is essential for obtaining reliable results from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR assay. This study aims to develop an improved SARS-CoV-2 verification framework compared with traditional molecular diagnostic methods, given the urgency of implementing new assays in clinical laboratories. © 2020 The Authors.

A matter of debate is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets. Thus, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with confirmed COVID-19. Materials and methods: A 31-year-old man with fever, myalgia, anosmia, and ageusia was tested and found positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a pharyngeal swab. Eight days after he provided semen and urine samples in which viral RNA presence was measured using a Real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting E and S viral genes. Results and discussion: Semen and urine samples search for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. Although this should be interpreted cautiously, it may be possible that either the viral clearance kinetics in these matrices matches the progressive clinical recovery of the patient or that the virus was never present in these fluids at the time of the laboratory diagnosis. © 2020, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","COVID-19; Pharyngeal swab; SARS-CoV-2; Semen fluid",,"32329026","J.

Recent bioinformatics evidence suggests that angiotensin converting enzyme 2—the main cell entry target of SARS-CoV-2—is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells, which suggests the potential vulnerability of the male reproductive system to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Objectives: To identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in seminal plasma and to determine semen characteristics from male patients in the acute and recovery phases of infection. Methods: From February 26 to April 2, 2020, 23 male patients with COVID-19 were recruited. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography scans of all patients were recorded in detail. We also investigated semen characteristics and the viral RNA load in semen from these patients in the acute and recovery phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection using approved methods. Results: The age range of the 23 patients was 20–62 years. All patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen specimens. Among them, the virus had been cleared in 11 patients, as they tested negative. The remaining 12 patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen samples, but were positive in sputum and fecal specimens. The median interval from diagnosis to providing semen samples was 32 days, when total sperm counts, total motile sperm counts and sperm morphology of the patients were within normal ranges. Discussion and Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with a recent infection or recovering from COVID-19, there was no SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in semen samples, which indicates the unlikely possibility of sexual transmission through semen at about 1 month after first detection.

Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses, however viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients. Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low-risk threat to blood safety. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood-borne pathogens noninfectious, while maintaining blood product quality. Here we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units. Materials and Methods: Stock SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero cells and inoculated into either plasma or platelet units. Those units were then treated with riboflavin and UV light. The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells. A total of five (n=5) plasma and three (n=3) platelet products were evaluated in this study. Results: In both experiments the measured titer of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light. The mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥3.40 and ≥4.53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively. Conclusion: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture. The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: A total of 15 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as the COVID-19 group, and 50 patients were enrolled as the control group. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) were detected by a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). Results: According to the cutoff value recommended by the manufacturer (cutoff = 10 AU/mL), the sensitivity, specificity, Youden index (YI), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of IgM were 60%, 100%, 60%, 100%, and 89.29%, respectively; and 86.67%, 100%, 86.67%, 100%, and 96.15%, respectively, for IgG. We reassessed the cutoff value of IgM. When the cutoff value for SARS-CoV-2 IgM was 1.83 AU/mL, the sensitivity, specificity, YI, PPV, and NPV were 93.33%, 98%, 91.33%, 93.33%, and 98%, respectively. During dynamic monitoring of the concentrations of IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients, we found the shortest times before a patient became IgM and IgG seropositive after symptom onset were 1.5 and 2 days, respectively. The longest times were 7 and 8 days, respectively. The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG both reached 100% in 8-14 days after symptom onset. Conclusion: The IgM cutoff value of 1.83 AU/mL for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was much better than the cutoff suggested by the manufacturer.

First emerging in China, it has spread rapidly across the globe, giving rise to significant social and economic costs and imposing severe strain on healthcare systems. Since many attempts to control viral spread has been futile, the only old practice of containment including city lockdown and social distancing are working to some extent. Unfortunately, specific antiviral drugs and vaccines remain un-available yet. Many factors are encountered to play essential roles in viral pathogenesis. These include a broad viral-host range with high receptor binding affinity to various human tissues, viral adaptation to humans, a high percentage of asymptomatic but infected carriers, prolonged incubation, and viral shedding periods. There are also a wide variety of pulmonary and extrapul-monary tissue damage mechanisms including direct cell injury or immune-mediated damages involving the immune cells, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and antibody dependent enhancement that can result in multi-organ failure.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples by using PCR is the standard laboratory diagnostic tool. Our aim was to perform a limited evaluation of the diagnostic performance and user-friendliness of eleven rapid tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All participants were tested with PCR against SARS-CoV-2 at a clinical microbiology laboratory. Comparing with results from PCR tests, we evaluated the rapid tests' performances in three arms; 1) 20 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 2) 23 recovered outpatients with former PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 3) 49 participants with suspected COVID-19 presenting at a primary care emergency room. All eleven tests detected antibodies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, though with varying sensitivities. In former outpatients recovered from COVID-19, there were differences between tests in the immunoglobulin type G (IgG) sensitivity, with five tests having a sensitivity below 65%. In participants with suspected COVID-19 infection, the rapid tests had very low sensitivities. Most rapid tests were easy to perform and interpret. Rapid tests were not suited as stand-alone tests to detect present infection in a Norwegian primary care emergency room population. All the rapid tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, although sensitivities varied and were generally higher in the study arm of more severely affected participants. Rapid tests with high IgG sensitivity (and specificity) may be useful for confirmation of past infection. An independent evaluation should be performed in the intended population before introducing a rapid test. © 2020 De Gruyter.

Methods: To demonstrate whether various clinical specimens contain the viable virus, we collected naso/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva, urine and stool samples from five COVID-19 patients and performed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess viral load. Specimens positive with qPCR were subjected to virus isolation in Vero cells. We also used urine and stool samples to intranasally inoculate ferrets and evaluated the virus titres in nasal washes on 2, 4, 6 and 8 days post infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all naso/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva, urine and stool samples collected between days 8 and 30 of the clinical course. Notably, viral loads in urine, saliva and stool samples were almost equal to or higher than those in naso/oropharyngeal swabs (urine 1.08 ± 0.16–2.09 ± 0.85 log10 copies/mL, saliva 1.07 ± 0.34–1.65 ± 0.46 log10 copies/mL, stool 1.17 ± 0.32 log10 copies/mL, naso/oropharyngeal swabs 1.18 ± 0.12–1.34 ± 0.30 log10 copies/mL). Further, viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva of COVID-19 patients, as well as nasal washes of ferrets inoculated with patient urine or stool. Discussion: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in saliva, urine and stool samples from COVID-19 patients up to days 11–15 of the clinical course.

By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from 38 cases with confirmed COVID-19 in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage. However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from eighth day of disease onset. Simultaneous use of antibody assay and RT-qPCR improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses. Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days. Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we present an analysis of prospectively gathered data collected at a single tertiary university hospital from 19 April to 19 May 2020. We included 13 pregnant women hospitalized with suspected COVID-19. Results of laboratory tests, imaging tests, and nucleic acid tests on vaginal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were also analyzed for pregnant women with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results: Twelve pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Mean age was 32 ± 7.9 years.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center study, and followed up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with RT-PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families was compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan Meier plot. Results: By February 29, 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty-three children had COVID-19 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal-viral-excreting children. Conclusion: Children have lower susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, longer incubation and fecal viral excretion time. Positive results of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection were not used as indication for hospitalization or quarantine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Cardiovascular complications with myocarditis and embolism due to COVID-19 have been reported. SARS-CoV-2 genome detection in the heart muscle has not been demonstrated so far, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated. Methods and results: Endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) of 104 patients (mean age: 57.90 ± 16.37 years; left ventricular ejection fraction: 33.7 ± 14.6%, sex: n = 79 male/25 female) with suspected myocarditis or unexplained heart failure were analysed. EMB analysis included histology, immunohistochemistry, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in the IKDT Berlin, Germany. Among 104 EMBs investigated, five were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by reverse real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We describe patients of different history of symptoms and time duration. Additionally, we investigated histopathological changes in myocardial tissue showing that the inflammatory process in EMBs seemed to permeate vascular wall leading to small arterial obliteration and damage. Conclusions: This is the first report that established the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes detection in EMBs. In these patients, myocardial injury ischaemia may play a role, which could explain the ubiquitous troponin increases. EMB-based identification of the cause of myocardial injury may contribute to explain the different evolution of complicated SARS-CoV-2-infection and to design future specific and personalized treatment strategies. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: We evaluated the viral dynamics in various body fluid specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, saliva, sputum, and urine specimens, of two patients with COVID-19 from hospital day 1 to 9. Additional samples of the saliva were taken at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after using a chlorhexidine mouthwash. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Results: SARS-CoV-2 was detected from all the five specimens of both patients by rRT-PCR. The viral load was the highest in the nasopharynx (patient 1 = 8.41 log10 copies/mL; patient 2 = 7.49 log10 copies/mL), but it was also remarkably high in the saliva (patient 1 = 6.63 log10 copies/mL; patient 2 = 7.10 log10 copies/mL). SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to hospital day 6 (illness day 9 for patient 2) from the saliva of both patients. The viral load in the saliva decreased transiently for 2 hours after using the chlorhexidine mouthwash. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 viral load was consistently high in the saliva; it was relatively higher than that in the oropharynx during the early stage of COVID-19. Chlorhexidine mouthwash was effective in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the saliva for a short-term period. © 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","Chlorhexidine; COVID-19; Saliva; SARS-CoV-2; Viral load","aged; Betacoronavirus; case report; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; human; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; middle aged; pandemic; saliva; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus load; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Saliva; Viral Load","32449329","J.

Pre-analytical determinants, such as sampling procedures, time and temperature storage conditions, might impact on the end result. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of sampling procedures, time and temperature of the primary nasopharyngeal swabs storage on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results. Each nasopharyngeal swab obtained from 10 hospitalized patients for COVID-19 was subdivided in 15 aliquots: five were kept at room temperature; five were refrigerated (+4 °C); five were immediately mixed with the extraction buffer and refrigerated at +4 °C. Every day and for 5 days, one aliquot per condition was analyzed (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 gene E and RNaseP and threshold cycles (Ct) compared. To evaluate manual sampling, 70 nasopharyngeal swabs were sampled twice by two different operators and analyzed separately one from the other. A total of 6/10 swabs were SARS-CoV-2 positive. No significant time or storage-dependent variations were observed in SARS-CoV-2 Ct. Re-sampling of swabs with SARS-CoV-2 Ct lower than 33 resulted in highly reproducible results (CV=2.9%), while a high variability was observed when Ct values were higher than 33 (CV=10.3%). This study demonstrates that time and temperature of nasopharyngeal swabs storage do not significantly impact on results reproducibility. However, swabs sampling is a critical step, and especially in case of low viral load, might be a potential source of diagnostic errors. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","COVID-19; nasopharyngeal swab; pre-analytical; SARS-CoV-2",,"32573469","Clin.

Currently, several quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT–qPCR) assays are being used by clinical, research and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear whether results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to make independent evaluations of primer–probe sets used in four common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. From our comparisons of RT–qPCR analytical efficiency and sensitivity, we show that all primer–probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 viral RNA copies per reaction. The exception for this is the RdRp-SARSr (Charité) confirmatory primer–probe set which has low sensitivity, probably due to a mismatch to circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the reverse primer. We did not find evidence for background amplification with pre-COVID-19 samples or recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution decreasing sensitivity. Our recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is to select an assay with high sensitivity and that is regionally used, to ease comparability between outcomes. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,,"Nat.

Accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular assays is critical for patient management and the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with mutations at the primer or probe binding sites, and these mutations may affect the sensitivity of currently available real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and open reading frame 1a or 1b genes. Using sequence-independent single-primer amplification and nanopore whole-genome sequencing, we have found that the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) gene, located at the 5′ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, was highly expressed in the nasopharyngeal or saliva specimens of 9 COVID-19 patients of different clinical severity. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel nsp1 real-time RT-PCR assay. The primers and probes are highly specific for SARS-CoV-2. Validation with 101 clinical specimens showed that our nsp1 RT-PCR assay has a sensitivity of 93.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.2%-97.2%), which was similar to those of N and E gene RT-PCR assays. The diagnostic specificity was 100% (95% CI: 92.9%-100%).

According to data on the quantification of the infective power of such aerosol with small size particles and if such air transmission was confirmed, a larger use of N95 respirators should be promoted particularly in health care units. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SASLa connaissance des modes de transmission du SARS-CoV-2 est un élément fondamental dans l’élaboration des stratégies de prévention en santé au travail et en santé publique dans le cadre de la gestion de crise du Covid-19. Le SARS-CoV-2 est retrouvé dans les voies aériennes des patients, y compris asymptomatiques. Les données récentes de la littérature suggèrent un risque de transmission du SARS-CoV-2 par voie aérienne qui a probablement été sous-estimé, notamment via des aérosols générés par la toux ou les éternuements, mais aussi plus simplement la parole et la respiration, et donc la composition est majoritairement le fait de particules dont le diamètre est inférieur ou égal à 1 μm. Des données préliminaires montrent la présence d'ARN viral dans l'air et sur des surfaces distantes des patients sources. Cependant, il est important de noter que la détection de matériel génétique viral par RT-PCR ne signifie pas que le virus soit vivant et infectant. En fonction de données sur la quantification du pouvoir infectant des aérosols de petite taille et si l'hypothèse d'une telle transmission était confirmée, les indications de port des protections respiratoires de type FFP2 mériteraient d’être élargies, notamment en milieu de soin. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Composition; Composition; Covid; Covid; Occupational health; Prevention; Prévention; Santé au travail",,,"Arch.

Research has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through close contact via respiratory droplets, but there is the possibility for ocular transmission, with the conjunctiva as a conduit as well as a source of infection. Discussion: Ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 include follicular conjunctivitis, and have been repeatedly noted as an initial or subsequent symptom of COVID-19-positive patients. Particularly in patients with ocular manifestations, there is evidence that the virus may present in tears, based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swab samples via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The virus may therefore be transmittable from the ocular surface to a new host via contact with the ocular mucosa, tears, or subsequent fomites. Conclusions: All health care professionals should ask patients about ocular symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2, and use eye protection such as goggles or face shields as part of the standard personal protective equipment for high-risk patients in addition to wearing of masks by both the patient and provider, and should consider tears to be potentially infectious. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","conjunctivitis; COVID-19; ocular transmission; ophthalmic precautions; SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

We report the case of a 64-year-old male patient who underwent explantation of a shoulder prosthesis due to a periprosthetic infection. He was tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 7 days after admission to the orthopaedic department following strict infection control measures, routinely including screening all patients for multi-drug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization upon admission. Aim of our study is to report on the spreading potential of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare setting if standard contact precautions and infection control measures have been established. Methods: All HCW with exposure to the patient from day of admission until confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified and underwent oropharyngeal swab testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Sixty-six HCW were identified: nine orthopaedic surgeons, four anaesthesiologists, 25 orthopaedic nurses, five nurse anesthetists, eight scrub nurses, five nursing students, two medical assistants and seven service employees. Fourteen HCW (21%) showed clinical symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection: cough (n = 4), sore throat (n = 3), nasal congestion (n = 3), dyspnea (n = 2), fever (n = 1), headache and myalgia (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the 66 HCW. Conclusion: Hygienic measures and contact precautions, aimed at preventing the spread of MRDO, may have helped to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCW—despite high-risk exposure during intubation, surgical treatment and general care.

The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual's risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were collected. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score. Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 vs. 11 (scale 0-14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001). Using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 95%, respectively. The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters. This algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection status of patients presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms. © 2020","algorithm; coronavirus; COVID-19; emergency department; pandemic; prediction-model; SARS-CoV-2",,"32598302","Clin.

We investigated temporal transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with longitudinal faecal microbiome alterations in patients with COVID-19. Design: We performed RNA shotgun metagenomics sequencing on serial faecal viral extractions from 15 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Sequencing coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was quantified. We assessed faecal microbiome composition and microbiome functionality in association with signatures of faecal SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Results: Seven (46.7%) of 15 patients with COVID-19 had stool positivity for SARS-CoV-2 by viral RNA metagenomic sequencing. Even in the absence of GI manifestations, all seven patients showed strikingly higher coverage (p=0.0261) and density (p=0.0094) of the 3' vs 5' end of SARS-CoV-2 genome in their faecal viral metagenome profile. Faecal viral metagenome of three patients continued to display active viral infection signature (higher 3' vs 5' end coverage) up to 6 days after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples. Faecal samples with signature of high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of bacterial species Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella tanakaei, Streptococcus infantis, Morganella morganii, and higher functional capacity for nucleotide de novo biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis and glycolysis, whereas faecal samples with signature of low-to-none SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, Parabacteroides merdae, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1_1_57FAA.

By investigating 17 acute and 24 convalescent patients, we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in broad immune cell reduction including T, natural killer, monocyte, and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs were significantly reduced with functional impairment, and ratios of conventional DCs to plasmacytoid DCs were increased among acute severe patients. Besides lymphocytopenia, although neutralizing antibodies were rapidly and abundantly generated in patients, there were delayed receptor binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific T cell responses during the first 3 weeks after symptoms onset. Moreover, acute RBD- and NP-specific T cell responses included relatively more CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells. Our findings provided evidence that impaired DCs, together with timely inverted strong antibody but weak CD8 T cell responses, could contribute to acute COVID-19 pathogenesis and have implications for vaccine development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.COVID-19 is an acute disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is an increasing number of cases described as (meningo)encephalitis although evidence often lacks. Anosmia, another atypical form of COVID-19, has been considered as testimony of the potential of neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, though this hypothesis remains highly speculative. We did a review of the cases reported as brain injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. Over 98 papers found, 21 were analyzed. Only four publications provided evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the central nervous system (CNS). When facing acute neurological abnormalities during an infectious episode it is often difficult to disentangle neurological symptoms induced by the brain infection and those due to the impact of host immune response on the CNS. Cytokines release can disturb neural cells functioning and can have in the most severe cases vascular and cytotoxic effects. An inappropriate immune response can lead to the production of auto-antibodies directed toward CNS components. In the case of proven SARS-CoV-2 brain invasion, the main hypothesis found in the literature focus on a neural pathway, especially the direct route via the nasal cavity, although the virus is likely to reach the CNS using other routes. Our ability to come up with hypotheses about the mechanisms by which the virus might interact with the CNS may help to keep in mind that all neurological symptoms observed during COVID-19 do not always rely on CNS viral invasion. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","anosmia; central nervous system; COVID-19; encephalitis; meningitis; SARS-CoV-2",,"32672843","J.

We conducted the first nationwide population study using a probability-based sample to assess active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, combined with a longitudinal follow-up of the entire cohort over the next 6 months. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing results and the first 3-week follow-up results are presented. Methods: A probability-based sample of the Slovenian population comprising data from 2.1 million people was selected from the Central Population Register (n = 3000). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal samples using the cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay. Each participant filled in a detailed baseline questionnaire with basic sociodemographic data and detailed medical history compatible with COVID-19. After 3 weeks, participants were interviewed for the presence of COVID-19–compatible clinical symptoms and signs, including in household members, and offered immediate testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA if indicated. Results: A total of 1368 individuals (46%) consented to participate and completed the questionnaire. Two of 1366 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (prevalence 0.15%; posterior mean 0.18%, 95% Bayesian confidence interval 0.03–0.47; 95% highest density region (HDR) 0.01–0.41). No newly diagnosed infections occurred in the cohort during the first 3-week follow-up round. Conclusions: The low prevalence of active COVID-19 infections found in this study accurately predicted the dynamics of the epidemic in Slovenia over the subsequent month.

In the control group, 1589 individuals without clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue) and returning from outside Shenzhen were enrolled. The first study enrollment occurred at the end of February 2020; the final study visit was 18 March 2020. In the COVID-19 group, the seven of nine patients were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA. Meanwhile, six of the 1589 healthy individuals were found to be weakly positive for IgG. According to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, the six individuals were all negative. Strong supplemental support for clinical information can be provided by antibody detection, especially for IgA. According to comparison with overseas reports, the infection rate of the Chinese population outside Shenzhen, China, is significantly low, so most of the population in China is still susceptible. Hence, social distancing measures are still inevitable until a vaccine is developed successfully. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; IgA; IgG; IgM; SARS-CoV-2",,"32710647","J. Med.

However, some patients also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in feces of infected patients. Currently there is huge evolving research interest in this potentially lethal disease. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence suggesting involvement of the digestive system in COVID-19. Methods PubMed, Medline and Embase databases were searched up to 10 April 2020, using suitable keywords. Individual and pooled prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the fixed-or random-effects model as appropriate. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated employing the Cochran Q test and I2 values, whereas the possibility of publication bias was examined by constructing funnel plots. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence rates (95%CI) for all GI symptoms, and separately for diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal discomfort/pain were 9.8% (6.4-14.7), 10.4% (95%CI 7.7-13.9), 7.7% (95%CI 4.8-12.1), and 6.9% (95%CI 3.9-11.9) respectively. The prevalence rates for children were 9.6% (95%CI 6.3-14.3) for all symptoms, 9.6% (95%CI 6.3-14.3) for diarrhea, and 6.8% (95% CI 4.2-11) for nausea/vomiting. In 30.3% (95%CI 10.5-61.6) of the patients SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in feces. Conclusions A percentage of patients with COVID-19 will manifest symptoms from the digestive system. The GI tract may be a target organ and potential transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for disease management and transmission. © 2020 Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology.","Abdominal pain; COVID-19; Diarrhea; GI symptoms; Meta-analysis; Nausea; SARS-CoV-2; Stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA; Systematic review; Vomiting","abdominal discomfort; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; gastrointestinal symptom; human; meta analysis; nausea; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; prevalence; publication bias; quality control; sensitivity analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vomiting",,"Ann.

We aim to characterize the longitudinal test results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and to explore the association with disease severity. Methods: We included laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, who were hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital and excluded those who had not received anal swabs for SARS-COV-2 RNA testing. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained. Throat swabs and anal swabs were collected periodically for SARS-COV-2 RNA detection. Results: Two hundred and seventeen eligible patients (median aged 50 years, 50.2% were females) were analyzed. 21.2% (46/217) of the patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs. The duration of viral RNA was longer, but the viral load was lower in anal swabs than throat swabs in the early stage of the disease. During a median follow-up of 20 days, 30 (13.8%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxemia. Detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-5.24), increased C-reactive protein (aHR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.35-7.32) and lymphocytopenia (aHR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.46-6.67) were independently associated with ICU admission. The cumulative incidence of ICU admission was higher among patients with detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (26.3% vs 10.7%, P =.006).

However, combined throat/nasal sampling as a testing method has several advantages. We compared the combined throat/nasal sampling with nasopharyngeal sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers suspected of COVID-19. Methods: In 107 healthcare workers with symptoms of COVID-19, combined throat/nasal sampling and nasopharyngeal sampling was performed. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by RT-PCR targeting. Results: A total of 80 healthcare workers (74.8%) tested negative with both sampling methods, and 25 healthcare workers (23.4%) tested positive with both sampling methods. There were two discrepant results with positive PCR in combined throat/nasal swabs and negative PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs (1.9%). The κ index for concordance between the 2 sampling methods was high (0.95). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR on nasopharyngeal samples was significantly lower than the Ct value of PCR on combined throat/nasal samples (19 (IQR 17–20) versus 21 (IQR 18–29) cycles, p value 0.01). Conclusion: Combined throat/nasal swabs yield a similar sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 as nasopharyngeal swabs and are a good alternative sampling method, despite a lower Ct value for the nasopharyngeal samples. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID; Detection; Sampling methods; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Eur.

Early identification of this novel coronavirus by molecular tools is critical for surveillance and control of the epidemic outbreak. We aimed to establish a simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV. Primers of our in-house reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I, and AluI to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In this report, a 396-bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345-bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Enzyme Tsp45I cuts the RdRP-amplified product of SARS-CoV-2 generating three fragments of 45, 154, and 197 bp, but it did not cut the amplicon of SARS-CoV. In contrast, the amplified product of SARS-CoV was digested with EcoRI producing two fragments of 76 and 320 bp, whereas the amplicon of SARS-CoV-2 was undigested by Tsp45I help to distinguish clearly SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV on gel electrophoresis. In addition, AluI cut the amplicon of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 generating two fragments of 248 and 97 bp without cutting to SARS-CoV. The accuracy of the assay was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. When evaluated on clinical samples showed a high sensitivity of 95%, specificity of our assay was 100% and clinical performance for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other reference assays.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the VIASURE SARS-CoV-2 S gene RT-PCR Kit on the BD Max™ system and to compare results with those obtained with the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test on the cobas® 6800 system. Methods: For testing the analytical performance, reference material was used. Clinical samples (n = 101) obtained from individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were studied. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by using either ESwab™ or UTM™ collection systems. Results: When the analytical performance was evaluated, the sample containing the lowest SARS-CoV-2 concentration tested negative with the VIASURE test whereas results obtained with the cobas® test were found to be concordant with the results expected. Six out of the 101 clinical samples (5.9%) showed an inhibition with the VIASURE test. When analysing the remaining 95 clinical samples, 27 were found to be negative with both assays. Of 68 samples that were positive with the cobas® test, the VIASURE test missed 21 (30.9 %) samples. All of those 21 samples had shown Ct values ≥ 31 with the cobas® 6800 system. None of the samples tested positive with the VIASURE test and negative with the cobas® test. Conclusions: The VIASURE test was impaired by a lack of sensitivity and a relatively high number of invalid results.

However, only few patients proved positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relationship between this skin manifestation and COVID-19 infection has not been clarified yet. Objective: To thoroughly characterize a prospective group of patients with chilblain-like lesions and to investigate the possible relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Following informed consent, patients underwent (i) clinical evaluation, (ii) RT-PCR and serology testing for SARS-CoV-2, (iii) digital videocapillaroscopy of finger and toe nailfolds, (iv) blood testing to screen for autoimmune diseases and coagulation anomalies, and (v) skin biopsy for histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and, in selected cases, electron microscopy. Results: Nineteen patients, all adolescents (mean age: 14 years), were recruited. 11/19 (58%) of them and/or their cohabitants reported flu-like symptoms one to two months prior to skin manifestation onset. Lesions were localized to toes and also heels and soles. Videocapillaroscopy showed pericapillary oedema, dilated and abnormal capillaries, and microhaemorrhages both in finger and toe in the majority of patients. Major pathological findings included epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in two cases. Blood examinations were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were negative. Importantly, IgA serology for S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was positive in 6 patients and borderline in 3. Conclusions: Chilblain-like lesions during COVID-19 pandemic have specific epidemiologic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histopathological characteristics, which distinguish them from idiopathic perniosis. Though we could not formally prove SARS-CoV-2 infection in our patients, history data and the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 IgA strongly suggest a relationship between skin lesions and COVID-19.

The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives: To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants: In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results: Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided.

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56°C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. Methods: By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay. Results: We showed that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non–COVID-19 disease group (n = 9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cutoff value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Conclusion: Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended, and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating. © 2020 The Authors.

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. A great concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID-19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex-hormone evaluation in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID-19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow-up. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; male gonadal function; SARS-CoV-2; semen analysis; sex-related hormones",,"32621617","J.

More than twelve million COVID-19 cases and 500 thousand fatalities have been reported in 216 countries. Although SARS-CoV-2 originated in China, comparatively fewer people have been affected in other Asian countries than in Europe and the USA. This study examined the hypothesis that lower temperature may increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by comparing attack rate and case fatality rate (until 21 March 2020) to mean temperature in January–February 2020. The attack rate was highest in Luxembourg followed by Italy and Switzerland. There was a significant (p = 0.02) correlation between decreased attack rate and increased environmental temperature. The case fatality rate was highest in Italy followed by Iran and Spain. There was no significant correlation between the case fatality rate and temperature. This study indicates that lower temperature may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as an increased attack rate), but there is no evidence that temperature affects the severity of the disease (measured as case fatality rate).

For acute respiratory infection, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions. Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR. Three targets, RdRP, E, and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

We find that the sarbecoviruses—the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2—undergo frequent recombination and exhibit spatially structured genetic diversity on a regional scale in China. SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor-binding motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses and not one acquired recently via recombination. To employ phylogenetic dating methods, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were shown to be consistent for these three approaches and for two different prior specifications of evolutionary rates based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1879–1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930–2000) and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948–2009), indicating that the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed in bats for decades. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,"32724171","Nat.

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. Thirty-six subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Conjunctival swabs were collected from 18 patients with conjunctivitis and 18 patients without conjunctivitis and RT-PCR was performed. Conjunctival swab was collected from both eyes of 36 patients (72 eyes), detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival swab of two patients (5.5%). Among the 18 patients with conjunctivitis, only one of them (5.5%) showed positive results. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one patient without conjunctivitis (5.5%). The mean age of the 36 patients was 67.9 years (range, 28-92 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.44 (16:20). The mean days since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms until conjunctivitis manifestation was 8 (range, 1-24 days). The mean duration of the conjunctivitis was 3 days (range, 1-7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected in conjunctival swabs of both patients with and without conjunctivitis. This study revealed the same rate of positive results amongst the group with and without conjunctivitis, suggesting that detecting SARS-CoV-2 in ocular fluids is not conditioned on the presence of conjunctivitis.

Further monitoring of the disease prognosis and effective control of the ""relapse"" of the epidemic become the next focus of work. To analyse the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which may provide evidence to establish discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. Methods: We included 13 discharged COVID-19 patients who were quarantined for 4-week at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Results: The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 – 44 days with an average of 25 ± 6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 – 14 days after discharge. The rate of a recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31%(4/13). Conclusion: Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID-19 patients indicate potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID-19 and a negative result be added to the criteria. Simultaneously, we should strengthen the regular follow-up of discharged patients with continuous monitoring of the recurrence of viral nucleic acid. This article is protected by copyright.

Several factors may contribute to this observation, including the effect of lockdown, social distancing, lower humidity, lower air pollution, and potential changes in the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus. In this regard, the clinical severity of COVID-19 could be attenuated by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome that decrease its virulence, as well as by lower virus inocula. In this pilot study, we compared the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification profile of 100 nasopharyngeal swabs consecutively collected in April, during the peak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to that of 100 swabs collected using the same procedure in May. The mean Ct value of positive samples collected in May was significantly higher than that of samples collected in the previous period (ORF 1a/b gene: 31.85 ± 0.32 vs. 28.37 ± 0.5, p<0.001; E gene: 33.76 ± 0.38 vs. 29.79 ± 0.63, p<0.001), suggesting a lower viral load at the time of sampling. No significant differences were observed between male and females in the two periods, whilst higher viral loads were found in (i) patients over 60-years old, and (ii) patients that experienced severe COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic. This pilot study prompts further investigation on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 load and different clinical manifestation of COVID-19 during different phases of the pandemic.

The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM.

The high rate of contagion and the spread of the virus in the population make the early detection of the pathogen the means for the adequate targeting of infection control measures. WHO directs sample collection on upper respiratory specimens, including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients, as well as lower respiratory specimens: sputum and/or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage, in addition to citing blood and feces. Among the various sample collection methods, saliva has been investigated and reported as a potential source for diagnosis. Thus, we propose to evaluate the current scenario, based on recent publications on the perspective of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva as a diagnostic method for Covid-19. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 through saliva seems to be very promising, although obstacles such as the technique and the location of the collection and the sample size of the research carried out so far may present a limitation for its use. The current scenario presents saliva as a reliable method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, due to the ease of obtaining the samples, the possibility of self-collection, low cost because there is no need to use specific equipment, in addition to reducing the risk of transmission for health professionals. © 2020, Association of Support to Oral Health Research (APESB).

Because of the overwhelming use of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests worldwide, the availability of test kits has become a major bottleneck and the need to increase testing throughput is rising. We aim to overcome these challenges by pooling samples together, and performing RNA extraction and RT-PCR in pools. Methods: We tested the efficiency and sensitivity of pooling strategies for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We tested 184 samples both individually and in pools to estimate the effects of pooling. We further implemented Dorfman pooling with a pool size of eight samples in large-scale clinical tests. Results: We demonstrated pooling strategies that increase testing throughput while maintaining high sensitivity. A comparison of 184 samples tested individually and in pools of eight samples showed that test results were not significantly affected. Implementing the eight-sample Dorfman pooling to test 26 576 samples from asymptomatic individuals, we identified 31 (0.12%) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, achieving a 7.3-fold increase in throughput. Discussion: Pooling approaches for SARS-CoV-2 testing allow a drastic increase in throughput while maintaining clinical sensitivity.

Immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG are commonly used to serologically diagnose COVID-19; however, the role of IgA is not well known. We aimed to quantify the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, identify changes in them based on COVID-19 severity, and establish the significance of combined antibody detection. COVID-19 patients, divided into a severe and critical group and a moderate group, and non-COVID-19 patients with respiratory disease were included in this study. A chemiluminescence method was used to detect the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG in the blood samples from the three groups. Epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, blood test results and other data were recorded for all patients. Compared to the traditional IgM–IgG combined antibodies, IgA–IgG combined antibodies are more effective for diagnosing COVID-19. During the disease process, IgA appeared first and disappeared last. All three antibodies had significantly higher levels in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients. IgA and IgG were also higher for severe and critical disease than for moderate disease. All antibodies were at or near low levels at the time of tracheal extubation in critical patients. Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific combined IgA–IgG antibodies is advantageous in diagnosing COVID-19. IgA detection is suitable during early and late stages of the disease. IgA and IgG levels correspond to disease severity. © 2020 The Authors.

We report epidemiologic data from a study investigating a cohort of women who became pregnant just before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 138 consecutive pregnant women attending for first trimester screening (11-13 weeks of gestation) at Sant'Anna Hospital, Turin, Piedmont, Italy, during the plateau and the falling phase of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. Patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 detection in sera and nasopharyngeal swab samples. COVID-19 cumulative incidence during the first trimester was of 10.1% with high prevalence of asymptomatic patients (42.8%). Similar to the course of the disease in non pregnant adults, 80-90% of infections were not severe. The prevalence of reported symptoms was four-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (57%) than in those negative (13%) (p<0.001), suggesting that direct self-testing should open doors to confirmatory testing for COVID-19.

In this study, we assessed the use of posterior oropharyngeal saliva as specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an automated point-of-care molecular assay. Archived nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens of 58 COVID-19 patients were tested with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either NPS or saliva specimens of all patients. Among them, 84.5% (49/58) tested positive in both NPS and saliva, 10.3% (6/58) tested positive in NPS only, and 5.2% (3/58) tested positive in saliva only. No significant difference in the detection rate was observed between NPS and saliva (McNemar’s test p = 0.5078). The detection rate was slightly higher for N2 (NPS 94.8% and Saliva 93.1%) than that of the E gene target (Saliva: 89.7% vs 82.8%) on both specimen types. Significantly earlier median Ct value was observed for NPS comparing to that of saliva on both E (26.8 vs 29.7, p = 0.0002) and N2 gene target (29.3 vs 32.3, p = 0.0002). The median Ct value of E gene target was significantly earlier than that of the N2 gene target for both NPS (26.8 vs 29.3, p &lt; 0.0001) and saliva (29.7 vs 32.3, p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, posterior oropharyngeal saliva and NPS were found to have similar detection rates in the point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Since posterior oropharyngeal saliva can be collected easily, the use of saliva as an alternative specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 detection is recommended. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

A total of 1006 nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium from persons under investigation were tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of routine clinical care using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test with subsequent evaluation by the LDT. Cycle threshold values were analyzed and interpreted as either positive (“detected” or “presumptive positive”), negative (not detected), inconclusive, or invalid. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. The cobas SARS-CoV-2 test reported 706 positive and 300 negative results. The LDT reported 640 positive, 323 negative, 34 inconclusive, and 9 invalid results. When excluding inconclusive and invalid results, the overall percent agreement between the two platforms was 95.8%. Cohen's κ coefficient was 0.904 (95% confidence interval, 0.875-0.933), suggesting almost perfect agreement between both platforms. An overall discordance rate of 4.2% between the two systems may reflect differences in primer sequences, assay limit of detection, or other factors, highlighting the importance of comparing the performance of different testing platforms. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronavirus; RNA extraction; SARS",,"32383179","J.

Objective: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the myocardial tissue from autopsy cases and to document a possible cardiac response to that infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from consecutive autopsy cases from Germany between April 8 and April 18, 2020. All patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab tests. Exposures: Patients who died of coronavirus disease 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cardiac tissue as well as CD3+, CD45+, and CD68+cells in the myocardium and gene expression of tumor necrosis growth factor α, interferon γ, chemokine ligand 5, as well as interleukin-6, -8, and -18. Results: Cardiac tissue from 39 consecutive autopsy cases were included. The median (interquartile range) age of patients was 85 (78-89) years, and 23 (59.0%) were women. SARS-CoV-2 could be documented in 24 of 39 patients (61.5%). Viral load above 1000 copies per μg RNA could be documented in 16 of 39 patients (41.0%). A cytokine response panel consisting of 6 proinflammatory genes was increased in those 16 patients compared with 15 patients without any SARS-CoV-2 in the heart. Comparison of 15 patients without cardiac infection with 16 patients with more than 1000 copies revealed no inflammatory cell infiltrates or differences in leukocyte numbers per high power field. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of autopsy cases, viral presence within the myocardium could be documented. While a response to this infection could be reported in cases with higher virus load vs no virus infection, this was not associated with an influx of inflammatory cells. Future investigations should focus on evaluating the long-term consequences of this cardiac involvement. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Methods: In this unmatched (1:2) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 326 controls collected before SARS-CoV-2 emergence. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had high diagnostic accuracies with AUCs of 0.990 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.983-0.996) and 0.978 (95%CI: 0.967-0.989), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.01). Taking an assessed 15% inter-assay imprecision into account, an optimized IgG ratio cut-off > 2.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 99-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 96-100). A 0.8 cut-off displayed a 94% sensitivity (95%CI: 88-97) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 95-99). Substituting the upper threshold for the manufacturer's, improved assay performance, leaving 8.9% of IgG ratios indeterminate between 0.8-2.5. Conclusions: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples, with no obvious gains from IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals in our study population have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not. IgG serology should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage. © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","COVID-19; ELISA; Pseudovirus neutralisation assay; Recombinant immunofluorescence assay; SARS-CoV-2; Serological assays; Serological testing strategy",,"32603801","Clin.

In elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 is associated with high mortality, frequently caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examine in situ expression of SARS-CoV-2 in airways and lung obtained at autopsy of individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Seven autopsy cases (male, N = 5; female, N = 2) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a median age of 66 years (range, 50–77 years) were evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS Nucleocapsid protein in correlation with clinical parameters. The median time from symptom onset to death was 9 days (range, 6–31 days), from hospitalization 7 days (range, 1–21 days), from positive RT-PCR 7 days (range, 0–18 days), and from intensive care unit admission defining onset of respiratory failure 3 days (range, 1–18 days). Chest imaging identified diffuse airspace disease in all patients corresponding to acute and (N = 5) or organizing (N = 2) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histologic examination. Among five patients with acute-phase DAD (≤7 days from onset of respiratory failure), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pulmonary pneumocytes and ciliated airway cells (N = 5), and in upper airway epithelium (N = 2). In two patients with organizing DAD (>14 days from onset of respiratory failure), no virus was detected in lungs or airways. No endothelial cell infection was observed. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure can be detected during the acute phase of lung injury and is absent in the organizing phase. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.",,,,"Mod.

Materials and methods: A total of 8679 healthcare workers and healthcare support staff in the county of Uppsala, north of Stockholm, were included in this cross-sectional study. All subjects were analysed for IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2, and predictors for positive serostatus were analysed in a logistic regression model including demographic parameters and self-reported employment characteristics. Results: Overall, 577 (6.6%) were classified as seropositive, with no statistically significant differences between healthcare workers and support staff. Among healthcare workers, age (OR 0.987 per year, 95% CI 0.980–0.995), time to sampling (OR 1.019 per day, 95% CI 1.004–1.035), and employment at an outpatient care unit (OR 0.620, 95% CI 0.487–0.788) were statistically significantly associated with risk of infection.

Serum antibody testing is becoming one of the critical methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. We investigated IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein after symptom onset in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. 130 blood samples from 38 COVID-19 patients were collected. The levels of IgM and IgG specific to N and S protein were detected by ELISA. A series of blood samples were collected along the disease course from the same patient, including 11 ICU patients and 27 non-ICU patients for longitudinal analysis. N and S specific IgM and IgG (N-IgM, N-IgG, S-IgM, S-IgG) in non-ICU patients increased after symptom onset. N-IgM and S-IgM in some non-ICU patients reached a peak in the second week, while N-IgG and S-IgG continued to increase in the third week. The combined detection of N and S specific IgM and IgG could identify up to 75% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the first week. S-IgG was significantly higher in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients in the third week. In contrast, N-IgG was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. The increase of S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients. N and S specific IgM and IgG increased gradually after symptom onset and can be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of the dynamics of S-IgG may help to predict prognosis. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, encased in a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane and consists of four structural proteins (S, M, E and N), plus a haemagglutinin-sterase. The binding of the S protein to the ECA2 receptor allows the entry of the virus into the host cell and is a potential therapeutic target. 81% of patients develop mild symptoms, 14% have severe symptoms and 5% require intensive care management. Fever is the most frequent symptom, followed by cough and dyspnea. Most patients do not present leukocytosis, but they do present lymphopenia with sputum cultures that do not show other pathogens. In lung biopsies of severe patients, the most noticeable finding is diffuse alveolar damage. Radiologically, ground glass and alveolar patterns are observed; the lesions being predominantly basal, subpleural, and posterior, with a multifocal peripheral distribution, more affecting the right lower lobe. There is a marked inflammatory response, up to the cytokine storm, in which anti-inflammatory treatment with pulse therapy with methylprednisolone would be indicated. Although there are no large-scale studies regarding the use of chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine, due to the global situation, its use has been authorized for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-inflammatory effect, which can be potentiated with the use of azithromycin. © 2020, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

Discordant findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples were noted in early reports.Methods:Sampling of air close to 6 asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients with and without surgical masks was performed with sampling devices using sterile gelatin filters. Frequently-Touched environmental surfaces near 21 patients were swabbed before daily environmental disinfection. The correlation of viral load of patients' clinical samples and environmental samples were analyzed.Results:All the air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the 6 patients singly isolated inside airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIR) with 12 air change per hour. Nineteen (5.0%) of 377 environmental samples near 21 patients were RT-PCR positive with a median viral load of 9.2x102 copies/ml (range: 1.1x102 to 9.4x104 copies/ml). The contamination rate was highest on patients' mobile phone (7.8%, 6/77), followed by bed rail (5.4%, 4/74) and toilet door handle (5.3%, 4/76). There was a significant correlation between viral load ranges in clinical samples and positivity rate of environmental samples (p &lt; 0.001).Conclusion:SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detectable by air sampler which suggests that airborne route is not the predominant mode of transmission of COVID-19. Wearing of surgical mask, appropriate hand hygiene and thorough environmental disinfection are sufficient infection control measures for COVID-19 patients isolated singly in AIIR.

Hospitals faced something unexpected, and they underwent a deep change and so did orthopaedic activity. Materials and methods: In “A. Gemelli” University hospital new protocols were adopted for the safe management of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. Among these patients, six had to be treated also for orthopaedic problems. The management of these patients, from the admission in the Emergency Room (E.R). to the operating room (O.R.), followed the protocols we developed for the coronavirus crisis. Results: Four among the six patients underwent surgical treatments. Two of them showed a change of their clinical status, due to a worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, so the surgical option was postponed. All of them were admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit, rather than the Orthopaedic and Traumatology Unit, in order to provide the best measures to prevent the spread of the contagion and to ensure the best treatment for COVID-19. No O.R. staff was infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: More studies are needed to provide a higher statistical significance to the safety measures taken in order to contrast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Surgical Room. Orthopaedic surgeons are more exposed to the contagion due to the particular tools set they use. A more sensible and specific quick test for novel Coronavirus is particularly needed, due to the lack of sensitivity of the serological rapid test. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Fractures; Pandemic; Trauma",,,"Int.

Although the symptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 generally show respiratory distress, atypical manifestations such as conjunctivitis are also observed. A series of cases is reported in which reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. However, the transmission of the virus through ocular fluids remains unknown. Case description: In this case report, the development of conjunctivitis is presented as the sole symptom of a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an emergency health care worker. The patient’s first application was to the ophthalmology clinic due to redness, stinging, tearing, and photophobia for one day in the right eye. The patient had no symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue. Two days later, the RT-PCR test, blood analysis, and chest computed tomography (CT) were applied to the patient for being in contact with a COVID positive patient. Conjunctival swabs did not identify SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. However, nasopharyngeal swab and blood test confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT did not show pneumonia. Conclusion: This phenomenon shows that conjunctivitis may occur as a sole manifestation of COVID-19 which needs to be carefully evaluated by health care workers and eye care professionals during the pandemic. © The Author(s) 2020.","Conjunctivitis; COVID-19; novel coronavirus; ocular infection; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Eur.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect multiple organ systems, including the digestive tract. Little is known about the consequences of COVID-19 infection in emergency surgical patients. Methods: Perioperative data for COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgery from March 1, 2020, to May 23, 2020 were collected prospectively (NCT04323644). Results: During this period, 215 patients underwent surgery, including 127 patients in an emergency setting, of whom 13 (10.2%) had COVID-19. Two scenarios were identified: (a) patients who were admitted to a hospital for an acute surgical condition with a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19, and (b) patients with severe COVID-19 developing acute abdominal pathologies during their hospital stay. When compared with those in group B, patients in group A globally recovered better, with a lower mortality rate (14.3% vs. 33.3%), lower ARDS rate (28.5% vs. 50.0%), less rates of preoperative invasive ventilation (14.3% vs. 50.0%) and postoperative invasive ventilation (28.5% vs. 100.0%), and a shorter duration of invasive ventilation. No causality between SARS-CoV-2 infection and gastrointestinal affliction was found. Conclusion: Our observations underline that mild co-infection with COVID-19 did not result in more complications for emergency abdominal surgery.

The external validation of their performance is needed before use in clinical routine practice. Our study aims at assessing the analytical and clinical performance of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests detecting antibodies directed against the virus nucleocapsid protein: The NovaLisa SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) test (NovaTec) allowing a separate detection of each antibody and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test (Bio-Rad) detecting total antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG). Two-hundred and eight coronavirus disease 2019 samples from 48 quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed patients were used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 79) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis. In addition, using receiver operator characteristic curves, adapted cut-off for improvement of the performances were proposed. The kinetics of these antibodies was also assessed over 8 weeks. Two weeks after the RT-qPCR positive detection, the NovaLisa test shows a sensitivity and specificity of 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.1%-98.6%) and 96.2% (95% CI: 89.4%-98.7%) for IgG, of 89.7% (95% CI: 76.4%-95.9%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-98.8%) for IgA, and of 48.7% (95% CI: 33.9%-63.8%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-99.8%) for IgM. With the Platelia system, the specificity and sensitivity were 97.4% (95% CI: 92.1%-99.7%) and 94.9% (95% CI: 87.7%-98.0%) for total antibodies using the adapted cut-offs. The NovaLisa and the Platelia tests have satisfactory analytical performances.

Understanding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral clearance profile is crucial to establish a re-testing plan on discharge and ending isolation of patients. We aimed to evaluate the number of days that a patient needed to achieve undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab and/or an oropharyngeal swab). The clearance and persistence of viral RNA was evaluated in two groups of positive patients: those who achieved two negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and those who kept testing positive. Patients were organized thereafter in two subgroups, mild illness patients discharged home and inpatients who had moderate to severe illness. Results from RT-PCR tests were then correlated with results from the evaluation of the immune response. The study evidenced that most patients tested positive for more than 2 weeks and that persistence of viral RNA is not necessarily associated with severe disease but may result from a weaker immune response instead. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","clearance; COVID-19; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2",,"32484958","J.

Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-Cov-2]) nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false-negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. © 2020 The Authors.

The World Health Organization officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the global spread of COVID-19, similar cases have appeared in other areas of China, and there are a few reports of pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY A 7-year-old girl was diagnosed with COVID-19 and presented with irregular fever, sore throat and diarrhea. Chest computed tomography revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities in multiple areas. The lesions were mainly distributed in the bronchial bundles or subpleural areas of both lungs, particularly in the right lower lobe. The patient also presented with diarrhea, mild kidney injury, and live coronavirus was found in her feces. She was given antiviral agents (lopinavir and ritonavir), and follow-up detection showed that these abnormalities were markedly decreased within 3 d. CONCLUSION The clinical symptoms and prognosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients may be different from those in adult patients, and the fecal-oral transmission of SARSCoV-2 should be considered. © The Author(s) 2020.","Case report; Computed tomographic; COVID-19; Fecaloral transmission; Pediatric patient; SARS-CoV-2","C reactive protein; lopinavir; ritonavir; Article; blood cell count; case report; chemoembolization; child; childhood disease; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; fever; follow up; gastrointestinal motility; hemodialysis; hospitalization; human; leukocyte count; mesenchymal stem cell; myotomy; neutrophil; outcome assessment; palliative therapy; pneumonia; prospective study; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; segmentectomy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; thorax radiography; urea nitrogen blood level",,"World J.

Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum. When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively. This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra- and inter-assay analyses respectively. Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of specimen pooling for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten previously tested nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens by real-time PCR, were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimens of varying viral concentrations. Specimen pooling did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2 when the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of original specimen was lower than 35. In specimens with low viral load (Ct>35), 2 out of 15 pools (13.3%) were false negative. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence (≤1%) areas or in low risk populations can dramatically decrease the resource burden on laboratory operations by up to 80%. This paves the way for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with a low incidence of infection, or with lower risk populations.

Methods: A total of 535 COVID-19 patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, chronic eye diseases, systemic concomitant symptoms, radiologic findings and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by real-time PCR was collected from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: Of 535 patients, 27 patients (5.0%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 4 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 5.9 ± 4.5 days (mean [SD]). The other ocular symptoms, including increased conjunctival secretion, ocular pain, photophobia, dry eye and tearing, were also found in patients with conjunctival congestion. Notably, hand–eye contact was independently correlated with conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had chronic eye diseases, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.2%), xerophthalmia (24, 4.5%) and keratitis (14, 2.6%). Similar to the published studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough and fatigue. A total of 343 patients (64.1%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion is one of the COVID-19-related ocular symptoms, which could occur as the initial symptoms. Frequent hand–eye contact may be the risk factor for conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients. Screening of patients with conjunctival congestion by ophthalmologists is advocated during the outbreak of COVID-19. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection. © 2020 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection. Issue: How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies? Methods: Calculation of the probability that, depending on the pretest probability (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and test properties, antibodies are present or absent in the case of positive or negative test results. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS-CoV-2 AB test systems vary between 53 % and 94 % and between 91 % and 99.5 %, respectively. When using a test with high test quality, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 42 % and 7 9%, respectively, with a pre-test probability of 1 % to 5 %, as can currently be assumed for the general population in Austria or Germany. For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably. The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %. Conclusions: A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems. Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low. Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons. © 2020","Antibody; Negative predictive value; Positive predictive value; Pre-test probability; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Z.

Currently the potential extra-respiratory transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Methods: Using single-cell RNA Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets and immunohistochemical analysis, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 tropism in the embryonic, fetal and adult human ocular surface. Results: The co-expression of ACE2 receptor and entry protease TMPRSS2 was detected in the human adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium, but not in the embryonic and fetal ocular surface up to 21 post conception weeks. These expression patterns were corroborated by the single cell ATAC-Seq data, which revealed a permissive chromatin in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 loci in the adult conjunctival, limbal and corneal epithelium. Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was strongly detected in the superficial limbal, corneal and conjunctival epithelium, implicating these as target entry cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular surface. Strikingly, we also identified the key pro-inflammatory signals TNF, NFKβ and IFNG as upstream regulators of the transcriptional profile of ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in the superficial conjunctival epithelium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilise inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression to enhance infection in ocular surface. Conclusions: Together our data indicate that the human ocular surface epithelium provides an additional entry portal for SARS-CoV-2, which may exploit inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry factors to enhance infection. © 2020","ace2; Conjunctiva; Cornea; sars-cov-2; tmprss2",,"32502616","Ocul.

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out including patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 3 hospitals, health workers exposed to the infection and outpatients who met suspicious case criteria, all of which underwent the molecular test (RT-PCR) and the rapid serological test. The additional diagnostic performance of rapid serological test was evaluated in comparison to molecular tests. Likewise, an approximation was made to the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid serological test. Results: 144 people were included. With the rapid test, 19.4% of positive results were obtained compared to 11.1% in the molecular test (p = 0.03). The rapid serological test detected 21 cases that had been negative by the initial (RT-PCR), providing an additional diagnostic performance of 56.8% compared to the RT-PCR. The additional diagnostic performance was 50.0% during the first week, 70.0% during the second week and 50.0% during the third week of symptom onset. The sensitivity of the rapid serological test was 43.8% and the specificity of 98.9%. Conclusions: The rapid serological test was able to detect a greater number of cases than those detected by the molecular test especially after the second week of onset of symptoms. It also showed high specificity. It is therefore useful as a complementary test to RT-PCR, especially during the second and third week of illness. © 2020, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for medical and public health reasons, to allow the best treatment of cases and the best control of the pandemic. Serology testing allows for the detection of asymptomatic infections and 19-COVID cases once the virus has been cleared. We analyzed the usefulness of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test of Autobio and tried to correlate its pattern with the severity of COVID19 infection. Material and methods. We analyzed the accuracy and clinical usefulness of a point-of-care IgM and/or IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 in 35 COVID-19 patients [12 (34.3%) mild-moderate and 23 (65.7%) severe-critical] admitted to a field hospital in Madrid, as well as in 5 controls. Results. The mean time from the first day of symptoms to the antibody test was 28 days (SD: 8.7), similar according to the severity of the disease. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ showed the corresponding IgG positivity, while these results were negative in all control individuals. A total of 26 (74%) cases also presented with positive IgM, 19 (83%) were severe-critical cases and 7 (58%) were mild-moderate cases. The IgM response lasted longer in the severe critical cases (mean: 29.7 days; SD: 8.4) compared to the moderate cases (mean: 21.2 days; SD: 2.0). Conclusions. Rapid serology tests are useful for the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 (mainly IgG detection) and may also be correlated with the severity of the infection (based on IgM detection). © The Author 2020.

The increasing number of employees on sick-leave due to COVID-19 creates severe logistic problems. Some elderly care homes therefore started to screen their personnel to secure the safety of the elderly and to avoid unnecessary quarantine of potentially immune employees. Secondary data from a screening with a COVID-19 rapid test for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG of 1,500 employees in 22 elderly care homes in Stockholm, Sweden, were analyzed. Seropositive employees were found in 21 out of the 22 care homes. In total, 23% (231/1,005) of the employees tested positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 14.3% (144/1,005) were found positive for IgM (either alone or combined with IgG), indicating recent or present infection. Of those that tested seropositive, 46.5% did not report any clinical symptoms, indicating pre- or asymptomatic infections. Reported symptoms with the highest correlation with seropositivity were fever and loss of smell and taste. These results suggest that antibody testing of employees in elderly care homes is valuable for surveillance of disease development and a crucial screening tool in the effort to decrease the death toll in this pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).

Some viruses have neuroinvasive properties and activate the immune response in the brain. These immune events may be neuroprotective or they may cause long-term damage similar to what is seen in some neurodegenerative diseases. The new “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the Respiratory viruses causing highly acute lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical similarities to those reported in “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus”(SARS-CoV) and the “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus”(MERS-CoV) including neurological manifestation. To examine the possible neurological damage induced by SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to understand the immune reactions to viral infection in the brain, and their short- and long-term consequences. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which will be discussed, cooperative homological and phylogenetical studies lead us to question if SARS-CoV-2 can have similar neuroinvasive capacities and neuroinflammatiory events that may lead to the same short- and long-term neuropathologies that SARS-CoV had shown in human and animal models. To explain the neurological manifestation caused by SARS-CoV-2, we will present a literature review of 765 COVID-19 patients, in which 18% had neurological symptoms and complications, including encephalopathy, encephalitis and cerebrovascular pathologies, acute myelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Clinical studies describe anosmia or partial loss of the sense of smell as the most frequent symptom in COVID19 patients, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction and the initial ultrarapid immune responses could be a prognostic factor. © 2020, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.","Acute and chronic neurological diseases; CNS infection; COVID-19; Encephalitis; Encephalopathy; Human coronavirus; Human respiratory virus; Neuroinvasion; Respiratory viral infection",,,"Neurol.

Sensitivity of RT-PCR nasopharyngeal (NP) testing is presumed to be high, but there is no gold standard against which this has been determined. The objective was to determine whether lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), occurs in the absence of upper respiratory tract infection with clinical testing of both specimen types. Methods: Between March 26, 2020 and April 17, 2020 at the University of Washington Medical Center all patients with BALF specimens clinically tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. We assessed the proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in BALF after negative NP testing. We describe 3 cases with positive testing in BALF. Results: Among 16 patients with BALF samples, 3 cases (19%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in BALF. In Case 1, negative NP testing occurred early in the infection and respiratory symptoms may have been missed due to neurologic injury. In Case 2, outpatient diagnosis was aspiration pneumonia, but clinical suspicion remained high for COVID-19 at hospitalization based on epidemiological and clinical features. All 3 cases involved older adults (age >65 years), one of whom was immunosuppressed in the setting of lung transplantation (Case 3). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 LRTI occurs in the presence of negative NP testing. NP testing may underestimate the prevalence of COVID-19 and has implications for spread of SARS-CoV2 in the community and healthcare setting. © 2020 The Authors",,"acute graft rejection; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; aspiration pneumonia; brain death; brain hemorrhage; brain hernia; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; bronchoscopy; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; female; fever; human; limit of detection; lung injury; lung transplantation; male; nasopharyngeal testing; priority journal; respiratory failure; respiratory tract examination; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; thorax radiography; transbronchial biopsy; ventilator associated pneumonia; very elderly; virus load",,"Respir.

What the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) means for the transplant cohort is a question that, as of now, cannot easily be answered. Data on prevalence, relevance of the novel virus, and clinical course of the infection in stable LT patients are limited. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were performed in our outpatient department during the shutdown between March and April 2020 in Germany. Results: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 3%. Three out of a cohort of 101 LT patients were asymptomatic for respiratory diseases. Respiratory complaints were common and not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall monthly mortality rate was 0.22% and did not show alterations during the shutdown in Germany. Conclusions: If preventive measures are applied, LT patients do not seem to be at a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Telemedicine in the outpatient setting may help to maintain distance and to reduce direct patient contact. However, standard of care must be guaranteed for patients with relevant comorbidities in spite of pandemics, because complications may arise from preexisting conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

It was named COVID-19, and to date, thousands of cases of infection and death are reported worldwide. This disease is associated with a wide range of symptoms, which makes accurate diagnosis of it difficult. During previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, researchers found that the patients with fever, cough, or sore throat had a 5% influenza virus-positive rate. This finding made us think that the wide range of symptoms and also relatively high prevalence of death in our patients may be due to the coinfection with other viruses. Thus, we evaluated the coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other respiratory viruses in dead patients in North Khorasan. We evaluated the presence of influenza A/B virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses in 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive dead patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR tests. We found coinfection with influenza virus in 22.3%, RSV, and bocavirus in 9.7%, parainfluenza viruses in 3.9%, human metapneumovirus in 2.9%, and finally adenovirus in 1.9% of SARS-CoV-2 positive dead cases. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of coinfection with influenza A virus and the monopoly of coinfection with Human metapneumovirus in children. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","adenovirus; bocavirus; coinfection; human metapneumovirus; influenza virus; parainfluenza virus; respiratory syncytial virus; SARS-Cov-2",,"32720703","J.

One of the main functions of gastric juice is to inactivate swallowed microorganisms, thereby inhibiting infectious agents from reaching the intestine. Studies have documented that proton pump inhibitors are a risk factor for rotavirus, influenza virus, norovirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections, and are associated with an increased risk of acute gastroenteritis during periods of highest circulation of enteric viruses. In light of the evidence for gastrointestinal infection implying a fecal–oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and given the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, associated with the widespread misuse of proton pump inhibitors, this suggests that we should not rule out the hypothesis that patients treated with proton pump inhibitors may be more at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,"Clin.

There is an incomplete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and transmission potential at this time and the resultant anxiety has led to variable breastfeeding recommendations for suspected or confirmed mothers with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to the potential concern for transmission of infection from maternal respiratory secretions to the newborn, temporary separation of the maternal-baby dyad, allowing for expressed breast milk to be fed to the infant, was initially recommended but later revised to include breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics in contrast to international societies, which recommend direct breastfeeding. This separation can have negative health and emotional implications for both mother and baby. Only two publications have reported SARS-CoV-2 in human breast milk but the role of breast milk as a vehicle of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborns still remains unclear and may indeed be providing protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection even in infected neonates. Other modes of transmission of infection to neonates from infected mothers or any care providers cannot be overemphasized. Symptomatic mothers on hydroxychloroquine can safely breastfeed and no adverse effects were reported in a baby treated with remdesivir in another drug trial. The excretion of sarilumab in human breast milk is unknown at this time. Hence, given the overall safety of breast milk and both short-term and long- term nutritional, immunological, and developmental advantages of breast milk to newborn, breast milk should not be withheld from baby. The setting of maternal care, severity of maternal infection and availability of resources can impact the decision of breastfeeding, the role of shared decision making on breastfeeding between mother and physician needs to be emphasized. We strongly recommend direct breastfeeding with appropriate hygiene precautions unless the maternal or neonatal health condition warrants separation of this dyad. Key Points Breastmilk does not appear to play a significant role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Mother-baby separation has negative health and emotional consequences. Mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can directly breastfeed with appropriate precautions. © 2020 American Medical Association.

One possible strategy is the repurposing of existing drugs approved for other indications as antiviral agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the commercial unavailability of SARS-CoV-2 drugs for treating COVID-19, we screened approximately 250 existing drugs or pharmacologically active compounds for their inhibitory activities against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), a human coronavirus in the same genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV-2. Methods: FIPV was proliferated in feline Fcwf-4 cells and HCoV-OC43 in human HCT-8 cells. Viral proliferation was assayed by visualization of cytopathic effects on the infected Fcwf-4 cells and immunofluorescent assay for detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-OC43 in the HCT-8 cells. The concentrations (EC50) of each drug necessary to diminish viral activity to 50% of that for the untreated controls were determined. The viabilities of Fcwf-4 and HCT-8 cells were measured by crystal violet staining and MTS/PMS assay, respectively. Results: Fifteen out of the 252 drugs or pharmacologically active compounds screened were found to be active against both FIPV and HCoV-OC43, with EC50 values ranging from 11 nM to 75 μM. They are all old drugs as follows, anisomycin, antimycin A, atovaquone, chloroquine, conivaptan, emetine, gemcitabine, homoharringtonine, niclosamide, nitazoxanide, oligomycin, salinomycin, tilorone, valinomycin, and vismodegib. Conclusion: All of the old drugs identified as having activity against FIPV and HCoV-OC43 have seen clinical use in their respective indications and are associated with known dosing schedules and adverse effect or toxicity profiles in humans. Those, when later confirmed to have an anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, should be considered for immediate uses in COVID-19 patients. © 2020 Chang Gung University","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cytopathic effect; Drug repurpose; HCoV-OC43; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Biomed.

We performed culture and full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains followed by phylogenetic analysis. A 382-nucleotides deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was found in a Taiwanese strain isolated from a patient on February 4, 2020 who had a travel history to Wuhan. Patients in the first wave also included several sporadic, local transmission cases. Genomes of 5 strains sequenced from clustered infections were classified into a new clade with ORF1ab-V378I mutation, in addition to 3 dominant clades ORF8-L84S, ORF3a-G251V and S-D614G. This highlighted clade also included some strains isolated from patients who had a travel history to Turkey and Iran. The second wave mostly resulted from patients who had a travel history to Europe and Americas. All Taiwanese viruses were classified into various clades. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan revealed a new ORF8-deletion mutant and a virus clade that may be associated with infections in the Middle East, which contributed to a better understanding of the global SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The objective of this paper was to explore the contributions of three transmission routes—contact, droplet, and inhalation—to the risk of occupationally acquired COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel (HCP). The method was quantitative microbial risk assessment, and an exposure model, where possible model parameters were based on data specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus when available. The key finding was that droplet and inhalation transmission routes predominate over the contact route, contributing 35%, 57%, and 8.2% of the probability of infection, on average, without use of personal protective equipment. On average, 80% of inhalation exposure occurs when HCP are near patients. The relative contribution of droplet and inhalation depends upon the emission of SARS-CoV-2 in respirable particles (&lt;10 µm) through exhaled breath, and inhalation becomes predominant, on average, when emission exceeds five gene copies per min. The predicted concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of the patient room is low (&lt; 1 gene copy per m3 on average), and likely below the limit of quantification for many air sampling methods. The findings demonstrate the value of respiratory protection for HCP, and that field sampling may not be sensitive enough to verify the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 inhalation to the risk of occupationally acquired COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel. The emission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory droplets of different sizes is a critical knowledge gap for understanding and controlling COVID-19 transmission. © 2020, © 2020 JOEH, LLC.","exposure modeling; personal protective equipment; quantitative microbial risk assessment; Respiratory protection; viral aerosol",,,"J.

Their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory examination data and imaging characteristics were analyzed. Risk factors for false negatives were discussed. Compared with the nucleic acid positive group, the false-negative group had less epidemiological exposure (52.6% vs 83.9%; P =.025), less chest discomfort (5.3% vs 32.3%; P =.035), and faster recovery (10 [8, 13] vs 15 [11, 18.5] days; P =.005).

Methods: We conducted a survey of Spaniard healthcare professionals who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and presented headache during the course of the disease. The survey addressed respondents’ medical history and headache characteristics, and we analyzed the association between both. Results: We analyzed the responses of a sample of 112 healthcare professionals. History of migraine was reported by 20/112 (17.9%) of respondents, history of tension-type headache by 8/112 (7.1%), and history of cluster headache was reported by a single respondent; 82/112(73.2%) of respondents had no history of headache.

Because the characteristics of the headache and the associated symptoms are heterogeneous in our survey, we suggest that several patterns with specific pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie the headache associated with COVID-19. © 2020 American Headache Society","COVID-19; headache; healthcare professionals; migraine; neurological symptoms; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Headache",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087913592

However, little is known about the impact of ethnicity and household size on acquiring infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We undertook a retrospective cohort study, in Leicester (UK), of all individuals assessed for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust between 1st March and 28th April 2020. We used logistic regression to identify sociodemographic, clinical and temporal factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity before/after lockdown. Findings: 971/4051 (24.0%) patients with suspected COVID-19 were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. PCR positivity was more common amongst individuals from ethnic minortiy backgrounds than their White counterparts (White 20.0%, South Asian 37.5%, Black 36.1%, Other 32.2%; p<0.001 for all ethnic minority groups vs White). After adjustment, compared to White ethnicity, South Asian (aOR 2.44 95%CI 2.01, 2.97), Black (aOR 2.56 95%CI 1.71, 3.84) and Other (aOR 2.53 95%CI 1.74, 3.70) ethnicities were more likely to test positive, as were those with a larger estimated household size (aOR 1.06 95%CI 1.02, 1.11). We saw increasing proportions of positive tests in the three weeks post-lockdown amongst the ethnic minority, but not the White, cohort. Estimated household size was associated with PCR positivity after, but not before, lockdown (aOR 1.10 95%CI 1.03, 1.16). Interpretation: In individuals presenting with suspected COVID-19, those from ethnic minority communities and larger households had an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Pandemic control measures may have more rapid impact on slowing viral transmission amongst those of White ethnicity compared to ethnic minority groups, Research is urgently required to understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities and whether public health interventions have differential effects on individuals from ethnic minority groups.

Although the diagnostics of acute patients by RT-PCR is both efficient and specific, we are also crucially in need of serological tools for investigating antibody responses and assessing individual and potential herd immunity. We evaluated a commercially available test developed for rapid (within 15 minutes) detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by 29 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 124 negative controls. The results revealed a sensitivity of 69% and 93.1% for IgM and IgG, respectively, based solely on PCR-positivity due to the absence of a serological gold standard. The assay specificities were shown to be 100% for IgM and 99.2% for IgG. This indicates that the test is suitable for assessing previous virus exposure, although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection. More detailed studies on antibody responses during and post infection are urgently needed. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

With the recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control. Hence, we have developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a detection limit of 102 RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR. Notably, the assay has exhibited a rapid detection span of 30 min combined with the colorimetric visualization. This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV). Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. In addition to the high sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory capacities. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Method: We collected week-case data of severe influenza, invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease and death toll from pneumonia among 25 calendar weeks of the influenza season for four years (2016–2020), which were reported to Taiwan CDC. Trend and slope differences between years were compared. Result: A downturn trend of severe influenza, invasive S. pneumoniae disease and the death toll from pneumonia per week in 2019/2020 season and significant trend difference in comparison to previous seasons were noted, especially after initiation of several disease prevention measures to fight potential COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan.

Furthermore, viral loads detected on both throat and anal swabs also showed no significant difference (P = 0.9511) and correlation (Pearson r = 0.0434, P = 0.8406), and exhibited an inconsistent kinetic change through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, viral loads in the throat and anal swabs were correlated with different types of immune states, immune-reactive phase, and the resolution phase/immunologic tolerance, respectively. These findings revealed that RT-PCR-testing on throat and anal swabs showed significant difference for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlated with different immune state in paediatric patients. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed and Scopus (April 2020). Studies reporting data on sensitivity or specificity of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 using any human biological sample were included. Results: Sixteen studies were evaluated. Meta-analysis showed that computed tomography has high sensitivity (91.9% [89.8%-93.7%]), but low specificity (25.1% [21.0%-29.5%]). The combination of IgM and IgG antibodies demonstrated promising results for both parameters (84.5% [82.2%-86.6%]; 91.6% [86.0%-95.4%], respectively). For RT-PCR tests, rectal stools/swab, urine, and plasma were less sensitive while sputum (97.2% [90.3%-99.7%]) presented higher sensitivity for detecting the virus. Conclusions: RT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in sputum samples.

Robust proof of placental infection requires demonstration of viral localization within placental tissue. Only two of the few cases of possible vertical transmission have demonstrated placental infection. None have shown placental expression of the ACE2 or TMPRSS2 protein, both required for viral infection. We examined 19 COVID-19 exposed placentas for histopathologic findings, and for expression of ACE2, and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry. Direct placental SARS-CoV-2 expression was studied by two methods—nucleocapsid protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and RNA expression by in situ hybridization. ACE2 membranous expression in the syncytiotrophoblast (ST) of the chorionic villi is predominantly in a polarized pattern with expression highest on the stromal side of the ST. In addition, cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast express ACE2. No ACE2 expression was detected in villous stroma, Hofbauer cells, or endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 expression was only present weakly in the villous endothelium and rarely in the ST. In 2 of 19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the placenta focally in the ST and cytotrophoblast. There was no characteristic histopathology present in our cases including the two placental infections. We found that the placenta is capable of being infected but that this event is rare. We propose one explanation could be the polarized expression of ACE2 away from the maternal blood and pronounced paucity of TMPRSS2 expression in trophoblast. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.",,,,"Mod.

In the active phase of a pandemic, early results allow these preventive measures to be implemented on a scale compatible with the pandemic. If the results are convincing, their value will be difficult to overestimate, since additional one or two outbreaks of this infection are expected. Clinical data is emerging rapidly from a large number of people afflicted with SARS-CoV-2, which should provide clinicians with accurate evidence of the effectiveness of different preventive and treatment methods. In particular, an active search is underway for cellular mechanisms that SARS-CoV-2 uses to penetrate tissues. These include information about the receptor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (ACE 2). SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded envelope RNA virus, attaches to cells via a viral spike (S) protein that binds to the ACE 2. After binding to the receptor, the viral particle uses the receptors of the host cell and endosomes to enter the cells. Human type transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS 2) facilitates penetration into the cell via protein S. Once inside the cell, viral polyproteins are synthesized that encode the replicate transcriptase complex. The virus then synthesizes RNA through its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Structural proteins are synthesized leading to the completion of the assembly and release of viral particles. These stages of the virus life cycle provide potential targets for drug therapy. Current clinical and scientific data do not support discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19, and an ongoing discussion is addressed in this review. © 2020 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League.

To quickly identify the pathogen, we designed and screened primer sets, and established a sensitive and specific qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV 2; the lower limit of detection (LOD) was 14.8 (95% CI: 9.8–21) copies per reaction. We combined this qRT-PCR assay with an automatic integration system for nucleic acid extraction and amplification, thereby establishing an automatic integrated gene detection system (AIGS) for SARS-CoV 2. Cross reactive analysis performed in 20 other respiratory viruses and 37 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% specificity of the assay. Using two fold diluted SARS-CoV 2 culture, the LOD of AIGS was confirmed to be 365 copies/ml (95% CI: 351–375), which was Comparable to that of conventional q RT–PCR (740 copies/ml, 95% CI: 689–750). Clinical performances of AIGS assay were assessed in 266 suspected COVID-19 clinical respiratory tract samples tested in parallel with a commercial kit. The clinical sensitivity of the AIGS test was 97.62% (95% CI: 0.9320–0.9951) based on the commercial kit test result, and concordance analysis showed a high agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection between the two assays, Pearson R was 0.9623 (95% CI: 0.9523–0.9703). The results indicated that this AIGS could be used for rapid detection of SARS-CoV 2. With the advantage of simple operation and less time consuming, AIGS could be suitable for SARS-CoV2 detection in primary medical institutions, thus would do a great help to improve detection efficiency and control the spread of COVID-19. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

While PCR remains the frontline test of choice in the acute diagnostic setting, serological tests are urgently needed. Unlike PCR tests which are highly specific, cross-reactivity is a major challenge for COVID-19 antibody tests considering there are six other coronaviruses known to infect humans. SARS-CoV is genetically related to SARS-CoV-2 sharing approximately 80% sequence identity and both belong to the species SARS related coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus of family Coronaviridae. We developed and compared the performance of four different serological tests to comprehensively assess the cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and SARS patient sera. There is significant cross-reactivity when N protein of either virus is used. The S1 or RBD regions from the spike (S) protein offers better specificity. Amongst the different platforms, capture ELISA performed best. We found that SARS survivors all have significant levels of antibodies remaining in their blood 17 years after infection. Anti-N antibodies waned more than anti-RBD antibodies, and the latter is known to play a more important role in providing protective immunity. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

However, due to the low viral load specimens and the limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which results in failure to timely diagnose, cut off transmission, and assess discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 77 patients, and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up survey. 26 patients of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR reports were reported as positive by ddPCR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27–55%), 100% (95% CI: 54–100%), 100%, 16% (95% CI: 13–19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48–0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33–60%) for RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83–99%), 100% (95% CI: 48–100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36–83%), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02–0.18), and 95% (95% CI: 84–99%) for ddPCR, respectively. Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR at 5–12 days post discharge. Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the RT-PCR. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Additionally, this study sought to determine whether odor threshold testing provided additional information on olfactory loss due to COVID-19 compared to the more common odor identification testing. Methods: Prospective cohort study of patients with sudden chemosensory loss since February 2020 and confirmed COVID-19 infection via RT-PCR or serology testing. Olfactory function was tested extensively using the “Sniffin Sticks” test battery. In addition, we screened gustatory perception and nasal cooling sensations using psychophysical tests. Results: Seventy-two patients completed the study. After a mean of 37 days, 37% of patients showed olfactory dysfunction, 7% were dysgeusic, and 48% showed signs of low sensitivity for cooling sensation. A longer duration of anosmia before smell improvement was correlated with lower olfactory function at 5 weeks. Odor threshold detection was more affected by COVID-19 compared to odor identification. Conclusion: Five weeks after developing sudden chemosensory loss due to COVID-19, a high proportion of patients were dysosmic and showed signs of low nasal cooling sensitivity, whereas most of them had normal taste function. SARS-CoV-2 affected mainly odor thresholds, possibly suggesting that the major cause of loss of smell lies at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium, rather than in the central nervous system. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chemosensory loss; COVID-19; Psychophysical test; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Eur.

This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to-patient transmission among health professionals in maternity units. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK, and to determine associations between healthcare workers’ characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. Five out of 40 (12.5%; 95%CI 4.2–26.8%) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95%CI 5.6–25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95%CI 9.5–24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95%CI 9.9–20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (21%) and 10/29 (35%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (52%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95%CI 6–55). Of those who were seropositive, 59% had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This is the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that one out of six were seropositive, of whom one out of three were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity units.

In all patients, data on the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were analyzed by reviewing all RNA detection results during hospitalization. In addition, demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, and outcome data were also collected from electronic medical records. Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding were analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. Among 181 patients, the mean age was 44.3 ± 13.2 years, and 55.2% were male. The median duration of viral shedding from illness onset was 18.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 15.0-24.0). Prolonged viral shedding was associated with longer hospital stays (P <.001) and higher medical costs (P <.001). The severity of COVID-19 had nothing to do with prolonged shedding. Moreover, the median time from onset to antiviral treatment initiation was 5.0 days (IQR, 3.0-7.0). Delayed antiviral treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.976; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.962-0.990]) and lopinavir/ritonavir + interferon-α (IFN-α) combination therapy as the initial antiviral treatment (HR 1.649; 95% CI, 1.162-2.339) were independent factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. SARS-CoV-2 showed prolonged viral shedding, causing increased hospital stays and medical costs.

Concerns over high severe acute respiratory syndrome‒coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral burden of mucosal surfaces has raised questions about the aerosol-generating potential and dangers of many otorhinolaryngologic procedures. However, the risks of aerosol generation and associated viral transmission by droplet or airborne routes for many otorhinolaryngology procedures are largely unknown. Indoor aerosol and droplet viral respiratory transmission risk is influenced by 4 factors: (1) aerosol or droplet properties; (2) indoor airflow; (3) virus-specific factors; and (4) host-specific factors. Herein we elaborate on known aerosol vs droplet properties, indoor airflow, and aerosol-generating events to provide context for risks of aerosol infectious transmission. We also provide simple but typically effective measures for mitigating the spread and inhalation of viral aerosols in indoor settings. Understanding principles of infectious transmission, aerosol and droplet generation, as well as concepts of indoor airflow, will assist in the integration of new data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and activities that can generate aerosol to best inform on the need for escalation or de-escalation from current societal and institutional guidelines for protection during aerosol-generating procedures. © 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC","aerosol; aerosol-generating procedure; airborne; COVID-19; droplet; SARS-CoV-2",,"32652898","Int.

In this study, chemiluminescence detection of IgM antibody showed a positive conversion earlier (about 1~2 days earlier), positive conversion rates higher in different stages of disease, and a trend of declining positive rate later than colloidal gold method. For IgG antibody, the chemiluminescence method showed a positive conversion earlier and the positive rate climbing more quickly than the colloidal gold method. No obvious negative-converting tendency of IgG detection was observed within 35 days after the onset of disease. Although colloidal gold method is generally less sensitive than chemiluminescence method, it shows advantages of shorter turn-around time, more simple procedure and no special equipment required.

As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. Conclusion: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply. © 2020 AABB",,,,"Transfusion",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087844215

Results: Several loopholes have been identified in the infection control and prevention practices against COVID-19 of the 2 radiology departments. Loopholes were in large part due to our limited understanding of the highly contagious coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is characterized by features not observed in other SARS viruses.

We aimed to assess in this group the attack rate of asymptomatic carriers and the symptoms most frequently associated with infection. Methods: Occupational and clinical characteristics of HCWs who underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a university hospital from 24 February 2020 to 31 March 2020 were collected. For those who tested positive and for those who tested positive but who were asymptomatic, we checked the laboratory and clinical data as of 22 May to calculate the time necessary for HCWs to then test negative and to verify whether symptoms developed thereafter. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: There were 139 positive tests (8.8%) among 1573 HCWs (95% confidence interval, 7.5–10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (122/503, 24.2%) and asymptomatic (17/1070, 1.6%) workers (p < 0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (61/582, 10.5%), whereas clerical workers and technicians had the lowest frequency (5/137, 3.6%). The likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 increased with the number of reported symptoms; the strongest predictors of test positivity were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio = 76.9) and fever (odds ratio = 9.12). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 27 days (95% confidence interval, 24–30). Conclusions: HCWs can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 without displaying any symptoms. Among symptomatic HCWs, the key symptoms to guide diagnosis are taste and smell alterations and fever. A median of almost 4 weeks is necessary before nasopharyngeal swab test results are negative. © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","COVID-19; Healthcare operators; Nasopharyngeal swab; Nosocomial transmission; SARS-CoV-2",,"32569835","Clin.

Staff were tested for COVID-19 by obtaining oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal specimens, with RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2.RESULTSTwo separate index patients were admitted in February and March 2020, without initial suspicion for COVID-19 and without contact or droplet precautions in place; both patients underwent several aerosol generating procedures in this context. A total of 421 health care workers were exposed in total, and the results of the case contact investigations identified 8 secondary infections in health care workers. In all 8 cases, the staff had close contact with the index patients without sufficient personal protective equipment. Importantly, despite multiple aerosol generating procedures, there was no evidence of airborne transmission.CONCLUSIONThese observations suggest that, at least in a healthcare setting, a majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to take place during close contact with infected patients through respiratory droplets, rather than by long-distance airborne transmission. © 2020 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

The identification of paucisymptomatic patients is paramount in order to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Olfactory loss could be one of those early symptoms which might help in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aim to develop and validate a fast, inexpensive, reliable and easy-to-perform olfactory test for the screening of suspected COVID-19 patients. Study design: Phase I was a case–control study and Phase II a transversal descriptive study. Subjects and methods: Olfaction was assessed with the ethyl alcohol threshold test and symptoms with visual analogue scales. The study was designed in two phases: In Phase I, we compared confirmed COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. In Phase II, patients with suspected COVID-19 infection referred for testing were studied. Results: 275 participants were included in Phase I, 135 in Phase II. The ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.749 in Phase I, 0.737 in Phase II. The cutoff value which offered the highest amount of correctly classified patients was ≥ 2 (10% alcohol) for all age intervals. The odds ratio was 8.19 in Phase I, 6.56 in Phase II with a 75% sensitivity. When cases report normal sense of smell (VAS < 4), it misdiagnoses 57.89% of patients detected by the alcohol threshold test. Conclusion: The olfactory loss assessed with the alcohol threshold test has shown high sensitivity and odds ratio in both patients with confirmed COVID-19 illness and participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Olfaction; Olfactory impairment; SARS-CoV-2; Sniff test",,,"Eur.

In our study, we did a retrospective review of medical records from COVID-19 patients admitted to one ward of Tongji Hospital of Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology from 10 February to 13 April 2020. From 10 February to 13 April 2020, there were 108 patients of COVID-19 admitted in the one ward of Tongji Hospital.

On the second admission, they had no symptoms and their chest computed tomography was almost normal. Data from laboratory tests of the readmission patients showed that all eight patients had normal white blood cell count, lymphocyte count. The inflammatory factors like procalcitonin and interleukin 6 were normal. After treatment, two patients met the standard and were discharged. The other six patients were still in the hospital because their RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 did not get three consecutive negative results and the course of two patients had persisted more than 90 days.

Mask-wearing and handwashing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently, masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely handwashing is often impossible. In this study, the efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using the avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Previous studies on mask-wearing were reviewed. The results showed that instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of four-layer kitchen paper and one-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols. Medical mask-wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data, we propose the approach of mask-wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19. Collectively, a simple approach to slow the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 was proposed with the support of experiments, literature review, and control experiences. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","coronavirus; COVID-19; hand hygiene; mask; pandemic; soap",,"32232986","J.

We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers. Methods: We did a cross-sectional study at three of the nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands. We screened health-care workers at the participating hospitals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on clinical symptoms (fever or mild respiratory symptoms) in the 10 days before screening. We obtained epidemiological data through structured interviews with health-care workers and combined this information with data from whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples taken from health-care workers and patients. We did an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and patients. Findings: Between March 2 and March 12, 2020, 1796 (15%) of 12 022 health-care workers were screened, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We obtained complete and near-complete genome sequences from 50 health-care workers and ten patients. Most sequences were grouped in three clusters, with two clusters showing local circulation within the region. The noted patterns were consistent with multiple introductions into the hospitals through community-acquired infections and local amplification in the community. Interpretation: Although direct transmission in the hospitals cannot be ruled out, our data do not support widespread nosocomial transmission as the source of infection in patients or health-care workers.

Studies have detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in saliva with a viral load that lasts for a long period. However, researchers are yet to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly enter the salivary glands. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/transmembrane serine proteases 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in salivary glands using publicly available databases. The distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSSs family in salivary gland tissue and other tissues was analyzed. The Genotype-Tissue Expression dataset was employed to explore the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in various body organs and salivary glands in a healthy population. The single-cell sequencing data for salivary gland samples (including submandibular salivary gland and parotid gland) from mice were collected and analyzed. The components and proportions of salivary gland cells expressing the key protease TMPRSSs family were analyzed. Transcriptome data analysis showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in salivary glands. The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were marginal without significant differences in different age groups or between men and women. Single-cell RNA sequence analysis indicated that TMPRSS2 was mainly expressed in salivary gland epithelial cells.

We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network. Methods: We analysed routinely collected, pseudonymised data for patients in the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre primary care sentinel network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network. Findings: We identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18·4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13·3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·27–1·89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40–64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18·5%] of 1316 adults aged 40–64 years vs 23 [4·6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5·36, 95% CI 3·28–8·76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15·5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62·1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4·75, 95% CI 2·65–8·51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26·2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5·6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4·59, 95% CI 3·57–5·90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29·5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7·7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2·03, 95% CI 1·51–2·71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32·9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14·4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1·91, 95% CI 1·31–2·78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20·9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13·2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1·41, 95% CI 1·04–1·91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11·4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17·9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0·49, 95% CI 0·34–0·71). Interpretation: A positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.

Molecular diagnosis of the disease is typically performed via nucleic acid-based detection of the virus from swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, the positive rate from the commonly used specimens (swabs or sputum) was less than 75%. Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are needed to accurately diagnose COVID-19. Sera were collected from patients or healthy people in a local hospital in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, China. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were then detected using a SARS-CoV-2 IgM colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). Results were analysed in combination with sera collection date and clinical information. The GICA was found to be positive with the detected 82.2% (37/45) of RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as 32.0% (8/25) of clinically confirmed, RT-qPCR negative patients (4–14 days after symptom onset). Investigation of IgM-negative, RT-qPCR-positive COVID-19 patients showed that half of them developed severe disease. The GICA was found to be a useful test to complement existing PCR-based assays for confirmation of COVID-19, and a delayed specific IgM antibody response was observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Starting in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, it has spread it spread throughout the world in less than four months and has caused thousands of deaths. The WHO has declared it to be a pandemic. Humanity is shocked, and many governments have imposed total isolation. It has had varying success due to community negligence. In many cities, institutions and health personnel have not successfully managed this catastrophe. Isolation is the only effective strategy to stop the logarithmic growth of COVID 19. The scientific reason for isolation is that more than 60 % of infections arise from asymptomatic people. SARS-CoV-2 not only produces respiratory symptoms but can also cause nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Fifty percent of those infected may have digestive symptoms which may even precede respiratory symptoms. The fecal-oral route can transmit the virus even when there is no diarrhea. All forms of contagion are found in endoscopy units: aerosols from vomiting, retching, bel-ching, and flatus; fecal matter, close contact, and contamination of the environment. All diagnostic endoscopies should be discontinued. Only urgent and therapeutic endoscopy should be performed. All endoscopy personnel must have strict protection measures. Each patient should be informed, and sign an informed consent form, that the virus can be spread within the endoscopy room. After performance of endoscopy, the patient should be contacted by phone on days 7 and 14 to inquire about all symptoms mentioned. © 2020 Asociaciones Colombianas de Gastroenterología, Endoscopia digestiva, Coloproctología y Hepatología.","Aerosols; Contagion; COVID19; Endoscopy; Fecal matter; Protection",,,"Rev.

Obesity is a risk factor for severe disease, and the practice of endoscopy poses special challenges and risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to patients and providers given the evolving role of the gastrointestinal tract in viral transmission and aerosol generation during endoscopic procedures. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between urgent interventions that cannot be postponed despite the risks during the pandemic and, in contrast, purely elective interventions that could be deferred in order to minimize transmission risks during a time of infection surge and limited access. Semi-urgent bariatric procedures have an intermediate position. Since the chronological course of the pandemic is still unpredictable, these interventions were defined according to whether or not they should be performed within a nominal 8-week period. In this position statement, the IFSO Endoscopy Committee offers guidance on navigating bariatric endoscopic procedures in patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the hope of mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to vulnerable patients and healthcare workers.

Results: Among 96 consecutive COVID-19-suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to present with fever (P =.02), cough (P =.03), and pneumonia at computed tomography (CT) scan (P =.002) at admission. Prevalence of D-dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID-19-positive patients (74.2% versus 43.3%; P =.007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D-dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis significantly increased area under the curve for COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19-positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (P =.008) than COVID-19-negative ones. COVID-19-positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had fewer CECs (P =.02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had even fewer CECs (P =.007). Conclusion: Curative anticoagulation could prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and endothelial lesion. © 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","circulating endothelial cells; coagulopathy; COVID-19; D-dimers; SARS-CoV-2",,"32558198","J.

Methods: We analysed 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and haematological malignancies. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared to a matched control group of 53 non-cancer patients with COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with poor outcome. Results: The most frequent haematological diseases were lymphoma (30%) and multiple myeloma (30%). Eighty-seven % HP developed moderate or severe disease. Patients with haematological malignancies had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (35.9% vs 13.2%; P =.003 (odds ratio 6.652). The worst outcome was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. Only age >70 years and C reactive protein >10 mg/dl at admission were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio 34.86, P =.003 and 13.56,P =.03). Persistent viral sheddind was detected in 5 HP. Active chemotherapy, viral load at diagnosis and COVID-19 therapy were not predictors of outcome. Conclusion: Mortality of COVID-19 is significantly higher in patients with haematological malignancies compared to non-cancer patients.

In order to provide prophylactic prevention from the emerging and re-emerging viruses, vaccine is suggested as the most efficient way to prevent individuals from the threat of viral infection. Nonetheless, the highly pathogenic viruses need to be handled in a high level of biosafety containment, which hinders vaccine development. To shorten the timeframe of vaccine development, the pseudovirus system has been widely applied to examine vaccine efficacy or immunogenicity in the emerging and re-emerging viruses. Methods: We developed pseudovirus systems for emerging SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and re-emerging avian influenza virus H5 subtypes which can be handled in the biosafety level 2 facility. Through the generated pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus H5 subtypes, we successfully established a neutralization assay to quantify the neutralizing activity of antisera against the viruses. Results: The result of re-emerging avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudoviruses provided valuable information for antigenic evolution and immunogenicity analysis in vaccine candidate selection. Together, our study assessed the potency of pseudovirus systems in vaccine efficacy, antigenic analysis, and immunogenicity in the vaccine development of emerging and re-emerging viruses. Conclusion: Instead of handling live highly pathogenic viruses in a high biosafety level facility, using pseudovirus systems would speed up the process of vaccine development to provide community protection against emerging and re-emerging viral diseases with high pathogenicity. © 2020 Chang Gung University","Antibody; Antigen; Avian influenza virus; Pseudovirus; Pseudovirus system; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Biomed.

Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We described the clinical features of people infected on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were diagnosed with asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or mild or severe COVID-19, on admission to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) and at the end of observation. Methods: This retrospective, single-centre study included participants with laboratory-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital from Feb 11 to Feb 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analysed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until discharge or Feb 26, 2020, whichever came first. We defined asymptomatic infection as SARS-CoV-2 infection with no history of clinical signs and symptoms, severe COVID-19 as clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnoea, tachypnoea, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <93%, and need for oxygen therapy), and mild COVID-19 as all other symptoms. Clinical features on admission were compared among patients with different disease severity, including asymptomatic infection, at the end of observation. We used univariable analysis to identify factors associated with symptomatic illness among asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Findings: Among the 104 participants included in the final analysis, the median age was 68 years (IQR 47–75) and 54 (52%) were male. On admission, 43 (41%) participants were classified as asymptomatic, 41 (39%) as having mild COVID-10, and 20 (19%) as having severe COVID-19. At the end of observation, 33 (32%) participants were confirmed as being asymptomatic, 43 (41%) as having mild COVID-19, and 28 (27%) as having severe COVID-19. Serum lactate hydrogenase concentrations were significantly higher in the ten participants who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with the 33 participants who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period (five [50%] vs four [12%] participants; odds ratio 7·25, 95% CI 1·43–36·70; p=0·020). Compared with patients with mild disease at the end of observation, patients with severe COVID-19 were older (median age 73 years [IQR 55–77] vs 60 years [40–71]; p=0·028) and had more frequent consolidation on chest CT (13 [46%] of 28 vs nine [21%] of 43; p=0·035) and lymphopenia (16 [57%] vs ten [23%]; p=0·0055) on admission. Interpretation: Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to improved clinical management.

Aim: At a Singaporean tertiary hospital, individuals with clinical syndromes compatible with COVID-19 but no epidemiologic risk were placed in cohorted general wards for COVID-19 testing. To mitigate risk, an infection control bundle was implemented comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved personal protective equipment, and social distancing. We assessed the impact on environmental contamination and transmission. Methods: Upon detection of a case of COVID-19 in the dedicated general ward, patients and health care workers (HCWs) contacts were identified. All patient and staff close-contacts were placed on 14-day phone surveillance and followed up for 28 days; symptomatic contacts were tested. Environmental samples were also obtained. Findings: Over a 3-month period, 28 unsuspected cases of COVID-19 were contained in the dedicated general ward. In 5 of the 28 cases, sampling of the patient's environment yielded SARS-CoV-2; index cases who required supplemental oxygen had higher odds of environmental contamination (P = .01). A total of 253 staff close-contacts and 45 patient close-contacts were identified; only 3 HCWs (1.2%, 3/253) required quarantine. On 28-day follow-up, no patient-to-HCW transmission was documented; only 1 symptomatic patient close-contact tested positive.

In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Many people are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. However, in some cases (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities) the disease may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that can lead to death. Such wide interindividual differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may relate to several pathogen-and host-related factors. These include the different levels of the ubiquitously present human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors gene expression and its variant alleles, the different binding affinities of ACE2 to the virus spike (S) protein given its L-and S-subtypes and the subsequent extent of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia. The extensive synthesis of cytokines and chemokines in coronavirus diseases was suggested as a major factor in exacerbating lung damage and other fatal complications. The polymorphisms in genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been associated with mediating the response and susceptibility to a wide range of infections and their severe outcomes.

The complete genome sequences of around 450 isolates are available, and studies about similarities and differences among them and with the close related viruses that caused similar epidemics in this century. In this work, we studied the complete genome of the first four cases of the new coronavirus disease in Chile, from patients who traveled to Europe and Southeast Asia. Our findings reveal at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory, coming from Europe and Asia. We also sub-classified the isolates into variants according to punctual mutations in the genome.

The relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection was postulated, often without any laboratory, instrumental or clinical confirmation. The disclosure of information about chilblain-like lesions as a COVID-19 manifestation in social media has created concern in children’s families and paediatricians. Objectives: To verify whether the chilblain-like lesions were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from 1 April to 30 April 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset. Results: We evaluated eight patients (five females, three males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients. Skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain. PCR assay on skin lesion biopsy for parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative. We identified common precipitating and risk factors: physical (cold and wet extremities, low BMI), cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment, behaviours, habits and lifestyle. We therefore reached a diagnosis of primary chilblains. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a ‘cluster’ of primary chilblains developed in predisposed subjects, mainly teenagers, due to cold exposure in the lockdown period. Laboratory findings support our hypothesis, although it is also possible that an unknown infectious trigger may have contributed to the pathogenesis. © 2020 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",,,"32533899","J.

We aimed to investigate factors associated with prolonged and intermittent viral RNA shedding in a retrospective cohort of symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Methods: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data from hospitalised COVID-19 patients from a single centre with two consecutive negative respiratory reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were extracted from electronic medical records. Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis was used to assess the effect of clinical characteristics on the duration and pattern of shedding. Plasma levels of immune mediators were measured using Luminex multiplex microbead-based immunoassay. Results: There were 201 symptomatic patients included. Median age was 49 years (interquartile range 16–61), and 52.2% were male. Median RNA shedding was 14 days (IQR 9–18). Intermittent shedding was observed in 77 (38.3%). We did not identify any factor associated with prolonged or intermittent viral RNA shedding. Duration of shedding was inversely correlated with plasma levels of T-cell cytokines IL-1β and IL-17A at the initial phase of infection, and patients had lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during intermittent shedding. Conclusions: Less active T-cell responses at the initial phase of infection were associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding, suggesting that early immune responses are beneficial to control viral load and prevent viral RNA shedding. Intermittent shedding is common and may explain re-detection of viral RNA in recovered patients. © 2020 The Authors.

Although clinical involvement of children and patients with congenital heart disease are not frequent, the emergency care of adults with COVID-19 has almost collapsed our healthcare system. Consequently, the whole standard activity has been minimized during this period. In this manuscript we analyse the reduction of our congenital heart surgery over these 2 months of state of alarm, and we propose strategies to return to normal. Methods: From our Society congenital heart disease working group, a survey was carried out in Spanish congenital heart disease surgery hospitals, in order to find out the decrease in activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the time period from March-13 to May-13, 2020. Results: During the pandemic, congenital heart disease surgery was partially reduced, stepping with the most urgent cases and minimizing the scheduled activity. Compared to the same period in 2019, 51% less major surgery and 54% less extracorporeal surgery were performed. Collaboration in adults COVID-19 front line care has been 15%, having 7% of our specialists on quarantine. Before operating on any patient, the PCR is asked to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and, if positive, we only consider intervention in urgent / emergency cases. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced all the congenital heart disease services nationwide to restructure, aiming to support colleagues with direct treatment of COVID-19, without sacrificing the healthcare of our own patients whose surgery could not be delayed. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Cirugía Cardiovascular y Endovascular","Congenital heart disease; COVID-19; Extracorporeal cardiac surgery",,,"Cir.

It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human. Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs. Case presentation: We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness. We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation. The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages. Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes. We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration. The patient was cured and discharged. Conclusion: This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. © The Author(s). 2020.","Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pneumonia; Tracheoscopy","acetylcysteine; alanine aminotransferase; ambroxol; amoxicillin; antiinfective agent; antivirus agent; bicyclol; bifid triple viable capsule; bio three tablet; clavulanate potassium; D dimer; doxycycline; esomeprazole; glycyrrhizic acid; interferonalfa 1b; levofloxacin; liver protective agent; lopinavir; methylprednisolone; nadroparin; recombinant interferon; ribavirin; ritonavir; unclassified drug; virus RNA; antivirus agent; virus RNA; adult; Article; case report; chest tightness; clinical article; clinical feature; community acquired pneumonia; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; drug substitution; dyspnea; fatigue; fever; gastroesophageal reflux; human; hypoxemia; lung fibrosis; male; microbiological examination; middle aged; myalgia; nasopharyngeal swab; respiratory tract examination; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; China; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diagnostic imaging; fever; isolation and purification; lung; nasopharynx; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Fever; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral","32354369","BMC Infect.

Respiratory droplets and contaction with infected patients are the two major transmission routes. However, the value of tear virus nucleic acid is still not clear. We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts. Methods: Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets. Results: Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T&gt;C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir–ritonavir would be significantly decreased. The flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets showed PD-1+ CD95+ cells was accounting for 94.8% in CD3+ CD8+ T subset and for 94.8% in CD3+ TCRγδ+ T subset. Conclusions: As obstruction of common lacrimal duct, positively detection in one eye for 2 weeks more after nasopharyngeal swab became negative. More eye swabs should be collected from COVID-19 patients, especially from those immunocompromised, those with eye symptoms and those had a history of ocular diseases. © 2020 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

The impact of COVID-19 on solid organ transplantations, including heart transplantation, is currently unclear. Many transplant programs have been forced to swiftly re-evaluate and adapt their practices, leading to a marked decrease in transplants performed. This trend has been due to various factors, including increased donor COVID-19 screening scrutiny and recipient waiting list management in anticipation of COVID-19 critical care surge capacity planning. In the face of these unknown variables, determining when and how to proceed with transplantation in our population of patients with end-stage cardiomyopathies is challenging.

Methods: We performed a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the independent search terms COVID-19, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 and then downloaded the data file on March 23, 2020. All trials were downloaded to a csv file and searched for appropriateness. Results: Of 124 registered trials, 56 (45.2%) were listed as recruiting. The majority (85 [68.5%]) were classified as interventional, 37 (29.8%) as observational, and one (0.8%) each as either expanded access: individual patients|treatment investigational new drug/protocol or expanded access: intermediate-size population|treatment investigational new drug/protocol. There were 67 (54.0%) trials that listed drug as the type of study. Immunologic and antiviral trials were the most common, representing approximately 30% and 21%, respectively. When immunologic and antiviral drugs were used alone or in combination, they represented 41.9% and 34.4%, respectively. Antimalarial agents are represented in 7.5% of trials. Approximately 14% of trials involved traditional Chinese medicine. The study agents used solely or in combination represented approximately 80% of therapeutic approaches to COVID-19. Conclusions: There was a large and quick response on ClinicalTrials.gov to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Some children particularly those with acute or chronic comorbidities are likely to develop critical illness. Recently, a Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) has been described in children with these patients often requiring care in the Pediatric ICU. An international collaboration was formed to review the available evidence and develop evidence-based guidelines for the care of critically ill children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Where the evidence was lacking, those gaps were replaced with consensus-based guidelines. This process has generated 44 recommendations related to pediatric COVID-19 patients presenting with respiratory distress or failure, sepsis or septic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, MIS-C, or those requiring adjuvant therapies, or ECMO. Evidence to explain the milder disease patterns in children and the potential to use repurposed antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory or antithrombotic therapies are also described. Brief summaries of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection in different regions of the world are included since few registries are capturing these data globally. These guidelines seek to harmonize the standards and strategies for intensive care that critically ill children with COVID-19 receive across the world. Impact: At the time of publication, this is the latest evidence for managing critically ill children infected with SARS-CoV-2.Referring to these guidelines can decrease the morbidity and potentially the mortality of children effected by COVID-19 and its sequalae.These guidelines can be adapted to both high- and limited-resource settings. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,"Pediatr.

The SARS-Co-2 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. There have been about 6.5 million reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and about 350 000 reported deaths throughout the world within the last 6 months from the onset of the epidemic. The virus is primarily transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets. The COVID-19 patient usually presents with fever, cough, sore throat and breathlessness.

About 5% of these may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction. To date, there is no recommended medical treatment, and supportive measures are a crucial part of management.

In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown. Methods: We performed a real-world diagnostic accuracy study of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of SARS-CoV-2 PCR on combined nose and throat swabs. A multivariable predictive model including FebriDx, age, sex, and clinical characteristics was developed and underwent internal validation. Results: FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. FebriDx results were available after 10 min compared with 1.7 (1.6 to 2.1) hours with point-of-care PCR testing and 23.4 (17.2 to 31.1) hours with laboratory PCR testing. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.73 (95%CI 4.37 to 10.37) and 0.08 (95%CI 0.04 to 0.15) respectively. In the multivariate model age, sex and other clinical features did not contribute significantly to the effect of the FebriDx result in distinguishing patients with and without COVID-19. Conclusions: During the first wave of the pandemic, FebriDx had high accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 in hospitalised adults and could be deployed as a front door triage tool.

We found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs 671 [95% CI, 368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, which was associated with disease severity. Further studies are required to understand the relationship between high NAb response and disease severity. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Capacity for acute diagnosis via PCR testing was limited for individuals with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial proportion of health-care workers with suspected infection were not tested. We aimed to investigate the performance of point-of-care and laboratory serology assays and their utility in late case identification, and to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Methods: We did a prospective multicentre cohort study between April 8 and June 12, 2020, in two phases. Symptomatic health-care workers with mild to moderate symptoms were eligible to participate 14 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as per the Public Health England (PHE) case definition. Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93·4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8·0%] of 5049). Findings: There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93·4% [95% CI 87·8–96·9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99·0% [94·6–100·0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94·0% [91·3–96·7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88·2% [95% CI 81·6–93·1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94·0% [87·4–97·8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84·7% [80·6–88·7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9·3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8·8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9·8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10·6% (95% CI 7·6–13·6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44·7% (42·0–47·4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18·0% (95% CI 17·0–18·9). Interpretation: Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing.

Methods: Retrospective case-control study of 160 hip fractures operated upon between December 2019 and May 2020. Based on the date of declaration of national lockdown, the cohort was separated into two groups: ‘pre-COVID time’ (PCT), including 86 patients, and ‘COVID time’ (CT), consisting of 74 patients. All CT patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were stratified based on demographic characteristics. Outcome measures were 30-day complications, readmissions and mortality. A logistic regression model was run to evaluate factors associated with mortality. Results: Age, female/male ratio, body mass index and American Society of Anaesthesia score were similar between both groups (p > 0.05). CT patients had a higher percentage of Charlson ≥ 5 and Rockwood Frailty Index ≥ 5 scores (p < 0.05) as well as lower UCLA and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores (p < 0.05). This translated into a higher hemiarthroplasty/total hip arthroplasty ratio during CT (p = 0.04). Thromboembolic disease was higher during CT (p = 0.02). Readmissions (all negative for SARS-CoV-2) were similar between both groups (p = 0.34). Eight (10.8%) casualties were detected in the CT group, whereas no deaths were seen in the control group. Logistic regression showed that frailer (p = 0.006, OR 10.46, 95%CI 8.95–16.1), less active (p = 0.018, OR 2.45, 95%CI 1.45–2.72) and those with a thromboembolic event (p = 0.005, OR 30, 95%CI 11–42) had a higher risk of mortality. Conclusion: Despite testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, CT patients were less active and frailer than PCT patients, depicting an epidemiological shift that was associated with higher mortality rate. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.","COVID-19; Frailty; Hemiarthroplasty; Hip fracture; Mortality; Readmissions; Total hip arthroplasty",,,"Int.

Methods: We present four patients in this study, selected from among patients who presented with pneumonia symptoms and were suspicious for COVID-19. They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were also tested for influenza viruses and the complete respiratory panel. Results: In the present report, four patients were diagnosed in the starting days of COVID-19 disease in our center in southern Iran with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus.

This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and health-care service planning during the ongoing pandemic. Methods: This multicentre cohort study involved 82 participating health-care institutions across 25 European countries, using a well established research network—the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet)—that mainly comprises paediatric infectious diseases specialists and paediatric pulmonologists. We included all individuals aged 18 years or younger with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected at any anatomical site by RT-PCR, between April 1 and April 24, 2020, during the initial peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis, and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission. Findings: 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 5·0 years (IQR 0·5–12·0) and a sex ratio of 1·15 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2–11, range 1–34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (<1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 5·06, 95% CI 1·72–14·87; p=0·0035), male sex (2·12, 1·06–4·21; p=0·033), pre-existing medical conditions (3·27, 1·67–6·42; p=0·0015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (10·46, 5·16–21·23; p<0·0001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavir–ritonavir (six [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (three [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (seven [1%] patients), tocilizumab (four [1%] patients), anakinra (three [1%] patients), and siltuximab (one [<1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 0·69%, 95% CI 0·20–1·82); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support. Interpretation: COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.

Many of the alternatives available to hospitals have not been certified, leaving uncertainty about their ability to properly protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Objective: For situations where regulatory methods are not accessible, we present experimental methods to evaluate mask filtration and breathability quickly via cost-effective approaches (e.g., ~$2000 USD) that could be replicated in communities of need without extensive infrastructure. We demonstrate the need for screening by evaluating an existing diverse inventory of masks/respirators from a local hospital. Methods: Two experimental approaches are presented to examine both aerosol filtration and flow impedance (i.e., breathability). For one of the approaches (“quick assessment”), screening for appropriate filtration could be performed under 10 min per mask, on average. Mask fit tests were conducted in tandem but are not the focus of this study. Results: Tests conducted of 47 nonregulation masks reveal variable performance. A number of commercially available masks in hospital inventories perform similarly to N95 masks for aerosol filtration of 0.2 μm and above, but there is a range of masks with relatively lower filtration efficiencies (e.g., <90%) and a subset with poorer filtration (e.g., <70%). All masks functioned acceptably for breathability, and impedance was not correlated with filtration efficiency. Significance: With simplified tests, organizations with mask/respirator shortages and uncertain inventories can make informed decisions about use and procurement. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","COVID-19; Masks; N95 respirators; Personal protective equipment (PPE); SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

Design: A failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) was conducted by a multidisciplinary IVF team. A schematic representation of new protocols and procedures adopted during COVID-19 emergency has been defined, including directives about the behaviour to adopt when entering the clinic and the laboratory, in case of face-to-face contact with patients and between staff members. In addition, the risk of cross-contamination between samples belonging to different patients during cell handling and manipulation has been evaluated. Potential failure modes for each phase of the emergency have been analysed, focusing on possible sources of error. Risk priority numbers have been calculated as products of Occurrence × Severity × Detection scores. Results: Except for cell–cell contamination, which was considered highly unlikely, failure modes during patient–staff, staff–staff and staff–cell interactions were estimated as carrrying a moderate to high risk of infection. The main corrective measures entailed precautionary logistic measures, the implementation of additional personal protective equipment and changes in the IVF laboratory procedures and scheduling of the daily routine. Some procedures were also revised, aiming to increase staff's awareness and caution. Conclusions: Standard laboratory protocols are insufficient to face a virus whose transmission is aerosol mediated. The measures outlined in this FMEA should thus be considered not only for facing this pandemic, but also for the future to promptly manage any aerosol-mediated virus infection, whose impact on the management of an IVF laboratory might be less severe than COVID-19 although not completely negligible. © 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.","FMEA; IVF laboratory; Risk assessment; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Reprod.

While the analogous event in China appears to be under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of development. Italy, at present, is playing a major role in understanding the transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. Methods: We combined a quarantined model with early-stage development data in Italy (during the period February 20th–March 30th) to predict longer-term progression (from March 30th, till June 25th, 2020 in a long-term view) with different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnosis rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework, we analyze the possible secondary infection event after relaxing the isolation measures. Outcomes and interpretation: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side, the contact rate must be kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for a long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter (Formula presented.) I connected with the time t I = 1/δI (Formula presented.) needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy, this time must fall under 12–8 h in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover, we show how the same parameter plays an even more important role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event. © 2020 Society for Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases.","infection; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; secondary effects",,"32730140","Infect.

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizol-based RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.

Methods: This is a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study. Adult COVID-19 cases from four hospitals in Zhejiang were enrolled and clustered into three groups based on epidemiological history. First-generation patients had a travel history to Hubei within 14 days before disease onset; second-generation patients had a contact history with first-generation patients; third-generation patients had a contact history with second-generation patients. Demographic, clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes and duration of viral shedding were analysed. Results: A total of 171 patients were enrolled, with 83, 44 and 44 patients in the first-, second-, and third-generation, respectively. Compared with the first and second generations, third-generation patients were older (61.3 vs. 48.3 and 44.0 years, p < 0.001) and had more coexisting conditions (56.8% vs. 36.1% and 27.3%, p 0.013).

Few studies investigated the epidemic characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in the well-developed cities. Methods: Epidemiological data of 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from the dataset of COVID-19 in Tianjin. All confirmed cases were categorized according to their potential infection sources. Daily numbers of confirmed cases of each category were plotted by date of onset, and the epidemic form of each category was inferred. Results: Among the 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 48 cases were categorized as imported cases and their close contacts, which were the majority of early cases. A total of 43 cases were found an epidemiological link to the Baodi department store, and they were inferred to be a common-source outbreak. Additionally, 35 cases were considered as familial clusters of COVID-19 cases, and 10 cases were sporadic. The 45 cases were inferred to be a propagated epidemic.

Method: We described a family cluster of COVID-19 patients who were admitted during 3rd April 2020 to 30th April 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by a presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the respiratory specimens detected by a qualitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Results: A family cluster of four laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, one of those carried an underlying kidney transplant (KT) receiving immunosuppressants. Clinical presentation and severity of our case series are variable depending on each individual immune status. By far, a KT recipient seems to develop more severity despite antiviral therapy, cessation of immunosuppressant, and aggressive intensive care support. Conclusion: Our case series plausibly affirmed a person-to-person transmission and potentially severe disease in the transplant population.

Methods: 27 pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. CT examination and molecular assay tests were performed from all participants. A standard checklist was utilized to extract information, and two radiologists separately reviewed the CT images. Results: The mean age of patients was 4.7 ± 4.16 (mean ± SD) years. Seventeen patients were female, and ten were male. The most common imaging finding was ground-glass opacities followed by consolidations. Seven patients had a single area of involvement, five patients had multiple areas of involvement, and four patients had diffuse involvement. The sensitivity of CT imaging in diagnosing infections was 66.67%. Also, some uncommon imaging findings were seen, such as a tree-in-bud and lung collapse. Conclusion: CT imaging shows less involvement in pediatric compared to adult patients, due to pediatric patients having a milder form of the disease. CT imaging also has a lower sensitivity in detecting abnormal lungs compared to adult patients.

The coronaviral entry requires the spike (S)-protein for attachment to the host cell surface, and employs human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S-protein priming. Although coronaviruses undergo evolution by mutating themselves, it is also essential to know the host genetic factors. Here, we describe the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Methods: The genetic variants derived from five population-sequencing projects were classified by variant type, allele frequency (AF), ethnic group and estimated pathogenicity. The SNVs in SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues were investigated. The genetic variability was normalised using non-linear regression and the total number of SNVs was estimated by the derived formulas. Results: We detected 349 and 551 SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, in a total of 156 513 individuals. The vast majority (>97%) of the SNVs were very rare (AF <0.1%) and population-specific, and were computationally estimated to be more frequently deleterious than the SNVs with high AF. These SNVs were distributed throughout the coding regions; some ACE2 variants were located in the SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues, with a hemizygous state occurring in males. Using regression analysis, the total numbers of genetic variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were 1.1×103 and 1.5×103, respectively, for a population of one million people. Conclusion: The majority of SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are rare, population-specific and deleterious, and a multitude of very rare SNVs may explain different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The disease primarily affects the lower respiratory system, but may involve other organs and systems. Histopathologic evaluation of tissue from affected patients is crucial for diagnostic purposes, but also for advancing our understanding of the disease. For that reason, we developed immunohistochemical (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for detection of the. virus. A total of eight autopsy lungs, one placenta, and ten kidney biopsies from COVID-19 patients were stained with a panel of commercially available antibodies for IHC and commercially available RNA probes for ISH. Similarly, autopsy lungs, placentas and renal biopsies from non-COVID-19 patients were stained with the same antibodies and probes. All eight lungs and the placenta from COVID-19 patients stained positive by IHC and ISH, while the kidney biopsies stained negative by both methodologies. As expected, all specimens from non-COVID-19 patients were IHC and ISH negative. These two assays represent a sensitive and specific method for detecting the virus in tissue samples. We provide the protocols and the list of commercially available antibodies and probes for these assays, so they can be readily implemented in pathology laboratories and medical examiner offices for diagnostic and research purposes. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology.",,,,"Lab.

This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life. This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency. This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility. Therefore, public health literacy is needed. © 2020, Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica.","Covid-19; Health literacy; Mexico; SARS-CoV-2; Surveillance","Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; genetics; hand washing; health literacy; health survey; human; laboratory technique; mask; pandemic; personal space; procedures; public health; sentinel surveillance; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation; symptom assessment; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Hand Hygiene; Health Literacy; Humans; Masks; Pandemics; Personal Space; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Sentinel Surveillance; Social Isolation; Symptom Assessment","32304371","Salud Publica Mex.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083865690

Recent studies showed pneumothorax in rare cases, but tension pneumothorax has only been reported once. Case presentation: A 47-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with fever, dry cough and sore throat for the last 14 days as well as acute stenocardia and shortage of breath. Sputum testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial computed tomography (CT) showed bipulmonary groundglass opacities and consolidations with peripheral distribution. Hospitalization with supportive therapy (azithromycin) as well as non-invasive oxygenation led to a stabilization of the patient. After 5 days, sputum testing was negative and IgA/IgG antibody titres were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was discharged after 7 days. On the 11th day, the patient realized pronounced dyspnoea after coughing and presented to the emergency department again. CT showed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, which was relieved by a chest drain (Buelau) via mini open thoracotomy. Negative pressure therapy resulted in regression of the pneumothorax and the patient was discharged after 9 days of treatment. Conclusion: Treating physicians should be aware that COVID-19 patients might develop severe secondary pulmonary complications such as acute tension pneumothorax.

There is currently not enough data in favour of danger or benefit from corticosteroids in COVID-19, so until this matter is resolved it is advisable to limit their indications to the most serious clinical pictures for which it is well established that this type of treatment has a positive impact on the progression of symptoms. In Grade V and VI Bell's palsy according to the House-Brackmann grading system, a week's course of oral corticosteroids is recommended. Corticosteroid therapy is also recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss of more than 60 dB, either in the form of intratympanic injections or a week's course of oral medication. In rhinology, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroid therapy in the current situation. However, patients are advised to continue with their local corticosteroid therapy in the form of a nasal spray or by inhalation. Treatments with corticosteroid nasal sprays can still be prescribed if there is no alternative.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period among 34 provincial regions in China. Our main assumption was that blood donors of all ages in different regions have a stable blood donation intention and the same infection risk. RESULTS: First, we estimated the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and China, from December 31, 2019 to March 17, 2020. Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in all provinces across China. In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID-19 incubation period. Moreover, if the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk is low, with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 and the appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and a high fatality rate, appropriate measures should be taken by health departments to ensure the safety of clinical blood. © 2020 The Authors.

Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic Methodology: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell Results: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation Conclusions: Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trig-ger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19. © 2020, International Rhinologic Society.

The pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in minimal disease in this initial phase are not well known. In the remaining 20% of cases, the disease may become severe and/or critical. In most patients of this latter group, there is a phase characterized by the hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. A third phase corresponds to a state of hypercoagulability. Finally, in the fourth stage organ injury and failure occur. Appearance of autoinflammatory/autoimmune phenomena in patients with COVID-19 calls attention for the development of new strategies for the management of life-threatening conditions in critically ill patients. Antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune cytopenia, Guillain-Barré syndrome and Kawasaki disease have each been reported in patients with COVID-19. Here we present a scoping review of the relevant immunological findings in COVID-19 as well as the current reports about autoinflammatory/autoimmune conditions associated with the disease. These observations have crucial therapeutic implications since immunomodulatory drugs are at present the most likely best candidates for COVID-19 therapy.

Methods: A total of 244 inpatients aged ≥ 60 years with COVID-19 were included in this study, of whom 52 were clinically diagnosed and 192 were microbiologically diagnosed. Clinical and laboratory data on hospital admission and outcomes (discharged or died in hospital) of all patients were retrieved from medical records retrospectively. Patients who met the criteria for clinical diagnosis with negative virus test results were assigned to the clinical diagnosis group, whereas those with positive virus test results were assigned to the microbiological diagnosis group. After univariate analyses, two propensity score analyses [i.e., covariate adjustment using propensity score (CAPS) and propensity score matching (PSM)] were conducted to control bias. Results: The clinical and microbiological diagnosis groups demonstrated significant differences in outcomes and in the majority of laboratory findings. After propensity score analyses, many differences between the two groups disappeared and the rate of mortality had no statistically significant difference (P = 0.318 and 0.828 for CAPS and PSM, respectively). Conclusions: Patients with similar signs, symptoms, and laboratory and imaging findings as confirmed COVID-19 cases may have a similar mortality risk, regardless of the virus test results, and require timely intervention to reduce their mortality. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Clinical diagnosis; COVID-19; Microbiological diagnosis; Older patients; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Aging Clin.

Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply-chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an “unextracted modification” for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation—with or without VTM spin concentration—into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher Ct values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; diagnostics; RNA; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; unextracted",,,"J.

Liver dysfunction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19, although its significance has not yet been elucidated. Methods: The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as having severe COVID-19. Results: All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum AST and/or ALT levels to ≥ 3 times the ULN, was seen in 2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum ALP, γ-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to ≥ twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S) ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than in the latter patients (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed the optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio of 1.03 for discriminating between patients with severe and non-severe diseases. The hepatic CT attenuation values increased at the remission phase of the disease as compared to the values at admission (P = 0.012).

Objective: The objective was to analyze the patients’ characteristics, hematological, bio-chemical, and chest imaging findings among the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Egypt and also to shed light on the predictors of COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 66 patients with COVID-19 in Egypt. Medical history, imaging data (CT chest findings), and measured hematological and biochemical parameters at diagnosis were recorded in the form of complete blood counts and differential counts; CRP, ESR, serum ferritin, creatinine, and liver function tests . Results of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at diagnosis and during follow up of these patients were also recorded. Results: The study included 36 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and 30 patients with severe/critical infection. There was a significant older age among severe (62.6 years old ±10.1SD) than mild to moderate infection (55.5 ± 10.1) (p˂0.05). Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and sore throat malaise were highly frequent among COVID-19 patients, while headache and diarrhea were the least frequently occurring manifestations. All included cases (30 patients, 100%) with severe COVID-19 showed crazy-paving appearance (in the form of reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening) with or without GGO. There were significantly lower mean values of WBCs, lymphocytic count, total protein, and albumin among the severely infected than those who had mild to moderate COVID-19 infection, p˂0.05 for all. Additionally, there were significantly higher mean values of CRP, ESR, ferritin, ALT, and AST among patients with severe/critical COVID-19 when compared with those having mild to moderate COVID-19, p˂0.05 for all. Conclusion: Among the studied demographic, clinical, hematological, biochemical, and imaging data, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, lymphopenia, raised CRP, ESR, ferritin, ALT, AST, low albumin, and presence of CT chest findings could be considered as predictors for COVID-19 severity using binary logistic regression analysis. © 2020 Ghweil et al.","Biochemical markers; Clinical data; COVID-19; Egypt; Hematological parameters; SARS-CoV-2 RNA; Severity","albumin; C reactive protein; creatinine; ferritin; adult; Article; biochemical analysis; blood cell count; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; creatinine blood level; diarrhea; disease severity; dyspnea; Egypt; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; ferritin blood level; fever; headache; hematological parameters; human; human cell; leukocyte; liver function test; major clinical study; malaise; male; middle aged; mortality rate; nonhuman; quarantine station; retrospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; thorax radiography; virus detection",,"Infect.

Methods: A comprehensive literature review on COVID-19 was conducted. A two-stage modified Delphi technique involving 18 oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons across Canada was used to determine consensus risk-stratification criteria and PPE recommendations for surgeries performed in the North American context. Results: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We summarize COVID-19 virology and transmission, as well as practice considerations for oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted predominantly by droplet mechanisms, some studies suggest that transmission is possible through aerosols. Among common procedures performed by oculofacial and plastic surgeons, some are likely to be considered aerosol-generating. Risk of transmission increases when manipulating structures known to harbor high viral loads. We present an algorithm for risk-stratification based on the nature of surgery and the anatomical sites involved and offer recommendations for PPE. Conclusions: Although universal droplet precautions are now recommended in most healthcare settings, some clinical situations require more stringent infection control measures. By highlighting high-risk scenarios specific to oculofacial plastic and orbital surgery, as well as PPE recommendations, we hope to enhance the safety of continued care during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; equipment; personal; protective; surgery","aerosol; algorithm; Article; Canada; clinical feature; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; Delphi study; eye surgery; human; nonhuman; oculofacial plastic surgery; orbit; pandemic; plastic surgeon; plastic surgery; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus load; virus transmission","32552229","Orbit (London)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087387992

Demographic survey data, change of clinical practice, current performance of procedures, and current commencement of treatment for 5 conditions in medical urological oncology were evaluated. Results: 235 urologists from 44 countries responded. Out of them, 93% indicated a change of clinical practice due to COVID-19. In a 4-tiered surgery down-escalation scheme, 44% reported to make first cancellations, 23% secondary cancellations, 20% last cancellations and 13% emergency cases only. Oncological surgeries had low cancellation rates (%): transurethral resection of bladder tumor (27%), radical cystectomy (21–24%), nephroureterectomy (21%), radical nephrectomy (18%), and radical orchiectomy (8%). (Neo)adjuvant/palliative treatment is currently not started by more than half of the urologists. COVID-19 high-risk-countries had higher total cancellation rates for non-oncological procedures (78% vs. 68%, p = 0.01) and were performing oncological treatment for metastatic diseases at a lower rate (35% vs. 48%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice of 93% of urologists worldwide. The impact of implementing surgical prioritization protocols with moderate cancellation rates for oncological surgeries and delay or reduction in (neo)adjuvant/palliative treatment will have to be evaluated after the pandemic. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; Healthcare; SARS-CoV-2; Triage",,,"World J.

Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in low-probability settings is proposed but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Blood transfusion services had experience in performance of high throughput nucleic acid testing (NAT) analysis and can support the national health system by screening of the inhabitants for SARS-COV-2. Methods: We evaluated a new approach of a multiple-swab method by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. Analytical sensitivity was constant up to a total number of 50 swabs. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (5-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (10-sample pools). Results: The novel method did not cause false-negative results with nonsignificantly differing cycle threshold values between single-swab and multiple-swab NAT. In two routine applications, all minipools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. Conclusions: The new method enables countries to increase the total number of testing significantly. The multiple-swab method is able to screen system relevant groups of employees frequently. The example in Germany shows that blood transfusion services can support general health systems with their experience in NAT and their high-throughput instruments. Screening of a huge number of inhabitants is currently the only option to prevent a second infection wave and enable exit strategies in many countries. © 2020 The Authors.

We also aimed to investigate whether CT findings may be predictive of patients’ outcome. Methods: From March 6 to March 22, 2020, 130 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled for this single-center analysis and chest CT examinations were retrospectively evaluated. A semi-quantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement (0:0%; 1, < 5%; 2:5–25%; 3:26–50%; 4:51–75%; 5, > 75%; range 0–5; global score 0–25). Data were matched with clinical stages and laboratory findings. Survival curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the role of CT score as a predictor of patients’ outcome. Results: Ground glass opacities were predominant in early-phase (≤ 7 days since symptoms’ onset), while crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis characterized late-phase disease (> 7 days). CT score was significantly higher in critical and severe than in mild stage (p < 0.0001), and among late-phase than early-phase patients (p < 0.0001). CT score was significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6204) and D-dimer (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6625) levels. A CT score of ≥ 18 was associated with an increased mortality risk and was found to be predictive of death both in univariate (HR, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.19–21.73; p < 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.10–12.77; p = 0.0348). Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest the potential role of CT score for predicting the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 patients. CT score is highly correlated with laboratory findings and disease severity and might be beneficial to speed-up diagnostic workflow in symptomatic cases. Key Points: • CT score is positively correlated with age, inflammatory biomarkers, severity of clinical categories, and disease phases. • A CT score ≥ 18 has shown to be highly predictive of patient’s mortality in short-term follow-up. • Our multivariate analysis demonstrated that CT parenchymal assessment may more accurately reflect short-term outcome, providing a direct visualization of anatomic injury compared with non-specific inflammatory biomarkers. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","COVID-19; Pneumonia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Tomography, X-ray computed",,"32623505","Eur.

Infected individuals with suspected (clinical diagnosis) or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited. Patients completed a survey-based questionnaire with the aim of assessing their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, general otorhinolaryngological symptoms, and smell and taste disorders. A total of 294 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 completed the survey (147 females). The most prevalent general symptoms included fever, myalgia, cough, and headache. A total of 70.4% and 59.2% of patients reported smell and taste disorders, respectively. A significant association between the two above-mentioned disorders was found (rs: 0.412; P <.001). Smell disorders occurred before the other symptoms in 11.6% of patients and was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea.

The structural equation model confirmed significant standardized paths (P <.05) between general symptoms, comorbidities, and general otorhinolaryngological complaints in the absence of a significant correlation between these elements and smell and taste alterations. The prevalence of smell and taste disorders in mild-to-moderate Italian COVID-19 patients is significant both in suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases and reveals a strong correlation between these clinical signs regardless of the presence of general or otorhinolaryngological symptoms, such as nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","anosmia; coronavirus; COVID-19; ENT; SARS-CoV-2; smell and taste; structural equation model",,"32710639","J.

This study investigated possible relationships between anti-hypertensive medications use and COVID-19 infection risk in the ambulatory hypertensive population. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study involving 34 936 hypertensive adults >50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) who were retrospectively followed through pandemic period (from 01/03/2020 to 30/04/2020). Two data sets including demographic/clinical characteristics (comorbidities and cardiovascular medications use) and laboratory PCR codes for COVID-19 were linked to construct an anonymized research database. Cox regression was used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and estimate the risk of suffering COVID-19 infection. Across study period, 205 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed, which means an overall incidence of 586.8 cases per 100 000 persons-period. In multivariable analyses, only age (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05; P <.001) and nursing home residence (HR: 19.60; 95% CI: 13.80-27.84; P <.001) appeared significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Considering anti-hypertensive drugs, receiving diuretics (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.90-1.67; P =.205), calcium channel blockers (HR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.91-1.82; P =.148), beta-blockers (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.68-1.37; P =.844), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.61-1.13; P =.238) did not significantly alter the risk of PCR-confirmed COVID-19, whereas receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers was associated with an almost statistically significant reduction risk (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.44-1.01; P =.054).

Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making. Aim: Our objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies. Methods: We developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT90) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls. Results: IgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT90 were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT90 tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test. Conclusion: Using IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies. © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Surgical care has been impacted, with concerns raised around surgical safety, especially in terms of laparoscopic versus open surgery. Due to potential aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, precautions during aerosol-generating procedures and production of surgical plume are paramount for the safety of surgical teams. Methods: A rapid review methodology was used with evidence sourced from PubMed, Departments of Health, surgical colleges and other health authorities. From this, a working group of expert surgeons developed recommendations for surgical safety in the current environment. Results: Pre-operative testing of surgical patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction does not guarantee lack of infectivity due to a demonstrated false-negative rate of up to 30%. All bodily tissues and fluids should therefore be treated as a potential source of COVID-19 infection during operative management. Caution must be taken, especially when using an energy source that produces surgical plumes, and an appropriate capture device should also be used. Limiting the use of such devices or using lower energy devices is desirable. To reduce perceived risks association with desufflation of pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery, an appropriate suction irrigator system, attached to a high-efficiency particulate air filter, should be used. Additionally, appropriate use of personal protective equipment by the surgical team is necessary during high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. Conclusions: As a result of the rapid review, evidence-based guidance has been produced to support safe surgical practice. © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons","COVID-19; operative; safety; specialties, surgical; standards; surgical procedures",,,"ANZ J.

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease. Methods: The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team. Results: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home. Conclusion: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease. © 2020 Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","COVID-19; Epidemiologic study; SARS-CoV-2","analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; adult; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; case study; chill; China; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; family; female; fever; headache; home; human; Japan; male; middle aged; myalgia; priority journal; secondary infection; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Singapore; sore throat; South Korea; sputum; Thailand; travel; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; weakness",,"Osong Public Health Res.

In this study, we enrolled 71 confirmed cases of COVID-19 who were discharged from hospital and transferred to isolation wards from 6 February to 26 March 2020. They were all employees or their family members of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, of which three cases <18 years of age. Clinical data were collected and analysed statistically. Forty-one cases (41/71, 57.7%) were medical faculty, young and middle-aged patients (age<60 years) accounted for 81.7% (58/71). The average isolation time of all adult patients was 13.8±6.1 days. In convalescence period, RNA detection results of 35.2% patients (25/71) turned negative to positive. The longest RNA RP time was 7 days. Fifty-two point nine per cent of adult patients (36/68) had no obvious clinical symptoms, and the remaining patients had mild and non-specific clinical symptoms (e.g., cough, sputum, sore throat, gastrointestinal tract, etc.). Chest CT signs in 89.7% of adult patients (61/68) gradually improved, and in the others, the lesions were eventually absorbed and improved after short-term repeated progression. Main, chest CT manifestations of adult patients were normal, GGO or short-term repeated progression. Main, chest CT manifestations of adult patients were normal, GGO or fiber streak shadow, and six patients (8.8%) had extrapulmonary manifestations, but there was no significant correlation with RNA detection results (r=-0.008, P>0.05). The drug treatment was mainly symptomatic support therapy, and antibiotics and antiviral drugs were ineffective.

The spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease have led to the widespread adoption of social distancing measures. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission have been applied at all social levels, including health care operators. Hence, this reports focuses on the description of a new protocol for the safe management of cytological samples processed by liquid-based cytology (LBC) with an evaluation of the changes in terms of morphology and immunoreactivity. Methods: From March 11 to April 25, 2020, 414 cytological cases suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 were processed with a new virus-inactivating method suggested by Hologic, Inc, for all LBC specimens. Results: The samples showed an increased amount of fibrin in the background. A slight decrease in cellular size was also observed in comparison with the standard method of preparation. Nonetheless, the nuclear details of the neoplastic cells were well identified, and the immunoreactivity of the majority of those cells was maintained. The cell blocks did not show significant differences in morphology, immunoreactivity, or nucleic acid stability. Conclusions: Despite some minor changes in the morphology of the cells, the results of this study highlight that the adoption of the new protocol for the biosafety of LBC-processed samples in pathology laboratories is important for minimizing the risk for personnel, trainees, and cytopathologists without impairing the diagnostic efficacy of the technique. © 2020 American Cancer Society","coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); cytology; diagnosis; liquid-based cytology",,,"Cancer Cytho.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089090974

Apart from respiratory complications, acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) has been observed in some patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we described the clinical characteristics, laboratory features, treatment and outcomes of CVD complicating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and methods: Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were collected and analysed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with COVID-19 with or without new-onset CVD were compared. Results: Of 219 patients with COVID-19, 10 (4.6%) developed acute ischaemic stroke and 1 (0.5%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. COVID-19 with new onset of CVD were significantly older (75.7±10.8 years vs 52.1±15.3 years, p<0.001), more likely to present with severe COVID-19 (81.8% vs 39.9%, p<0.01) and were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and medical history of CVD (all p<0.05). In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state as reflected in C reactive protein (51.1 (1.3-127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1-212.0) mg/L, p<0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3-20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1-20.0) mg/L, p<0.001). Of 10 patients with ischemic stroke; 6 received antiplatelet treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel; and 3 of them died. The other four patients received anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin and 2 of them died. As of 24 March 2020, six patients with CVD died (54.5%). Conclusion: Acute CVD is not uncommon in COVID-19. Our findings suggest that older patients with risk factors are more likely to develop CVD. The development of CVD is an important negative prognostic factor which requires further study to identify optimal management strategy to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The human cost of COVID pandemic could be extraordinary. We find ourselves in a time of great economic, social, and medical uncertainty. The pandemic demands action on many fronts, from prevention to testing to treatment. We need to create simple, cheap, more accessible testing for SARS-CoV-2. A faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus. More than 100 vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 are at various stages of development. Some six groups have already begun injecting formulations into volunteers in safety trials; others have started testing in animals. The biggest challenge is to determine which vaccine is ideal. Reason and science have to guide us. There is urgent need to critically appraise evidence in deciding how to treat patients. We need a drug or com-bination of drugs that work. Remdesivirn-commehas generated hope. It may prove to be a magic bullet. Countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand have done exceptionally well to contain the spread of COVID-19. It is widely believed that during the pandemic treatment suffers. Patients with diseases like cancer, diabetes, renal failure, CAD and pregnant women need special attention. As the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor, governments must prevent dev-astating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures. Nations will have endemic SARS-CoV-2 infection for the foreseeable future. A structured and well-coordinated approach is critical for tackling this global crisis. © the Author(s), 2020.","COVID19; Emerging infectious diseases; Pandemic; Social distancing; Socioeconomic impact","adcovid; amnioboost; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; at 100; avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus vaccine; bpi 002; brilacidin; bxt 25; cytodyn leronlimab; DNA vaccine; fusogenix; galidesivir; gimsilumab; ifenprodil; ino 4800; np 120; nucleocapsid protein; oya1; recombinant vaccine; regn3048 3051; remdesivir; sarilumab; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; sng001; subunit vaccine; tjm2; tnx 1800; tocilizumab; tzls 501; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amino acid sequence; Article; asymptomatic disease; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; diabetes mellitus; disease burden; disease severity; drug development; economics; education; emergency health service; endemic disease; government; health care availability; health care planning; herd immunity; hospital bed capacity; hospitalization; human; immunization; infection control; intensive care unit; kidney failure; lockdown; mortality; pandemic; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; poverty; quarantine; RNA interference; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social interaction; stigma; travel; United States; unplanned pregnancy; virus genome; virus transmission",,"J.

To establish a proper quarantine strategy, it is essential to understand how easily the virus can spread in the communities. Methods: In this study, we collected detailed information on the circumstances in which human-to-human transmission occurred in the tertiary transmission cases of COVID-19 in the community. Results: On January 26, 2020, an imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed, and by February 10, 2020, one secondary transmission and three tertiary transmissions were identified. Secondary transmission occurred on the first day of illness of the infector, and his symptoms were suggestive of a common cold. The transmission occurred during a 90-minute long meal together in a restaurant. The people were sitting within one meter of each other, and had no direct contact. The tertiary transmission also occurred on the first-day illness of the other infector, and his only symptom was slight chills. The transmission occurred at a church during 2-hour-long worship, and two rows separated them. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 could transmit the virus from the first day of illness through daily activities in the community. Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 may be challenging. © 2020 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.","Common cold; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Transmission","antipyretic agent; antivirus agent; interferon; adult; Article; body temperature measurement; case report; chill; China; clinical article; common cold; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; daily life activity; diabetes mellitus; disease course; dyspnea; female; fever; food intake; ground glass opacity; high resolution computer tomography; hospital admission; human; human tissue; hyperlipidemia; isolation facility; Korea; lung lesion; lung parenchyma; male; medical history; middle aged; myalgia; quarantine; real time polymerase chain reaction; religion; restaurant; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sneezing; social distance; sore throat; stomach cancer; travel; virus transmission; young adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; pandemic; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Young Adult","32506866","Korean J.

All the patients were confirmed by nucleic acid detection, the average age of whom was 45.25 years (range, 23–79 years). Most patients had a history of Wuhan traveling or had contact with Wuhan travelers or infected cases. Obvious family cluster was observed. Clinical manifestations included fever (12/12), fatigue (10/12), cough (6/12), sore throat (4/12), headache (3/12), and diarrhea (2/12). Only three out of eight patients had pneumonia manifestation on radiography. Most patients had a normal white blood cell (WBC) count and normal or reduced lymphocyte (LY) count.

Study Design: Cadaveric simulation. Setting: Surgical simulation laboratory. Methods: An optical particle size spectrometer was used to quantify 1- to 10-µm aerosols 30 cm from mastoid cortex drilling. Two barrier drapes were evaluated: OtoTent1, a drape sheet affixed to the microscope; OtoTent2, a custom-structured drape that enclosed the surgical field with specialized ports. Results: Mastoid drilling without a barrier drape, with or without an aerosol-scavenging second suction, generated large amounts of 1- to 10-µm particulate. Drilling under OtoTent1 generated a high density of particles when compared with baseline environmental levels (P <.001, U = 107). By contrast, when drilling was conducted under OtoTent2, mean particle density remained at baseline. Adding a second suction inside OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 kept particle density at baseline levels. Significant aerosols were released upon removal of OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 despite a 60-second pause before drape removal after drilling (P <.001, U = 0, n = 10, 12; P <.001, U = 2, n = 12, 12, respectively). However, particle density did not increase above baseline when a second suction and a pause before removal were both employed. Conclusions: Mastoidectomy without a barrier, even when a second suction was added, generated substantial 1- to 10-µm aerosols. During drilling, large amounts of aerosols above baseline levels were detected with OtoTent1 but not OtoTent2. For both drapes, a second suction was an effective mitigation strategy during drilling. Last, the combination of a second suction and a pause before removal prevented aerosol escape during the removal of either drape. © The Author(s) 2020.","aerosol; aerosol generating procedure; aerosolization; airborne; barrier drape; COVID-19; health care providers; mastoidectomy; neurotology; otology; OtoTent; personal protective equipment; safety; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; virus transmission",,,"Otolaryngol.

Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal CoVs (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, United Kingdom. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70 000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently, and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity. © The Author(s) 2020.

ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in multiple organs, including the retina, an extension of the central nervous system. The ACE2 receptor is involved in the diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. Additionally, coronaviruses cause ocular infections in animals, including retinitis, and optic neuritis. Objective: To assess whether there is any retinal disease associated with COVID-19.

Little is known about the prevalence and pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children affected by SARS-CoV-2. Dehydration seems to be the most common trigger factor, and meticulous attention to fluid status is imperative. The principles of initiation, prescription, and complications related to renal replacement therapy are the same for coronavirus disease (COVID) patients as for non-COVID patients. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains the most common modality of treatment. When to initiate and what modality to use are dependent on the available resources. Though children are less often and less severely affected, diversion of all hospital resources to manage the adult surge might lead to limited CRRT resources. We describe how these shortages might be mitigated. Where machines are limited, one CRRT machine can be used for multiple patients, providing a limited number of hours of CRRT per day. In this case, increased exchange rates can be used to compensate for the decreased duration of CRRT. If consumables are limited, lower doses of CRRT (15-20 mL/kg/h) for 24 h may be feasible. Hypercoagulability leading to frequent filter clotting is an important issue in these children. Increased doses of unfractionated heparin, combination of heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation, or combination of prostacyclin and heparin might be used. If infusion pumps to deliver anticoagulants are limited, the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin might be considered. Alternatively in children, acute peritoneal dialysis can successfully control both fluid and metabolic disturbances. Intermittent hemodialysis can also be used in patients who are hemodynamically stable. The keys to successfully managing pediatric AKI in a pandemic are flexible use of resources, good understanding of dialysis techniques, and teamwork. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The primary objective of this scoping review is to synthesize current research of the diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), immunology tests, and computed tomography (CT) for the emergency department (ED) diagnosis of COVID-19. Secondary objectives included a synopsis of diagnostic biases likely with current COVID-19 research as well as corresponding implications of false-negative and false-positive results for clinicians and investigators. Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses–Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)–adherent synthesis of COVID-19 diagnostic accuracy through May 5, 2020, was conducted. The search strategy was designed by a medical librarian and included studies indexed by PubMed and Embase since January 2020. Results: A total of 1,907 citations were screened for relevance. Patients without COVID-19 are rarely reported, so specificity and likelihood ratios were generally unavailable. Fever is the most common finding, while hyposmia and hypogeusia appear useful to rule in COVID-19. Cough is not consistently present. Lymphopenia is the mostly commonly reported laboratory abnormality and occurs in over 50% of COVID-19 patients. rRT-PCR is currently considered the COVID-19 criterion standard for most diagnostic studies, but a single test sensitivity ranges from 60% to 78%. Multiple reasons for false-negatives rRT-PCR exist, including sample site tested and disease stage during which sample was obtained. CT may increase COVID-19 sensitivity in conjunction with rRT-PCR, but guidelines for imaging patients most likely to benefit are emerging. IgM and IgG serology levels are undetectable in the first week of COVID-19, but sensitivity (range = 82% to 100%) and specificity (range = 87% to 100%) are promising. Whether detectable COVID-19 antibodies correspond to immunity remains unanswered. Current studies do not adhere to accepted diagnostic accuracy reporting standards and likely report significantly biased results if the same tests were to be applied to general ED populations with suspected COVID-19. Conclusions: With the exception of fever and disorders of smell/taste, history and physical examination findings are unhelpful to distinguish COVID-19 from other infectious conditions that mimic SARS-CoV-2 like influenza. Routine laboratory tests are also nondiagnostic, although lymphopenia is a common finding and other abnormalities may predict severe disease. Although rRT-PCR is the current criterion standard, more inclusive consensus-based criteria will likely emerge because of the high false-negative rate of PCR tests. The role of serology and CT in ED assessments remains undefined. © 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine",,,"32542934","Acad. Emerg.

Simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination are presented in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Although the predictive model is broadly applicable, the simulations presented are based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe. The predictions of these models illustrate (1) why ambitious lock-down interventions to crush the curve represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into outright catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so stringently and for such extended periods, (3) why high prevalence of other pathogens causing similar symptoms to mild COVID-19 precludes the use of contact tracing as a substitute for lock down interventions to contain and eliminate epidemics, (4) why partial containment strategies intended to merely flatten the curve, by maintaining epidemics at manageably low levels, are grossly unrealistic, and (5) why local elimination may only be sustained after lock down ends if imported cases are comprehensively excluded, so international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries certified as free of COVID-19 represents the best strategy for motivating progress towards pandemic eradication at global level. The three sequential goals that every country needs to emphatically embrace are contain, eliminate and exclude. As recently emphasized by the World Health Organization, success will require widespread genuine national unity and unprecedented global solidarity. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Emerging infection; Epidemiology; Model; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; SARS2; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Zoonosis","Article; asymptomatic disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; disease eradication; disease severity; disease transmission; economics; epidemic; exposure; health care availability; health practitioner; herd immunity; human; incidence; infection control; intensive care unit; Ireland; major clinical study; mathematical model; mortality; pandemic; prediction; prevalence; prophylaxis; publishing; quarantine; simulation; social isolation; Tanzania",,"Infect.

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objective: To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant: This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course. Exposure: Cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Results: An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.

Detection of viral genomic materials by RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosis. Suspected COVID-19 patients who had a documented history of exposure and exhibited symptoms, but did not have positive PCR test results, were generally self-quarantined with prescriptions aiming to help attenuate their symptoms. These prescriptions are however neither specific nor highly effective for COVID-19 treatment. Given the rapidly growing pandemic and the overwhelmed medical system, the number of self-quarantined patients is increasing. There is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help patients relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and to potentially help increase their chances of survival and recovery from the infection. We report here a case of severe COVID-19 that never had a positive PCR test result during disease progression but was confirmed with antibody test post recovery. This patient was self-quarantined and received diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), a steroid-like molecule, in combination with vitamin C as alternative medicine.

AI-driven tools are used to identify Coronavirus outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread, where imaging techniques are widely used, such as CT scans and chest X-rays (CXRs). In this paper, motivated by the fact that X-ray imaging systems are more prevalent and cheaper than CT scan systems, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which we call Truncated Inception Net, is proposed to screen COVID-19 positive CXRs from other non-COVID and/or healthy cases. To validate our proposal, six different types of datasets were employed by taking the following CXRs: COVID-19 positive, Pneumonia positive, Tuberculosis positive, and healthy cases into account. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.96% (AUC of 1.0) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia and healthy cases. Similarly, it achieved an accuracy of 99.92% (AUC of 0.99) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and healthy CXRs. To the best of our knowledge, as of now, the achieved results outperform the existing AI-driven tools for screening COVID-19 using the acquired CXRs, and proves the viability of using the proposed Truncated Inception Net as a screening tool. © 2020, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.","Chest X-rays; CNN; COVID-19; Deep learning; Inception net; Pneumonia; Tuberculosis","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Diseases; Chest x-rays; Coronaviruses; Screening tool; Short periods; X ray imaging system; Computerized tomography",,"Phys.

However, in 2020 the threat of extremely contagious SARS CoV-2 or COVID-19 in Indonesia emerged, which has infected more than 100.303 persons by July 28, 2020, and expected to grow exponentially except if very strict measures were implemented. There are similar symptoms and laboratory findings with both dengue fever and COVID-19, paving way to dangerous possibilities such as incorrect or delayed initial treatment. This is especially worrisome in the context of the pandemic, where COVID-19 positive patients must be promptly identified, isolated and contact-traced, and eluded diagnosis might possibly endanger communities and healthcare workers. We present cases of patients who initially presented with symptoms and laboratory findings of dengue fever, including positive NS1 and/or IgM serology results. During the course of illness these patients fail to show characteristic dengue symptoms, and two cases begin to show respiratory symptoms. Upon further investigation with chest X-ray or contact tracing, the patients were indicated for COVID-19 swab test, which yielded positive results. Repeat dengue IgM/IgG returned positive in one case, suggesting dengue coinfection; however in all other cases, the repeat testing returned negative, suggesting that the initial serologies were false positives. These cases highlight the importance of comprehensively studying patients with apparent dengue fever symptoms and serology, and using the appropriate adjuvant test according to the course of the disease, since a serological overlap may exist between the two diseases. © 2020","Case series; COVID-19; Dengue fever; Serology",,,"IDCases",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089266721

Objective: To describe the epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a children's hospital and to compare these parameters between patients hospitalized with and without severe disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective review of electronic medical records from a tertiary care academically affiliated children's hospital in New York City, New York, included hospitalized children and adolescents (≤21 years) who were tested based on suspicion for COVID-19 between March 1 to April 15, 2020, and had positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe disease as defined by the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 50 patients, 27 (54%) were boys and 25 (50%) were Hispanic. The median days from onset of symptoms to admission was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-5 days). Most patients (40 [80%]) had fever or respiratory symptoms (32 [64%]), but 3 patients (6%) with only gastrointestinal tract presentations were identified. Obesity (11 [22%]) was the most prevalent comorbidity. Respiratory support was required for 16 patients (32%), including 9 patients (18%) who required mechanical ventilation. One patient (2%) died. None of 14 infants and 1 of 8 immunocompromised patients had severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation in children 2 years or older (6 of 9 [67%] vs 5 of 25 [20%]; P =.03). Lymphopenia was commonly observed at admission (36 [72%]) but did not differ significantly between those with and without severe disease. Those with severe disease had significantly higher C-reactive protein (median, 8.978 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10] vs 0.64 mg/dL) and procalcitonin levels (median, 0.31 ng/mL vs 0.17 ng/mL) at admission (P <.001), as well as elevated peak interleukin 6, ferritin, and D-dimer levels during hospitalization. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients (30%) but could not be completed for 3. Prolonged test positivity (maximum of 27 days) was observed in 4 patients (8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study of children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease had diverse manifestations. Infants and immunocompromised patients were not at increased risk of severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with disease severity.

More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general seasonal flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. As there are no distinctive COVID-19 positive case detection tools available, the need for supporting diagnostic tools has increased. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them, a critical approach for treatment is radiologic imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Application of Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful in the accurate identification of this disease, and can also be supportive in overcoming the issue of a shortage of trained physicians in remote communities. In this article, we have introduced a VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group, also called OxfordNet) Network-based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R–CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using an available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%. Therefore, we believe this proposed method might be of assistance for health professionals to validate their initial assessment towards COVID-19 patients. © 2020 The Author(s)","Chest X-Ray image; COVID-19; Deep neural network; Faster R–CNN; Novel coronavirus",,,"Inform.

Methods: In order to retrieve the data, we built a Python software program that provides access to Google Trends data via an application program interface. Daily COVID-19 case data for subregions of the five countries selected were retrieved from respective national health authorities. We sought to assess the association between raw search interest data and COVID-19 new daily cases per million for all regions individually. Results: In total, we yielded 2188 sets of Google Trends data which included 548 time series of 4 anosmia and ageusia search concepts over the study period for 137 regions. These data indicated that differences in search interest for terms relating to anosmia and ageusia, between regions, is associated with geographical trends in new Covid-19 cases.

Two patients presented important respiratory discomfort and eventually died. One was 69 years old and had severe coronary disease. She rapidly worsened after COVID-19 diagnosis on 9th postoperative day. The other was 67 years old with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, who experienced prolonged postoperative course, complicated with cytomegalovirus infection and kidney failure.

Understanding the Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is essential for interrupting viral infectivity and preventing aberrant immune responses before a vaccine can be developed. In this review, we provide the latest insights into the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and Ang II receptor-1 (AT1-R) in this disease. Novel therapeutic strategies, including recombinant ACE2, ACE inhibitors, AT1-R blockers, and Ang 1-7 peptides, may prevent or reduce viruses-induced pulmonary, cardiac, and renal injuries. However, more studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapeutics. Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals. In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19. Since the combination of MTX and baricitinib leads to outstanding clinical outcomes, the addition of baricitinib to MTX might be a potential strategy. © 2020 © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: From 27 March to 4 April 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Results: Two-hundred pairs of samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28–48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% (95% CI 60.4%–96.6%), and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%–99.9%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (κ coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723–0.979; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Saliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance. © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","Coronavirus disease 2019; Nasopharyngeal swab; RT-PCR; Saliva; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Throat swab",,"32422408","Clin.

Hence, exploring the involvement of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in these patients is of interest. Objectives: To illustrate the incidence of criteria (lupus anticoagulant [LAC], anticardiolipin [aCL] immunoglobulin G [IgG]/IgM, antibeta2-glycoprotein I antibodies [aβ2GPI] IgG/IgM) and noncriteria (anti-phosphatidyl serine/prothrombin [aPS/PT], aCL, and aβ2GPI IgA) aPL in a consecutive cohort of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients, their association with thrombosis, antibody profile and titers of aPL. Patients/Methods: Thirty-one consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit were included. aPL were measured at one time point, with part of the aPL-positive patients retested after 1 month. Results: Sixteen patients were single LAC-positive, two triple-positive, one double-positive, one single aCL, and three aCL IgG and LAC positive. Seven of nine thrombotic patients had at least one aPL. Sixteen of 22 patients without thrombosis were aPL positive, amongst them two triple positives. Nine of 10 retested LAC-positive patients were negative on a second occasion, as well as the double-positive patient. Seven patients were aPS/PT-positive associated to LAC. Three patients were aCL and aβ2GPI IgA-positive. Conclusion: Our observations support the frequent single LAC positivity during (acute phase) observed in COVID-19 infection; however, not clearly related to thrombotic complications. Triple aPL positivity and high aCL/aβ2GPI titers are rare. Repeat testing suggests aPL to be mostly transient. Further studies and international registration of aPL should improve understanding the role of aPL in thrombotic COVID-19 patients. © 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","antibodies; antiphospholipid; antiphospholipid syndrome; COVID-19; lupus anticoagulant; thrombosis",,"32619328","J.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is associated with central nervous system disease. We describe central nervous system manifestations in critical patients with COVID-19 at our tertiary center. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of all actively critical patients with COVID-19 admitted to our tertiary care academic center in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 22, 2020, with new onset of neurologic disease. Patients were grouped into 1 of 3 categories according to imaging and clinical features; encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and vasculopathy. Results: A total of 27 of 76 (35.5%) critical patients with COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. Twenty patients (74%) were designated with COVID-19–associated encephalopathy, 2 (7%) with COVID-19–associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and 5 (19%) with COVID-19–associated vasculopathy. Sixty-three percent of neurologic findings were demonstrated on computed tomography, 30% on magnetic resonance imaging, and 44% on electroencephalography. Findings most often included ischemic strokes, diffuse hypoattenuation, subcortical parenchymal hemorrhages, and focal hypodensities within deep structures. Magnetic resonance imaging findings included diffuse involvement of deep white matter, the corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. For patients with large-territory ischemic stroke, all but one displayed irregular proximal focal stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. Conclusions: Analysis of active critical COVID-19 admissions at our revealed a high percentage of patients with new neurologic disease. Although variable, presentations followed 1 of 3 broad categories. A better understanding of the neurologic sequalae and radiographic findings will help clinicians mitigate the impact of this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebrovascular disease; Infectious disease; Neurologic surgery; SAR-CoV-2",,"32474092","World Neurosurg.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086908494

While chest computed tomography (CT) plays an indispensable role in its diagnosis, the quantification and localization of lesions cannot be accurately assessed manually. We employed deep learning-based software to aid in detection, localization and quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A total of 2460 RT-PCR tested SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (1250 men and 1210 women; mean age, 57.7 ± 14.0 years (age range, 11–93 years) were retrospectively identified from Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 11 to March 16, 2020. Basic clinical characteristics were reviewed. The uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System was used to assess the CT scans. Results: CT scans of 2215 patients (90%) showed multiple lesions of which 36 (1%) and 50 patients (2%) had left and right lung infections, respectively (> 50% of each affected lung’s volume), while 27 (1%) had total lung infection (> 50% of the total volume of both lungs). Overall, 298 (12%), 778 (32%) and 1300 (53%) patients exhibited pure ground glass opacities (GGOs), GGOs with sub-solid lesions and GGOs with both sub-solid and solid lesions, respectively. Moreover, 2305 (94%) and 71 (3%) patients presented primarily with GGOs and sub-solid lesions, respectively. Elderly patients (≥ 60 years) were more likely to exhibit sub-solid lesions. The generalized linear mixed model showed that the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe was the favoured site of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: Chest CT combined with analysis by the uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System can accurately evaluate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2019 novel coronavirus; Artificial intelligence (AI); Computed tomography (CT); Ground glass opacity (GGO); Viral pneumonia",,,"Eur.

Orthopedic surgery involves procedures generating droplets and aerosols and there is concern amongst surgeons that otherwise rational precautionary principles are being set aside due to lack of scientific evidence and a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This narrative review attempts to translate relevant knowledge into practical recommendations for healthcare workers involved in orthopedic surgery on patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Patients and methods — We unsystematically searched in PubMed, reference lists, and the WHO’s web page for relevant publications concerning problems associated with the PPE used in perioperative practice when a patient is COVID-19 positive or suspected to be. A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3. Results — Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice. Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks. Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown. Interpretation — Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available. Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Because COVID-19 is extremely transmissible and can progress to a severe form of respiratory failure, the potential to overwhelm available critical care resources is high and critical care management of COVID-19 patients has been thrust into the spotlight. COVID-19 arrived in the United States in January and, as anticipated, has dramatically increased the usage of critical care resources. Three of the hardest-hit cities have been Seattle, New York City, and Chicago with a combined total of over 14,000 cases as of March 23, 2020.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of vulnerable populations, such as those with gynecologic cancer who develop COVID-19 infections, is limited. Methods: Patients from 6 NYC-area hospital systems with known gynecologic cancer and a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Demographic and clinical outcome data were abstracted through a review of electronic medical records. Results: Records for 121 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID-19 were abstracted; the median age at the COVID-19 diagnosis was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 51.0-73.0 years). Sixty-six of the 121 patients (54.5%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients, 45 (68.2%) required respiratory intervention, 20 (30.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 9 (13.6%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen patients (14.0%) died of COVID-19 complications. No patient requiring mechanical ventilation survived. On multivariable analysis, hospitalization was associated with an age ≥64 years (risk ratio [RR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.51), African American race (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13-2.15), and 3 or more comorbidities (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.03-1.98). Only recent immunotherapy use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.08-11.27) was associated with death due to COVID-19 on multivariable analysis; chemotherapy treatment and recent major surgery were not predictive of COVID-19 severity or mortality. Conclusions: The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a COVID-19 infection is 14.0%. Recent immunotherapy use is associated with an increased risk of mortality related to COVID-19 infection. Lay Summary: The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is 14.0%; there is no association between cytotoxic chemotherapy and cancer-directed surgery and COVID-19 severity or death.

The disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The Italian government declared a state of emergency on 31st January 2020 and on 11th March World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Although the COVID-19 incidence remained considerably lower in Sardinia than in the North Italy regions, which were the most affected, the field of prenatal screening and diagnosis was modified because of the emerging pandemic. Data on COVID-19 during pregnancy are so far limited. Since the beginning of the emergency, our Ob/Gyn Department at Microcitemico Hospital, Cagliari offered to pregnant patients all procedures considered essential by the Italian Ministry of Health. To evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activities of our center, we compared the number of procedures performed from 10th March to 18th May 2020 with those of 2019. Despite the continuous local birth rate decline, during the 10-week pandemic period, we registered a 20% increment of 1st trimester combined screening and a slight rise of the number of invasive prenatal procedures with a further increase in chorionic villi sampling compared to amniocentesis. Noninvasive prenatal testing remained unvariated. The request for multifetal pregnancy reduction as a part of the growing tendency of voluntary termination of pregnancy in Sardinia increased. The COVID-19 pandemic provides many scientific opportunities for clinical research and study of psychological and ethical issues in pregnant women. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","chorionic villous sampling; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); fetal cell-free DNA; non-invasive prenatal screening; nuchal translucency; prenatal screening diagnosis; quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"32628637","J.

However, most of these are single-center studies with a limited number of patients. To better assess the outcomes of this new infection in this subgroup of susceptible patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on cancer patients. We performed a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies that reported the risk of infection and complications of COVID-19 in cancer patients and retrieved 22 studies (1018 cancer patients). The analysis showed that the frequency of cancer among patients with confirmed COVID-19 was 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–3) in the overall cohort. These patients had a mortality of 21.1% (95% CI: 14.7–27.6), severe/critical disease rate of 45.4% (95% CI: 37.4–53.3), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate of 14.5% (95% CI: 8.5–20.4), and mechanical ventilation rate of 11.7% (95% CI: 5.5–18). The double-arm analysis showed that cancer patients had a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.71–6.13), severe/critical disease (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.70–5.67), ICU admission (OR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.85–5.17), and mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.27–18.65) than non-cancer patients. Furthermore, cancer patients had significantly lower platelet levels and higher D-dimer levels, C-reactive protein levels, and prothrombin time. In conclusion, these results indicate that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection-related complications. Therefore, cancer patients need diligent preventive care measures and aggressive surveillance for earlier detection of COVID-19 infection. © 2020 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre","Cancer; COVID-19; Mechanical ventilation; Meta-analysis; Mortality",,"32745466","Hematol.

The goal of our study was to analyze, in a retrospective cohort study, the results of gynecological cancer surgery and evaluate postoperative complications in a single center in one of the most affected areas in Europe. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who were referred between March 2020 and May 2020 for primary surgical treatment of breast, endometrial, ovarian, cervical, or vulvar cancer. Results: The study included a total of 126 patients. Median age was 60 years (range 29-89). Patients were referred with breast (76/126, 60.3%), endometrial (29/126, 23%), ovarian (14/126, 11.1%), cervical (5/126, 4%), or vulvar cancer (2/126, 1.6%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was only conducted in 50% of cases due to the low availability of tests during the first phase of our study, and was indicated only in suspected cases according to the healthcare authorities' protocol. Median hospital stay was 1 day (range 0-18). Excluding breast surgery, laparoscopy was the most used procedure (43/126, 34.1%). 15 patients had a postoperative complication (15/126, 11.9%); only in 2 patients (2/15 13.3%) were there reports of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or 4 complications. 6 patients tested positive for COVID-19 following a PCR diagnostic test, and these surgeries were cancelled.

Objective: To investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the environmental surfaces of an ophthalmology examination room after visits by patients who were asymptomatic and had passed COVID-19 triage. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a quality improvement study conducted 1 week after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 case in İzmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, İzmir, Turkey, on March 20, 2020. A triage system was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 from patients who were asymptomatic and presented for examination in an ophthalmology clinic. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing was used to detect the presence of viral RNA material in samples from the biomicroscope stage, slitlamp breath shield, phoropter, tonometer, and door handles. The first group of samples was taken before the beginning of the examinations, and the second group of the samples was taken after the last patient had left the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the presence of viral material on surfaces in 5 circular zones with a diameter of 1 m each around where the patients sat. Results: Thirty-one persons visited the room, of whom 22 underwent ophthalmic examination and 9 were companions. The mean (SD) examination time was 9 (4) minutes (range, 5-13 minutes). Seven samples were taken before examinations and 7 after examinations. Two samples that were taken after examinations were found to be positive for COVID-19, 1 from the slitlamp breath shield and 1 from the phoropter. Conclusions and Relevance: This study showed the presence of COVID-19 viral material in a circle 1 m in diameter around where the patients sat.

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.

Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known. Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Case Presentations: Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam. Discussion: Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury. However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the blood–brain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions. The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established. Conclusions: Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease. These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood–brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection. Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.","Coronavirus; Seizures; Status epilepticus",,,"Neurocrit.

Ramping up the testing capacity of a country supposes an essential public health response to this new outbreak. A pool testing strategy where multiple samples are tested in a single reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit could potentially increase a country's testing capacity. The aim of this study is to propose a simple mathematical model to estimate the optimum number of pooled samples according to the relative prevalence of positive tests in a particular healthcare context, assuming that if a group tests negative, no further testing is done whereas if a group tests positive, all the subjects of the group are retested individually. The model predicts group sizes that range from 11 to 3 subjects. For a prevalence of 10% of positive tests, 40.6% of tests can be saved using testing groups of four subjects. For a 20% prevalence, 17.9% of tests can be saved using groups of three subjects. For higher prevalences, the strategy flattens and loses effectiveness. Pool testing individuals for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a valuable strategy that could considerably boost a country's testing capacity. However, further studies are needed to address how large these groups can be, without losing sensitivity on the RT-PCR. The strategy best works in settings with a low prevalence of positive tests. It is best implemented in subgroups with low clinical suspicion. The model can be adapted to specific prevalences, generating a tailored to the context implementation of the pool testing strategy. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","coronavirus; modeling; pool testing; public health; strategy",,"32330297","J.

Methods: For this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed on the basis of a training set consisting of 136 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 103 patients with other types of viral pneumonia. Radiomics features were extracted from the lung parenchyma window. A radiomics signature was built on the basis of reproducible features, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO). Multivariable logistic regression model was adopted to establish a radiomics nomogram. Nomogram performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The model was validated in 90 consecutive patients, of which 56 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and 34 patients had other types of viral pneumonia. Results: The radiomics signature, consisting of 3 selected features, was significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia (p < 0.05) in both training and validation sets. The multivariable logistic regression model included the radiomics signature and distribution; maximum lesion, hilar, and mediastinal lymph node enlargement; and pleural effusion. The individualized prediction nomogram showed good discrimination in the training sample (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.959; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.933–0.985) and in the validation sample (AUC, 0.955; 95% CI, 0.899–0.995) and good calibration. The mixed model achieved better predictive efficacy than the clinical model. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusions: The radiomics model derived has good performance for predicting COVID-19 pneumonia and may help in clinical decision-making. Key Points: • A radiomics model showed good performance for prediction 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and favorable discrimination for other types of pneumonia on CT images. • A central or peripheral distribution, a maximum lesion range > 10 cm, the involvement of all five lobes, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and no pleural effusion is associated with an increased risk of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. • A radiomics model was superior to a clinical model in predicting 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronavirus infections; Pneumonia, viral; Radiomics, nomograms; Thorax; Tomography, x-ray computed",,"32621237","Eur.

All have associations with human central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. In infants and young children, the most common CNS phenomena are febrile seizures; in adults, non-focal abnormalities that may be either neurologic or constitutional. Neurotropism and neurovirulence are dependent in part on CNS expression of cell surface receptors mediating viral entry, and host immune response. In adults, CNS receptors for epidemic viruses are largely expressed on brain vasculature, whereas receptors for less pathogenic viruses are present in vasculature, brain parenchyma, and olfactory neuroepithelium, dependent upon viral species. Human coronaviruses can infect circulating mononuclear cells, but meningoencephalitis is rare. Well-documented human neuropathologies are infrequent and, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, can entail cerebrovascular accidents originating extrinsically to brain. There is evidence of neuronal infection in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates with SARS-CoV, and CSF studies of rare patients with seizures have demonstrated virus but no pleocytosis. In contrast to human disease, animal models of neuropathogenesis are well developed, and pathologies including demyelination, neuronal necrosis, and meningoencephalitis are seen with both native CoVs as well as human CoVs inoculated into nasal cavities or brain. This review covers basic CoV biology pertinent to CNS disease; the spectrum of clinical abnormalities encountered in infants, children, and adults; and the evidence for CoV infection of human brain, with reference to pertinent animal models of neuropathogenesis. © 2020, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.","Central nervous system; Coronavirus; Neurologic disease",,,"J.

In this review article, we highlighted the importance of AI and Machine learning (ML) techniques that can speed up the path to the discovery of a possible cure for COVID-19. We also deal with the interactions between viromics and AI, which can hopefully find a solution to this pandemic. Evidence Acquisition: A review of different articles was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for recent studies regarding the use of AI, seeking the spread of different infectious diseases using relevant MeSH subheadings. Results: After a thorough screening of different articles, 30 articles were considered, and key information was obtained from them. Finally, the scope was broadened to obtain more information. Our findings indicated that AI/ML is a promising approach to drug development. Conclusions: The field of AI has enormous potential to predict the changes that may take place in the environment. If this technology is applied to situations of a pandemic such as COVID-19, breakthroughs could potentially pave the way for new vaccines and antiviral drugs. © 2020, Author(s).","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Spike Glycoprotein","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; drug development; gene mutation; human; machine learning; omics; pandemic; phylogenetic tree; protein protein interaction; recurrent neural network; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; thorax radiography; truncated back propagation through time; viromics; virus detection; virus entry",,"Arch.

In this study, we explored the epidemiological characteristics, clinical patterns, and laboratory and imaging findings of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: From March 7 to March 30, 2020, there were a total of 35 patients who had confirmed COVID-19 infection by laboratory virus nucleic acid test (RT-PCR) assay with throat swab samples or typical chest CT manifestation compatible with COVID-19, in addition to a history of close contact with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in family members. Information recorded included demographic data, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments, severity of disease, treatment, and mortality. Results: The median age of the patients was 7.5 years (IQR=4–11; range=4 months to 15 years). A total of 63% were male. Cough was present in 80% of the patients, followed by fever (77%), nausea or vomiting (29%), diarrhea (26%), shortness of breath (29%), headache (20%), and myalgia (14%). Lymphopenia was present in 43% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 9%, neutopenia in 8%, and leucopenia in 26%. We reported severe pneumonia in 40% of the hospitalized patients and 18 (51%) had underlying diseases. Of 35 patients, 11 had positive RT-PCR results (31%). The chest CT images of 24 patients (69%) suggested COVID-19, while their RT-PCR assays from throat swab samples were negative. Conclusion: This study demonstrates different clinical findings of pediatrics compared to the previous reports of children. Since a high rate of false negative RT-PCR test was observed, early detection of children with COVID-19 infection by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment. © 2020 Mahmoudi et al.","Children; COVID-19; Iran; Severe pneumonia","azithromycin; cephalosporin derivative; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; vancomycin; adolescent; age; Article; child; child health care; childhood mortality; clinical article; clinical examination; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; demography; diarrhea; disease severity; dyspnea; early diagnosis; early intervention; false negative result; family; female; fever; headache; hospital patient; human; infant; Iranian people; laboratory test; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; male; medical history; myalgia; nausea and vomiting; neutropenia; pediatric hospital; pneumonia; preschool child; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex ratio; symptom; throat culture; thrombocytopenia",,"Infect.

Material and Methods: The hood has iris-port openings for access to the patient, and an opening large enough for a patient's head and upper torso. The top of the hood is a high-efficiency particulate air filter connected to a blower to apply negative pressure. We determined the aerosol penetration from outside to inside in laboratory experiments. Results: The penetration of particles from within the hood to the breathing zones of HCWs outside the hood was near 10-4 (0.01%) in the 200-400 nm size range, and near 10−3 (0.1%) for smaller particles. Penetration values for particles in the 500 nm-5 μm range were below 10−2 (1%). Fluorometric analysis of deposited fluorescein particles on the personal protective equipment of an HCW revealed that negative pressure reduces particle deposition both outside and inside the hood. Conclusions: We find that negative pressure hoods can be effective controls to mitigate aerosol exposure to HCWs, while simultaneously allowing access to patients. © 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.","Aerosol based disease transmission; HEPA air filtration; Nosocomial infection",,"32603849","Am.

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV. © 2020 eScholarship.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (&gt;50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance.1When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation, the outcome is poor,2-4and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually 2 or 3 weeks.2In this article, the authors review several technological devices, which could support health care providers at the bedside to optimize the care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralyzed, and ventilated. Particular attention is provided to the use of videolaryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting health care providers from this viral infection. Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train-of-four monitors which are utilized to better administer neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources. COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU. This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation. The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue, and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including (a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all health care givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; (b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point-of-care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; (c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and thromboelastography (TEG); (d) adapting the use of anesthetic machines and the use of volatile anesthetics. Implementing technologies for safeguarding health care providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources are paramount. Only by leveraging new technologies, it will be possible to sustain and support health care systems during the expected long course of this pandemic. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral–fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology.

We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya. Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifi county hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya. Children aged <5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity. Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one HCoV type. There were 129 (41.1%) OC43, 99 (31.5%) 229E, 74 (23.6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3.8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection. Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens. The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged <1 year (66%, n=208), though there was no age-dependence in the proportion testing positive. HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period. Evidence for seasonality was not identified. Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, with no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i.e. highest in infants). These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into the potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Otieno GP et al.","Human coronavirus; NL63; OC43, 229E",,,"Wellcome Open Res.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087755248

Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and digestive tract diseases, several coronaviruses are responsible for porcine diarrhea, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and emerging swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Those viruses have caused huge economic losses and are considered as potential public health threats. Porcine torovirus (PToV) and coronaviruses, sharing similar genomic structure and replication strategy, belong to the same order Nidovirales. Here, we developed a multiplex TaqMan-probe-based real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of PEDV, PDCoV, PToV, and SADS-CoV for the first time. Specific primers and TaqMan fluorescent probes were designed targeting the ORF1a region of PDEV, PToV, and SADS-CoV and the ORF1b region of PDCoV. The method showed high sensitivity and specificity, with a detection limit of 1 × 102 copies/μL for each pathogen. A total of 101 clinical swine samples with signs of diarrhea were analyzed using this method, and the result showed good consistency with conventional reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). This method improves the efficiency for surveillance of these emerging and reemerging swine enteric viruses and can help reduce economic losses to the pig industry, which also benefits animal and public health. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. Results: A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5‰ (95% CI: 0.31‰–4.37‰).

We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into β-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019. As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola er virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for its effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. © 2020 PAGEPress Publications.

The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

How to objectively and quantitatively differentiate pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 virus remains clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To formulate standardized scoring criteria and an objective quantization standard to guide decision making in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus induced pneumonia in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective dataset includes computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 43 pneumonia patients with COVID-19 virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 49 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 virus. All patients were treated during the same time period in two hospitals. Key indicators of differential diagnosis were identified in relevant literature and the scores were quantified namely, patients with more than 8 points were identified as high risk, those with 6-8 points as moderate risk, and those with fewer than 6 points as low risk for COVID-19 virus. In the study, 3 radiologists determined the scores for all patients. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were determined as high risk, among which 42 were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR tests. Next, 9 were identified as moderate risk, one of whom was COVID-19 positive. Last, 22 were classified into the low-risk group, all of them are COVID-19 negative. Based on these results, the sensitivity of detection COVID-19 positive cases between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was 0.98 with 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.61 [0.46, 0.75]. The detection sensitivity between the moderate-/high-risk group and the low-risk group was 1.00 [0.92, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.45 [0.31, 0.60]. CONCLUSION: The proposed quantitative scoring criteria showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity in detecting COVID-19 using CT images, which indicates that these criteria may be beneficial for screening in real-world practice and helpful for long-term disease control. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

This study proposes a clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using CT features to automatically discriminate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: Overall, 612 patients (306 COVID-19 and 306 non-COVID-19 pneumonia) were recruited. Twenty radiological features were extracted from CT images to evaluate the pattern, location, and distribution of lesions of patients in both groups. All significant CT features were fed in five classifiers namely decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble to evaluate the best performing CAD system in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Results: Location and distribution pattern of involvement, number of the lesion, ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features to classify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. Our proposed CAD system obtained the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.965, 93.54%, 90.32%, and 91.94%, respectively, using ensemble (COVIDiag) classifier. Conclusions: This study proposed a COVIDiag model obtained promising results using CT radiological routine features. It can be considered an adjunct tool by the radiologists during the current COVID-19 pandemic to make an accurate diagnosis. Key Points: • Location and distribution of involvement, number of lesions, GGO and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features between COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. • The proposed CAD system, COVIDiag, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia cases with an AUC of 0.965 (sensitivity = 93.54%; specificity = 90.32%; and accuracy = 91.94%). • The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy obtained by radiologist diagnosis are 0.879, 87.10%, 88.71%, and 87.90%, respectively. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Machine learning; Pneumonia; Tomography, X-ray computed",,,"Eur.

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented. © 2020 The Authors","Basic reproduction number; Effective daily reproduction ratio; Emerging and reemerging pathogens; Mathematical modeling; Novel coronavirus","2019 novel coronavirus; Article; basic reproduction number; control strategy; coronavirus disease 2019; disease control; disease transmission; infectious agent; mathematical model; public health; risk factor; RNA virus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission",,"Infect.

This study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an immunochromatography-based assay of human serum for COVID-19. The present study enrolled 149 subjects who had been tested by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 and were classified into two groups: 70 who were positive for COVID-19 and 79 who were negative for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR. An immunochromatography-based COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglobulin M (IgM) rapid test on the sera of the study population was applied to measure the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve compared to RT-PCR, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). IgM or IgG antibodies were detected in 65 subjects (92.9%) classified as positive for COVID-19 and in three subjects (3.8%) classified as negative for COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity percentages for IgM or IgG antibodies were 92.9% (95% CI: 84.1-97.6) and 96.2% (95% CI: 89.3-99.2), respectively, with 95.6% PPV and 93.8% NPV. The PPV rapidly improved with increasing disease prevalence from 19.8% to 96.1% in the presence of either IgM or IgG, while the NPV remained high with a change from 99.9% to 93.1%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.945 (95% CI: 0.903-0.988) for subjects with either IgM or IgG positivity. In conclusion, the immunochromatography-based COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test is a useful and practical diagnostic assay for detection of COVID-19, especially in the presence of IgM or IgG antibodies. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronavirus; COVID-19; immunochromatography; real-time polymerase chain reaction",,"32458479","J.

This reduced capacity, along with public reluctance to undergo endoscopy during the pandemic, might result in excess mortality from delayed cancer diagnosis. Using the UK's National Endoscopy Database (NED), we performed the first national analysis of the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services and endoscopic cancer diagnosis. Design: We developed a NED COVID-19 module incorporating procedure-level data on all endoscopic procedures. Three periods were designated: pre-COVID (6 January 2020 to 15 March), transition (16-22 March) and COVID-impacted (23 March-31 May). National, regional and procedure-specific analyses were performed. The average weekly number of cancers, proportion of missing cancers and cancer detection rates were calculated. Results: A weekly average of 35 478 endoscopy procedures were performed in the pre-COVID period. Activity in the COVID-impacted period reduced to 12% of pre-COVID levels; at its low point, activity was only 5%, recovering to 20% of pre-COVID activity by study end. Although more selective vetting significantly increased the per-procedure cancer detection rate (pre-COVID 1.91%; COVID-impacted 6.61%; p<0.001), the weekly number of cancers detected decreased by 58%. The proportion of missing cancers ranged from 19% (pancreatobiliary) to 72% (colorectal). Conclusion: This national analysis demonstrates the remarkable impact that the pandemic has had on endoscopic services, which has resulted in a substantial and concerning reduction in cancer detection. Major, urgent efforts are required to restore endoscopy capacity to prevent an impending cancer healthcare crisis. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

METHODS: The sources of information used by the epidemiological surveillance of the municipality for COVID-19 were identified and the temporal distribution and interval for detection of confirmed cases of the disease were analyzed. RESULTS: The city's epidemiological surveillance uses outpatient, hospital, public and private laboratory notifications as data sources. For reporting COVID-19 cases in official information systems, there is also an active search of laboratory results linked to suspected deaths investigated. From January to April 2020, 1,449 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 were reported, the first case being detected in late February 2020. Of the total 1,025 laboratory samples of cases hospitalized after the 8th epidemiological week, 87 (8.5%) of COVID-19 cases were confirmed. The median time between the onset of symptoms and the release of laboratory results was 12 days for the analyzed period. CONCLUSION: Epidemiological surveillance uses several data sources to monitor and analyze the transmission of COVID-19. The timeliness of this system to detect cases of the disease is compromised by the delay in the release of laboratory results, which has been a considerable challenge for adequate surveillance.",,,"32785450","Rev Bras Epidemiol",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089408184

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is the preferred method of diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Yet, chest CT is often used in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 due to regional preferences, lack of availability of PCR assays, and false-negative PCR assays, as well as for monitoring of disease progression, complications, and treatment response. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) organized a webinar to discuss CT practice and protocol optimization from a radiation protection perspective on April 9, 2020, and surveyed participants from five continents. We review important aspects of CT in COVID-19 infection from the justification of its use to specific scan protocols for optimizing radiation dose and diagnostic information. Key Points • Chest CT provides useful information in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. • When indicated, chest CT in most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia must be performed with non-contrast, low-dose protocol. • Although chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, CT findings are non-specific and overlap with other viral infections including influenza and H1N1. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","COVID-19; Pandemics; Radiation protection; Tomography, X-ray computed",,"32621238","Eur.

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through April 04, 2020, for published English language studies. Studies were eligible if they included immunocompetent patients with up to 14 days of viral pneumonia. Subjects had a respiratory tract sample test positive for COVID-19, adenovirus, influenza A, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus. We only included observational studies and case series with more than ten patients. The pooled prevalence of each chest CT pattern or finding was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: From 2263 studies identified, 33 were eligible for inclusion, with a total of 1911 patients (COVID-19, n = 934; non-COVID, n = 977). Frequent CT features for both COVID-19 and non-COVID viral pneumonia were a mixed pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation (COVID-19, 0.37; 0.17–0.56; non-COVID, 0.46; 0.35–0.58) or predominantly GGO pattern (COVID-19, 0.42; 0.28–0.55; non-COVID 0.25; 0.17–0.32), bilateral distribution (COVID-19, 0.81; 0.77–0.85; non-COVID, 0.69; 0.54–0.84), and involvement of lower lobes (COVID-19, 0.88; 0.80–0.95; non-COVID, 0.61; 0.50–0.82). COVID-19 pneumonia presented a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution (COVID-19 0.77; 0.67–0.87; non-COVID 0.34; 0.18–0.49), and involvement of upper (COVID-19, 0.77; 0.65–0.88; non-COVID 0.18; 0.10–0.27) and middle lobes (COVID-19, 0.61; 0.47–0.76; non-COVID 0.24; 0.11–0.38). Conclusion: Except for a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution, involvement of upper and middle lobes, COVID-19, and non-COVID viral pneumonia had overlapping chest CT findings. Key Points: • Most common CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were a predominant pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO), followed by a mixed pattern of GGO and consolidation, bilateral disease, peripheral distribution, and lower lobe involvement. • Most frequent CT findings of non-COVID viral pneumonia were a predominantly mixed pattern of GGO and consolidation, followed by a predominant pattern of GGO, bilateral disease, random or diffuse distribution, and lower lobe involvement. • COVID-19 pneumonia presented a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution, and involvement of upper and middle lobes compared with non-COVID viral pneumonia. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Computed tomography; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Viral pneumonia; X-ray",,,"Eur.

Methods: Three hundred and fourteen patients presented with clinically suspected COVID-19, from March 3 to 23, 2020, were evaluated with PaO2/FIO2 ratio from arterial blood gas, RT-PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swab sample and chest CT. Patients were classified as COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive according to RT-PCR results, considered as a reference. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the RT-PCR results and classified as “CT positive” or “CT negative” for COVID-19, according to CT findings. Results: According to RT-PCR results, 152 patients were COVID-19 negative (48%) and 162 were COVID-19 positive (52%). We found substantial agreement between RT-PCR results and CT findings (p < 0.000001), as well as an almost perfect agreement between the two readers. Mixed GGO and consolidation pattern with peripheral and bilateral distribution, multifocal or diffuse abnormalities localized in both upper lung and lower lung, in association with interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening and air bronchogram, showed higher frequency in COVID-positive patients. We also found a significant correlation between CT findings and patient’s oxygenation status expressed by PaO2/FIO2 ratio. Conclusion: Chest CT has a useful role in the early detection and in patient management of COVID-19 pneumonia in a pandemic. It helps in identifying suspected patients, cutting off the route of transmission and avoiding further spread of infection. © 2020, The Author(s).","Chest CT; COVID-19; Emergency radiology; Pandemic; Pneumonia",,,"Radiol.

Methods: We retrospectively collected chest CT exams including n = 498 on 151 unique patients RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and n = 497 unique patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Both COVID-19 and CAP image sets were partitioned into three groups for training, validation, and testing respectively. In an attempt to discriminate COVID-19 from CAP, we developed several classifiers based on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP. The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary. Results: One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56–0.85). This model allowed for the identification of 8–50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases. However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases. Key Points: • Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans. • ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms. • Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Biomarkers; COVID-19; Neural network; Pneumonia",,,"Eur.

While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases. Methods: We have analyzed all available data provided by the World Health Organization on the development of international COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers on March 17th, 2020. A crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) and adjusted case-fatality risk (aCFR) was calculated for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran and the United States. Additionally, a fold-change (FC) was derived for each country. Results: The highest aCFR and FC were detected for Spain. Based on their FC values, an extremely high number of undetected COVID-19 cases was displayed in France, the United States, Italy and Spain. For these countries, our findings indicate a detection rate of only 1–2% of total actual COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries. Our data indicate that countries like France, Italy, the United States, Iran and Spain have extremely high numbers of undetected and underreported cases. Differences in testing availability and capacity, containment as well as overall health care and medical infrastructure result in significantly different mortality rates and COVID-19 case numbers for each respective country. © 2020 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia","COVID-19; Death; Mortality; Pandemic; Rate; Spread",,,"Pulmonology",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086403769

Methods: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. Results: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin’s disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. Conclusion: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients’ awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts. © 2020, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.","Cancer; COVID-19; Hematology tumor; Solid tumor; Treatment",,,"Int.

However, the number of CTs performed in persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 has increased.

We aim to provide guidance to radiologists in reporting CT findings potentially attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, including standardized language to reduce reporting variability when addressing the possibility of COVID-19. When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection. These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia. In this setting, using the term ""viral pneumonia"" can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative. However, if one opts to use the term ""COVID-19"" in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language. In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide.

We aimed to develop a new classification and structured reporting system on CT imaging (COVID-19 S) that would facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the most accurate way.METHODS Our retrospective cohort included 803 patients with a chest CT scan upon suspicion of COVID-19. The patients’ history, physical examination, CT findings, RT-PCR, and other laboratory test results were reviewed, and a final diagnosis was made as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. Chest CT scans were classified according to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria. Cohen’s kappa analysis was used.RESULTS Final clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 in 98 patients (12%). According to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria, the number of patients in the normal, compatible with COVID-19, indeterminate and alternative diagnosis groups were 581 (72.3%), 97 (12.1%), 16 (2.0%) and 109 (13.6%). When the indeterminate group was combined with the group compatible with COVID-19, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 99.0% and 87.1%, with 85.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.1% negative predictive value (NPV). When the indeterminate group was combined with the alternative diagnosis group, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 93.9% and 96.0%, with 94.8% PPV and 95.2% NPV.CONCLUSION COVID-19 S CT classification system may meet the needs of radiologists in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies and help optimize patient management and disease control in this pandemic by the use of structured reporting. © Turkish Society of Radiology 2020.",,"hypochlorite sodium; adult; aged; Article; bronchiectasis; bronchopneumonia; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diagnostic test accuracy study; dyspnea; female; fever; human; interstitial pneumonia; laboratory test; lobar pneumonia; lung embolism; lung infiltrate; major clinical study; male; predictive value; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; classification; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test; differential diagnosis; genetics; isolation and purification; middle aged; pandemic; pathology; pneumonia; procedures; radiologist; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax; turkey (bird); virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiologists; Retrospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thorax; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Turkey","32558646","Diagn.

Methods: A deep learning algorithm consisted of lesion detection, segmentation, and location was trained and validated in 14,435 participants with chest CT images and definite pathogen diagnosis. The algorithm was tested in a non-overlapping dataset of 96 confirmed COVID-19 patients in three hospitals across China during the outbreak. Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists’ reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Results: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. While for per-lung lobe basis, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98) and a slightly inferior F1 score of 0.86. The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm3. An average running speed of 20.3 s ± 5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p &lt; 0.017). The deep learning algorithm can also assist radiologists make quicker diagnosis (all p &lt; 0.0001) with superior diagnostic performance. Conclusions: The algorithm showed excellent performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images compared with resident radiologists. Key Points: • The higher sensitivity of deep learning model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia were found compared with radiological residents on a per-lobe and per-patient basis. • The deep learning model improves diagnosis efficiency by shortening processing time. • The deep learning model can automatically calculate the volume of the lesions and whole lung. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","COVID-19; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Multidetector computed tomography; Pneumonia",,,"Eur.

We present a COVID-19 patient with refractory acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), and life-threatening PE who underwent successful thrombolysis. Case Presentation: A previously healthy 47 year old male was admitted to our hospital due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia [confirmed by Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR)]. He had rapidly evolving ARDS [partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen ratio: 175], and sepsis. Laboratory results showed lymphocytopenia, and increased D-dimer levels (7.7 μg/ml; normal: 0–0.5 μg/ml). The patient was treated in the intensive care unit. On day-1, ARDS-net/prone positioning ventilation, and empiric anti-COVID treatment integrating prophylactic anticoagulation was administered. On hospital day-2, the patient developed shock with worsening oxygenation. Point-of-care-ultrasound depicted a large thrombus migrating from the right atrium to the pulmonary circulation. Intravenous alteplase (100 mg over 2 h) was administered as rescue therapy. The patient made an uneventful recovery, and was discharged to home isolation (day-20) on oral rivaroxaban. Conclusion: Thrombolysis may have a critical therapeutic role for massive PE in COVID-19; however the risk of potential bleeding should not be underestimated.

Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. Objective: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. Material and methods: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D‑dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. Conclusion: We recommend the determination of D‑dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin.

Methods: Chest computed tomography (CT) studies in 303 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 were reviewed by 3 fellowship-trained chest radiologists. Cases were assigned an impression of typical, indeterminate, atypical, or negative for COVID-19 pneumonia according to the RSNA expert consensus statement reporting guidelines, and interobserver analysis was performed. Objective CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia and distribution of findings were recorded. Results: The Fleiss kappa for all observers was almost perfect for typical (0.815), atypical (0.806), and negative (0.962) COVID-19 appearances (P <.0001) and substantial (0.636) for indeterminate COVID-19 appearance (P <.0001). Using Cramer V analysis, there were very strong correlations between all radiologists’ interpretations, statistically significant for all (typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative) COVID-19 appearances (P <.001). Objective CT imaging findings were recorded in similar percentages of typical cases by all observers. Conclusion: The RSNA expert consensus statement on reporting chest CT findings related to COVID-19 demonstrates substantial to almost perfect interobserver agreement among chest radiologists in a relatively large cohort of patients with clinically suspected COVID-19. It therefore serves as a reliable reference framework for radiologists to accurately communicate their level of suspicion based on the presence of evidence-based objective findings. © The Author(s) 2020.","2019n-CoV; COVID-19; CT; lung diseases; pneumonia",,,"Can.

It is highly transmissible disease that can affect respiratory tract and can leads to organ failure. In 2020 it is declared by world health organization as “Public health emergency of international concerns”. The current situation of Covid-19 and chest related diseases have already gone through radical change with the advancements of image processing tools. There is no effective method which can accurately identify all chest related diseases and tackle the multiple class problems with reliable results. Method: There are many potentially impactful applications of Deep Learning to fighting the Covid-19 from Chest X-Ray/CT Images, however, most are still in their early stages due to lack of data sharing as it continues to inhibit overall progress in a variety of medical research problems. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, this work aims to detect the possibility of COVID-19 in the patient. This work provides a significant contribution in terms of Gan based synthetic data and four different types of deep learning-based models which provided state of the art comparable results. Results: A Deep Neural Network model provides a significant contribution in terms of detecting COVID-19 and provides effective analysis of chest related diseases with respect to age and gender.

When the first confirmed case was diagnosed, the Korean Center for Disease Control and Central Disaster Management Headquarters responded quickly, emphasizing early detection with numerous tests and a social distancing policy. This slowed the spread of infection without intensive containment, shut down, or mitigation interventions. After entering the public health blue alert level, a business continuity plan was distributed. After entering the orange level, the Ministry of Employment and Labor developed workplace guidelines for COVID-19 consisting of social distancing, flexible working schedules, early identification of workers with suspected infections, and disinfection of workplaces. Owing to the intensive workplace social distancing policy, workplaces remained safe with only small sporadic group infections. Conclusion: The workplace social distancing policy with timely implementation of specific guidelines was a key to preventing a large outbreak of COVID-19 in Korean workplaces. However, sporadic incidents of COVID-19 are still ongoing, and risk assessment in vulnerable workplaces should be continued. © 2020 The Author","COVID-19; Public health; Public health surveillance; Social distance; Workplace",,,"Saf.

Methods: 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. Results: The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25% female and 46.75% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic ‘bat wing sign’. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. Conclusion: There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza. © Belgian Society of Internal Medicine and Royal Belgian Society of Laboratory Medicine (2020).","clinical features; COVID-19 pneumonia; imaging features; influenza pneumonia",,"32723027","Acta Clin.

Hence, patients with CLL might be considered more susceptible to severe complications from COVID-19. We undertook this retrospective international multicenter study to characterize the course of COVID-19 in patients with CLL and identify potential predictors of outcome. Of 190 patients with CLL and confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed between 28/03/2020 and 22/05/2020, 151 (79%) presented with severe COVID-19 (need of oxygen and/or intensive care admission). Severe COVID-19 was associated with more advanced age (≥65 years) (odds ratio 3.72 [95% CI 1.79–7.71]). Only 60 patients (39.7%) with severe COVID-19 were receiving or had recent (≤12 months) treatment for CLL at the time of COVID-19 versus 30/39 (76.9%) patients with mild disease. Hospitalization rate for severe COVID-19 was lower (p < 0.05) for patients on ibrutinib versus those on other regimens or off treatment. Of 151 patients with severe disease, 55 (36.4%) succumbed versus only 1/38 (2.6%) with mild disease; age and comorbidities did not impact on mortality. In CLL, (1) COVID-19 severity increases with age; (2) antileukemic treatment (particularly BTK inhibitors) appears to exert a protective effect; (3) age and comorbidities did not impact on mortality, alluding to a relevant role of CLL and immunodeficiency. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,,"Leukemia",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087678355

The utility of chest radiography (CXR) remains an evolving topic of discussion. Current reports of CXR findings related to COVID-19 contain varied terminology as well as various assessments of its sensitivity and specificity. This can lead to a misunderstanding of CXR reports and makes comparison between examinations and research studies challenging. With this need for consistency, we propose language for standardized CXR reporting and severity assessment of persons under investigation for having COVID-19, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and patients who may have radiographic findings typical or suggestive of COVID-19 when the diagnosis is not suspected clinically. We recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection when typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR are present as an incidental finding. In addition, we summarize the currently available literature related to the use of CXR for COVID-19 and discuss the evolving techniques of obtaining CXR in COVID-19-positive patients. The recently published expert consensus statement on reporting chest computed tomography findings related to COVID-19, endorsed by the Radiological Society of North American (RSNA), the Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR), and American College of Radiology (ACR), serves as the framework for our proposal. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","chest radiograph; Coronavirus disease 2019; pneumonia; severity assessment; standardized reporting language",,"32520846","J.

In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p &lt;.001, CFI =.91, RMSEA =.032, SRMR =.055).

Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1β, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1β and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1β than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1β and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1β blockade in treatment of COVID-19. However, the source of the high levels of IL-6 remains to be determined. © 2020 The Authors.

Unlike elective surgery, acute care surgery (ACS) workloads cannot be artificially reduced providing a unique challenge for administrators to balance healthcare resources between the COVID-19 surge and regular patient admissions. Methods: An enhanced ACS (eACS) model of care is described with the aim of limiting COVID-19 healthcare worker and patient cross-infection as well as providing 24/7 management of emergency general surgical (GS) and trauma patients. The eACS service comprised 5 independent teams covering a rolling 1:5 24-hr call. Attempts to completely separate eACS teams and patients from the elective side were made. The service was compared to the existing ACS service in terms of clinical and efficiency outcomes. Finally, a survey of staff attitudes towards these changes, concerns regarding COVID-19 and psychological well-being was assessed. Results: There were no staff/patient COVID-19 cross-infections. Compared to the ACS service, eACS patients had reduced overall length of stay (2-days), time spent in the Emergency Room (46 min) and time from surgery to discharge (2.4-hours). The eACS model of care saved financial resources and bed-days for the organisation. The changes were well received by team-members who also felt that their safety was prioritised. Conclusion: In healthcare systems not overwhelmed by COVID-19, an eACS model may assist in preserving psychological well-being for healthcare staff whilst providing 24/7 care for emergency GS and trauma patients. © 2020","Acute care surgery; COVID-19; Trauma",,,"Injury",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087029233

In late 2019 a new member of this family belonging to the Betacoronavirus genera (referred to as COVID-19) originated and spread quickly across the world calling for strict containment plans and policies. In most countries in the world, the outbreak of the disease has been serious and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased daily, while, fortunately the recovered COVID-19 cases have also increased. Clearly, forecasting the “confirmed” and “recovered” COVID-19 cases helps planning to control the disease and plan for utilization of health care resources. Time series models based on statistical methodology are useful to model time-indexed data and for forecasting. Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP–SMN–AR models, is a flexible family of models involving many classical symmetric/asymmetric and light/heavy tailed autoregressive models.

Appropriate age-adjusted D-dimer testing improves D-dimer specificity, could decrease inappropriate CT pulmonary angiograms in the older person, and prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. A “COVID-19 blood battery”, designed to increase the efficiency of evaluation of COVID-19 suspected patients is used in our institution. It includes D-dimers which are elevated in COVID-19 infections and potentially an index of severe infection. These 3 very frail patients presented late to the emergency department, all acutely and non-specifically unwell, with high prevalence of comorbidities and were transferred in by ambulance. They were triaged to the COVID-19 pathway of our hospital, and subsequently had negative COVID-19 swabs. All had an incidental finding of markedly elevated D-dimers, with potential causes of their symptoms other than pulmonary embolus. They were transferred to an acute geriatric ward specifically designated to manage older patients (>75years) who had negative nasopharyngeal swab results. They were all ultimately diagnosed with extensive pulmonary emboli with evidence of raised pulmonary pressures on CTPA and/or echocardiogram. It is possible that these patients had false negative COVID-19 swabs. Allowing for the novel nature of COVID-19, prospective evaluation for new symptoms and complications such as thromboembolic disease in those affected by milder symptoms should be considered. In the absence of clinical improvement following treatment of other conditions in frail older patients, D-dimer testing could be indicated with pursuit of specific diagnostic evaluation for venous thromboembolism when significantly elevated. © 2020, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; D-dimer; older patient; Pulmonary embolus",,,"J.

Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, of which a large subset of patients features neurological symptoms, commonly headache. The virus is highly contagious and is, therefore, changing clinical practice by forcing limitations on in-person visits and procedural treatments, more quickly shifting toward the widespread adaptation of telemedicine services. Design/Results: We review what is currently known about the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and how it relates to possible mechanisms of headache, including indirect, potential direct, and secondary causes. Alternative options for the treatment of patients with headache disorders and the use of telemedicine are also explored. Conclusions: Limited information exists regarding the mechanisms and timing of headache in patients with COVID-19, though causes relate to plausible direct viral invasion of the nervous system as well as the cytokine release syndrome. Though headache care in the COVID-19 era requires alterations, the improved preventive treatment options now available and evidence for feasibility and safety of telemedicine well positions clinicians to take care of such patients, especially in the COVID-19 epicenter of New York City. © 2020 American Headache Society","COVID-19; headache; telemedicine; trainees",,"32521039","Headache",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087319343

Methods: A retrospective review of the first adult elective cases performed between May 18, 2020 and June 14, 2020, after the end of lockdown was analysed in Belgium to answer the following questions: (1) for the 236 cancelled patients during the outbreak, how easy was rescheduling? (2) How useful was universal RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan for the 211 orthopaedic and trauma admissions? (3) How were surgical difficulty category, number of operations and complications different when compared to the pre-COVID period? (4) How would patients balance the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19? Results: Before surgery, blood tests for anaesthesiology and imaging related to the surgical procedure were scheduled prior to universal testing (COVID-19 PCR and chest CT) performed 72–120 hours before surgery. Among the 211 asymptomatic patients who were tested before surgery, six had positive PCR, while no abnormality was found on the chest CT scan of all the patients. With this timing for tests, the 104 patients included in the current study for elective surgery were free of disease before undergoing surgery and remained without COVID-19 after surgery. Among the 366 cancelled patients during the outbreak, only 12% of the patients accepted to proceed with rescheduling immediately. Therefore, this resulted in a 70% reduction for elective surgery and in a 50% reduction for arthroplasties as compared to pre-COVID period. The rate of complications was not increased during the post-COVID period. A portion of patients have confused idea of screening and have difficulty to perceive the new rules of health organization. Conclusions: Resumption of elective surgical procedures appears more difficult for patients than for surgeons with a low percentage of cancelled patients accepting to reschedule surgery. Universal testing allowed securing patients; however, surgeons must explore better patient perceptions regarding COVID-19 to facilitate a fully informed decision in the current period. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.","Chest CT scan; Elective surgery; Ethics; Fracture; Hip arthroplasty; Post-COVID-19; Psychological burden; Surgery cancellation",,,"Int.

A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach α value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (r = 0.481, p < 0.001) and stress (r = 0.389, p < 0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-M’s properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods.

Developing effective control measures for COVID-19, especially measures that can halt the worsening of severe cases to a critical status is of urgent importance. CASE SUMMARY A 52-year-old woman presented with a high fever (38.8 °C), chills, dizziness, and weakness. Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster. A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 x 109/L (60.6 ± 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 ± 1.34% lymphocytes). Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes. Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Following treatment with early non-invasive ventilation and a bundle pharmacotherapy, she recovered with a good outcome. CONCLUSION Early non-invasive ventilation with a bundle pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment regimen for the broader population of patients with COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2020.","Bundle pharmacotherapy; Case report; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Non-invasive ventilation; Pneumonia","alpha interferon; herbaceous agent; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; methylprednisolone; thymosin; unclassified drug; xuebijing; adult; Article; blood oxygen tension; breathing rate; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; female; fever; fractional inspired oxygen; heart rate; human; intensive care unit; lymphocyte count; middle aged; myalgia; neutrophil count; noninvasive ventilation; positive end expiratory pressure; respiratory failure; respiratory tract parameters; sputum analysis",,"World J.

Among these, 67 (51.5%) had a relative with COVID-19 while 34 (26.2%) had comorbidities, with the most frequent being respiratory, cardiac, or neuromuscular chronic diseases. Overall, 98 (75.4%) had an asymptomatic or mild disease, 11 (8.5%) had moderate disease, 11 (8.5%) had a severe disease, and 9 (6.9%) had a critical presentation with infants below 6 months having significantly increased risk of critical disease severity (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 29.1). Seventy-five (57.7%) children were hospitalized, 15 (11.5%) needed some respiratory support, and nine (6.9%) were treated in an intensive care unit. All recovered. Conclusion:This descriptive case series of children with COVID-19, mostly encompassing of cases enrolled at hospital level, suggest that COVID-19 may have a non-negligible rate of severe presentations in selected pediatric populations with a relatively high rates of comorbidities.

Seventy-five patients with COVID-19 were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and they were classified into moderate, severe and critically severe types according to the disease severity. The basic information, blood routine, pneumonia-related blood indexes, immune-related indexes along with liver, kidney and myocardial indexes in patients with different types were analyzed. The analysis of immune-related indexes showed that the proportions of critically severe patients with abnormal interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 were higher than those of severe and moderate patients. In addition, the proportion of patients with abnormal total cholesterol increased as the severity of disease increased, and the proportion in critically severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients. The patients with a more severe COVID-19 are older and more likely to have a history of hypertension. With the progression of COVID-19, the abnormal proportion of total white blood cell, neutrophils, lymphocytes, IL-2, IL-4, and total cholesterol increased. The change of these indexes in patients with different COVID-19 types could provide reference for the disease severity identification and diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, the change in the total cholesterol level suggested that COVID-19 would induce some liver function damage in patients. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","clinical features; coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); laboratory index; symptoms",,"32589755","J.

Containment measures were approved soon thereafter. The present study aims at providing a first look at the impact of the containment measures on the outbreak progression in the Veneto region, Italy. Methods: A Bayesian changepoint analysis was used to identify the changing speed of the epidemic curve. Then, a piecewise polynomial model was considered to fit the data in the first period before the detected changepoint. In this time interval, that is, the weeks from 27 February to 12 March, a quadratic growth was identified by a generalised additive model (GAM). Finally, the model was used to generate the projection of the expected number of hospitalisations at 2 weeks based on the epidemic speed before the changepoint. Such estimates were then compared with the actual outbreak behaviour. Results: The comparison between the observed and predicted hospitalisation curves highlights a slowdown on the total COVID-19 hospitalisations after the onset of containment measures. The estimated daily slowdown effect of the epidemic growth is estimated as 78 hospitalisations per day as of 27 March (95% CI 75 to 81).

This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol.

Our aim was to determine the value of incorporating a chest computed tomography (CT) scan during acute stroke imaging, and the factors that influence this decision. METHODS: We constructed a probabilistic decision tree of the value of acquiring a chest CT scan or not, expressed in quality-adjusted life months (QALM) of patients and medical professionals. The model was based on the chance of detecting infection by chest CT scan, the case fatality rates of COVID-19 infection, the risk of COVID-19 infection after exposure, the expected proportion of medical professionals exposed, and the exposure reduction derived from early disease detection. RESULTS: The decision to incorporate the chest CT scan was superior to not doing so (12.00 QALM vs 11.99 QALM, respectively), when the probability of patients having undetected COVID-19 infection is 3.5%, potentially exposing 100% of medical professionals, and if early detection reduces exposure by 50%. The risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection following exposure casts uncertainty on the results, but this is offset by the potential for reducing exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a measurable benefit of incorporating a chest CT into the urgent imaging protocol of acute stroke patients in reducing exposure of medical professionals without appropriate precautions. The clinical impact of this benefit, however, may not be materially significant. © 2020 American Society of Neuroimaging","Computed tomography; COVID-19; stroke",,"32589348","J.

Methods: From March 14 to April 6, 2020, 72 non-hospitalized patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA for COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively identified. Relevant clinical and laboratory data and CT scan findings were collected for each patient. CTPA scans were reviewed by two radiologists to determinate the presence or absence of APE. Clinical classification, lung involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia, and CT total severity score were compared between APE group and non-APE group. Results: APE was identified in 13 (18%) CTPA scans. The mean age and D-dimer of patients from the APE group were higher in comparison with those from the non-APE group (74.4 vs. 59.6 years, p = 0.008, and 7.29 vs. 3.29 μg/ml, p = 0.011). There was no significant difference between APE and non-APE groups concerning clinical type, COVID-19 pneumonia lung lesions (ground-glass opacity: 85% vs. 97%; consolidation: 69% vs. 68%; crazy paving: 38% vs. 37%; linear reticulation: 69% vs. 78%), CT severity score (6.3 vs. 7.1, p = 0.365), quality of CTPA (1.8 vs. 2.0, p = 0.518), and pleural effusion (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.146). Conclusions: Non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia referred to CT scan by the emergency departments are at risk of APE. The presence of APE was not limited to severe or critical clinical type of COVID-19 pneumonia. Key Points: • Acute pulmonary embolism was found in 18% of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients referred by the emergency department to CTPA. Two (15%) patients had main, four (30%) lobar, and seven (55%) segmental acute pulmonary embolism. • Five of 13 (38%) patients with acute pulmonary embolism had a moderate clinical type. • Severity and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia showed no significant difference between patients with or without acute pulmonary embolism. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronavirus; CT angiography; Pneumonia; Pulmonary embolism",,,"Eur.

Case reports of hospitalized patients suggest that COVID-19 prominently affects the cardiovascular system, but the overall impact remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the presence of myocardial injury in unselected patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective observational cohort study, 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness were identified from the University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry between April and June 2020. Exposure: Recent recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on swab test of the upper respiratory tract. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were obtained. Comparisons were made with age-matched and sex-matched control groups of healthy volunteers (n = 50) and risk factor-matched patients (n = 57). Results: Of the 100 included patients, 53 (53%) were male, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 49 (45-53) years. The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR was 71 (64-92) days. Of the 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered at home, while 33 (33%) required hospitalization. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) was detectable (3 pg/mL or greater) in 71 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (71%) and significantly elevated (13.9 pg/mL or greater) in 5 patients (5%). Compared with healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls, patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volumes, higher left ventricle mass, and raised native T1 and T2. A total of 78 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (78%) had abnormal CMR findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), and pericardial enhancement (n = 22). There was a small but significant difference between patients who recovered at home vs in the hospital for native T1 mapping (median [IQR], 1122 [1113-1132] ms vs 1143 [1131-1156] ms; P =.02) but not for native T2 mapping or hsTnT levels. None of these measures were correlated with time from COVID-19 diagnosis (native T1: r = 0.07; P =.47; native T2: r = 0.14; P =.15; hsTnT: r = -0.07; P =.50). High-sensitivity troponin T was significantly correlated with native T1 mapping (r = 0.35; P <.001) and native T2 mapping (r = 0.22; P =.03). Endomyocardial biopsy in patients with severe findings revealed active lymphocytic inflammation. Native T1 and T2 were the measures with the best discriminatory ability to detect COVID-19-related myocardial pathology. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.

We aim to identify the prevalence and prognostic significance of delirium as the sole onset manifestation of COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective single-centre study based on review of medical charts, conducted during the outbreak peak (March 27-April 18, 2020) in a Lombard dementia facility, including 59 elderly subjects with dementia and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Findings: Of the 59 residents, 57 (96⋅6%) tested positive (mean age: 82⋅8; women: 66⋅7%). Comorbidities were present in all participants, with 18/57 (31⋅6%) having three or more concomitant diseases. Delirium-Onset COVID-19 (DOC) was observed in 21/57 (36⋅8%) subjects who were chiefly older (mean age: 85⋅4 y/o) and with multiple comorbidities. Eleven/21 DOC patients (52⋅4%) had hypoactive delirium, while hyperactive delirium occurred in ten/21 (47⋅6%). Lymphopenia was present in almost all subjects (median: 1⋅3 × 109/L). Overall mortality rate was 24⋅6% (14/57) and dementia severity per se had no impact on short-term mortality due to COVID-19. DOC was strongly associated with higher mortality (p&lt;0⋅001). Also, DOC and male gender were independently associated with increased risk of mortality (OR: 17⋅0, 95% CI: 2⋅8–102⋅7, p = 0⋅002 and 13⋅6, 95% CI: 2⋅3–79⋅2, p = 0⋅001 respectively). Interpretation: Delirium occurrence in the elderly with dementia may represent a prodromal phase of COVID-19, and thus deserves special attention, especially in the presence of lymphopenia. Hypoxia and a severe inflammatory state may develop subsequently. DOC cases have higher short-term mortality rate.

COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease, primarily affecting the respiratory system. Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on respiratory specimens is considered the reference by which to diagnose COVID-19. However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain. As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered. Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with health services utilization among breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of perceived health status, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, anxiety, coping resources, health services utilization (contact with healthcare professionals, cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic), and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated; contact with healthcare professionals was the dependent variable. In addition, a logistic regression was calculated; cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic because of the COVID-19 was the dependent variable. Results: Breast cancer patients' contact with healthcare professionals was lower than their contact prior to the pandemic. A higher extent of contact with healthcare professionals was related to patients' perception of health as bad/reasonable, lower perceived susceptibility, a lower sense of mastery, and higher social support. In addition, the odds of cancelling an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic were higher in the presence of additional chronic illnesses, and a higher sense of mastery. Significance of results: The results could provide public health agencies with a more complete picture of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among breast cancer patients. This is significant because, in the event that COVID-19 re-emerges, the findings of the current study could help guide public health officials and possibly prevent the future avoidance of health services' use among this high-risk population. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at highest risk. There are not many studies reporting its incidence in non-ICU patients. A large number of COVID-19 patients in Singapore, with symptoms ranging from mild to moderate, have been admitted to either Community Care Facilities (CCF) or in general wards of Public Healthcare Institutions (PHI). In case there is a surge of COVID-19 patients, there is a possibility that general wards in PHIs may need to admit an increasing numbers of acutely ill patients, with only the critical ones being admitted to ICU. The incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients is not exactly known and its detection in these patients is challenging. Thus, the healthcare staff managing these patients at the CCFs and general wards at the PHIs should be vigilant and monitor these patients for development of signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, as well as trend D-dimer level. An algorithm for a potential approach to manage VTE in non-ICU COVID-19 patients is described. A prospective study is needed to establish the incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients in Singapore and the predictive value of D-dimer levels to detect this risk, as well as a therapeutic protocol to initiate appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in these patients. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; deep vein thrombosis; non-ICU",,,"Proc.

Patients with diabetes and uncontrolled blood glucose levels are at increased risk for poor clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19. Therefore, achieving good glycaemic control is of paramount importance among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is a safe and effective intervention for the management of hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients. The aim of this article is to provide a practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. Methods: This guidance document was formulated based on the review of available literature and the combined personal experiences of the authors. We provide a comprehensive review on the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen, including its principles, rationale, indications, prerequisites, initiation, and dose titration, and also suggest targets for blood glucose control and different levels of capillary blood glucose monitoring. Various case scenarios are used to illustrate how optimal glucose control can be achieved, such as through adjustments in doses of prandial and basal insulin, the use of correctional insulin dosing and changes in the timing and content of major and minor meals. Conclusion: The practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus presented here can be used for patients admitted to hospital for indications other than COVID-19 and for those in ambulatory care. © 2020, The Author(s).","Basal insulin; Basal-bolus insulin; Continuous glucose monitoring system; Correctional insulin; COVID-19; Diabetes; Hyperglycaemia; In-hospital hyperglycaemia; Prandial insulin",,,"Diabetes Ther.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088108187

We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected. Conclusions: PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in the United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases. © 2020 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy",,,,"Gastrointest.

Sixty-two COVID-19 patients in the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine and Loudi Center for Diseases Prevention and Control, from January to March 2020, were sampled as the novel coronavirus pneumonia infected group. One hundred and thirty-one cases from the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, including 67 healthy individuals and 64 non-COVID-19 inpatients, served as the noninfected group. Approximately every 5 days, sera from 20 cases were collected and analyzed three times, using an automatic biochemical analyzer, to detect serum MMP3 concentrations. Correlation was analyzed between MMP3 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Following normality tests, differences in serum MMP3 levels between the infected and noninfected group were analyzed via SPSS (version 25.0) software, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The MMP3 concentration was 44.44 (23.46 ~ 72.12) ng/mL in the infected group and 32.42 (28.16 ~ 41.21) ng/mL in the noninfected group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Z = −2.799, P =.005 <.05). A positive correlation was found between MMP3 and interleukin 1β (IL-1β; r =.681, P =.000 <.05), and IL-6 (r =.529, P =.002 <.05). Serum MMP3 concentration, measured over three separate time points, were 55.98 (30.80 ~ 75.97) ng/mL, 34.84 (0.00 ~ 51.84) ng/mL, and 5.71 (0.00 ~ 40.46) ng/mL, respectively.

Objective: To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric asthma services and on disease burden in their patients. Methods: An online survey was sent to members of the Pediatric Asthma in Real Life think tank and the World Allergy Organization Pediatric Asthma Committee. It included questions on service provision, disease burden, and the clinical course of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection among children with asthma. Results: Ninety-one respondents, caring for an estimated population of more than 133,000 children with asthma, completed the survey. COVID-19 significantly impacted pediatric asthma services: 39% ceased physical appointments, 47% stopped accepting new patients, and 75% limited patients' visits. Consultations were almost halved to a median of 20 (interquartile range, 10-25) patients per week. Virtual clinics and helplines were launched in most centers. Better than expected disease control was reported in 20% (10%-40%) of patients, whereas control was negatively affected in only 10% (7.5%-12.5%). Adherence also appeared to increase. Only 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported among the population; the estimated incidence is not apparently different from the reports of general pediatric cohorts. Conclusions: Children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Outcomes may even have improved, possibly through increased adherence and/or reduced exposures.

We conducted a nation-wide survey of all heart transplant centers in Germany presenting the clinical characteristics of heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 during the first months of the pandemic in Germany. Methods and results: A multicenter survey of all heart transplant centers in Germany evaluating the current status of COVID-19 among adult heart transplant recipients was performed. A total of 21 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 was reported to the transplant centers during the first months of the pandemic in Germany. Mean patient age was 58.6 ± 12.3 years and 81.0% were male. Comorbidities included arterial hypertension (71.4%), dyslipidemia (71.4%), diabetes mellitus (33.3%), chronic kidney failure requiring dialysis (28.6%) and chronic-obstructive lung disease/asthma (19.0%). Most patients received an immunosuppressive drug regimen consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (71.4%), mycophenolate mofetil (85.7%) and steroids (71.4%). Eight of 21 patients (38.1%) displayed a severe course needing invasive mechanical ventilation. Those patients showed a high mortality (87.5%) which was associated with right ventricular dysfunction (62.5% vs. 7.7%; p = 0.014), arrhythmias (50.0% vs. none; p = 0.012), and thromboembolic events (50.0% vs. none; p = 0.012). Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T- and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were significantly associated with the severe form of COVID-19 (p = 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Severe course of COVID-19 was frequent in heart transplanted patients. High mortality was associated with right ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Heart transplantation; Immunosuppression; Mortality",,,"Clin.

In screening mammography, clinical audits are used to assess radiologists’ performance annually, however, the nature of these audits prevent robust data analysis due to the low prevalence of breast cancer and the long waiting periods for the audit results. Research-based evidence revealed a need for changes in the methods utilised to optimise the assessment of the efficacy of radiologists’ interpretations. Methods: A cloud-based platform was developed to assess and enhance radiologists’ performance help reduce variability in medical image interpretations in a research environment; however, to address a number of limitations, the platform was commercialised to make it available worldwide. Results: DetectED-X's team have been able to make their cloud-based platform available worldwide, tailored to the needs of radiologists and accredited for continuing medical/professional education; thus, changing the continuous professional development practice globally. Conclusion: DetectED-X's Rivelato, was developed to address a need for effective, available and affordable educational solutions for clinicians and health care workers wherever they are located. A true fusion of industry, academia, clinics and consumer to adapt to the growing needs of clinicians’ around the world, the latest being COVID-19 global pandemic. DetectED-X repurposed its platform to educate physicians around the world on the appearances of COVID-19 on Lung Computed Tomography scans, introducing CovED to clinicians worldwide free of charge as a multi-national consortium of collaboration to help fight COVID-19, showing how research-based evidence can create effective and scalable change globally. © 2020 The College of Radiographers","Continuous medical education; Continuous professional development; COVID-19; Mammography; Mammography training",,,"Radiography",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087949873

The association with hepatic steatosis, however, a condition closely related to obesity within the spectrum of systemic metabolic dysfunctions, remains to be elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of hepatic steatosis as incidentally detected in chest CT examinations of COVID-19 positive patients in comparison to non-infected controls. Methods: A retrospective study was performed with 316 patients (204 RT-PCR positive; 112 RT-PCR negative and chest CT negative). Steatosis was measured with placement of a single ROI in the right lobe of the liver (segments VI-VII) and defined as a liver attenuation value ≤ 40 HU. Results: The frequency of hepatic steatosis was higher in the RT-PCR positive group in comparison to controls (31.9% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Logistic linear regression analysis showed a 4.7 times odds of steatosis in the COVID-19 positive group as compared to controls after adjusting for age and sex (OR 4.698; 95% IC 2.12–10.41, p < 0.001). Conclusion: A significantly higher prevalence of steatosis was found among COVID-19 positive individuals. These findings are in accordance with other recent studies linking obesity and COVID-19 infection, as there is an intricate relationship between liver steatosis, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Further studies are required to confirm if such association remains after accounting for multiple variables, as well as possible relationships with disease severity and worst clinical outcomes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; CT; Hepatic steatosis; Liver",,"32683613","Abdom.

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional prospective CT scan survey was conducted between March 16 and April 12, 2020, in accordance with the local IRB. Seven hundred nine radiology centers were invited to participate in a weekly online survey. Numbers of CT examinations related to COVID-19 including at least chest (CTcovid) and whole chest CT scan activities (CTchest) were recorded each week. A sub-analysis on French departments was performed during the 4 weeks of the study. The impact of the number of RT-PCRs (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions) on the CT workflow was tested using two-sample t test and Pearson’s test. Results: Five hundred seventy-seven structures finally registered (78%) with mean response numbers of 336 ± 18.9 (323; 351). Mean CTchest activity per radiologic structure ranged from 75.8 ± 133 (0–1444) on week 12 to 99.3 ± 138.6 (0–1147) on week 13. Mean ratio of CTcovid on CTchest varied from 0.36 to 0.59 on week 12 and week 14 respectively. There was a significant relationship between the number of RT-PCR performed and the number of CTcovid (r = 0.73, p = 3.10−16) but no link with the number of positive RT-PCR results. Conclusion: In case of local high density COVID-19, CT workflow is strongly modified and redirected to the management of these specific patients. Key Points: • Over the 4-week survey period, 117,686 chest CT (CTtotal) were performed among the responding centers, including 61,784 (52%) CT performed for COVID-19 (CTcovid). • Across the country, the ratio CTcovid/CTtotalvaried from 0.36 to 0.59 and depended significantly on the local epidemic density (p = 0.003). • In clinical practice, in a context of growing epidemic, in France, chest CT was used as a surrogate to RT-PCR for patient triage. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","COVID-19; Prospective; Radiology; Surveys and questionnaires; Tomography; X-Ray computed",,"32621241","Eur.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Kunming Third People’s Hospital in China from January 20 to February 28, 2020. Medical records and laboratory data were extracted and combined for COVID-19 and other pulmonary infection patients on admission. A partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was constructed and calibrated to discriminate COVID-19 from other pulmonary infection patients. Results: COVID-19 patients diagnosed and treated in Kunming were balanced in terms of sex and covered all age groups. Most of them were mild cases; only five were severe cases. The first two dimensions of the PLS-DA model could classify COVID-19 and other pulmonary infection patients with an accuracy of 96.6% (95.1% in the cross-validation model). Basophil count, the proportion of basophils, prothrombin time, prothrombin time activity, and international normalized ratio were the five most discriminant biomarkers.

Methods: The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's daily briefings were thoroughly reviewed. Information about hospital countermeasures and government coordination was collected via telephone interviews with 4 infection control team leaders, 1 emergency department nurse, and 1 infectious disease physician in Korea. Results: After the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the government and hospitals prepared for the inevitable outbreak of emerging infectious diseases by reforming the epidemic preparedness system. As a result, COVID-19 diagnostic test kits were quickly developed, enabling extensive early detection of potential cases. Other key steps were tracking cases, finding exposed individuals, coordinating case assignments with health care facilities, and selective clinic screenings for visitors’ entering hospitals with mandatory mask wearing. Consequently, after overcoming the initial peak of the outbreak, which was related to a religious group, Korea has been able to maintain daily new cases at around 100 and to less than 50 daily cases in the second week of April.

However, the association between stress and seizures has not been thoroughly investigated. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing tremendous collateral stress. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on seizures in PWE in the most severely affected area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities. Methods: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, PWE were surveyed via online questionnaires between February 23 and March 5, 2020. Collected data included demographic information, epilepsy-related characteristics (seizure type, frequency, antiepileptic drugs [AEDs], and medication management), direct and perceived threat of COVID-19, and changes in seizures during the outbreak. Psychological comorbidities were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire–9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 items, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify precipitants for seizure exacerbation. Results: We received 362 completed questionnaires after excluding 12 duplicates (response rate = 63.51%). A total of 31 (8.56%) patients had increased seizures during the outbreak. Exposure history to COVID-19 (P =.001), uncontrolled seizure after AED therapy (P =.020), seizure frequency of two or more times per month before the outbreak (P =.005), change of AED regimen during the outbreak (AED reduction, withdrawal, replacement, skipping altogether; P =.002), and worry about the adverse effect of the outbreak on overall seizure-related issues (severity = moderate to critical; P =.038) were risk factors for increased seizures. Significance: A minority of PWE experienced seizure exacerbation during the outbreak of COVID-19. Stress, uncontrolled seizures, and inappropriate change in AED regimen were associated with increased seizures. Based on these findings, stress might be an independent precipitant for triggering seizures in some PWE. © 2020 International League Against Epilepsy","COVID-19; epilepsy; precipitant; seizure exacerbation; stress",,,"Epilepsia",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089099400

We compared the diurnal patient number and the cumulative regional distribution map of registrations in CT-surveillance to those of the PCR-positive patient surveillance (PCR-surveillance). Results: A total of 637 patients was registered from January 1 to April 17, 2020 for CT-surveillance. Their PCR test results were positive (n = 62.5–398%), negative (n = 8.9–57%), unknown (n = 26.2–167%), and other disease (n = 2.4–15%). An age peak at 60–69 years and male dominance were observed in CT-surveillance. The most common CT finding was bilaterally distributed ground-glass opacities. The diurnal number and the cumulative regional distribution map by CT-surveillance showed tendencies that were similar to those revealed by PCR-surveillance. Conclusion: Using clinical CT data, CT-surveillance program delineated the epidemiologic features of COVID-19 infection. © 2020, Japan Radiological Society.","COVID-19; Pneumonia; Public health practice; Surveys and questionnaires; Tomography; Viral; X-ray computed",,,"Jpn.

However, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive by nucleic acid detection. Sixty-four cases were coinfected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Among the 64 coinfected patients, 54 (84.4%) were coinfected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P <.001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazards ratio of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P =.020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval: 1.103-3.196). Among influenza coinfected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within 2 weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%; P =.001). There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; influenza; lopinavir/ritonavir; pneumonia",,"32621621","J.

We describe the clinical progress and lung ultrasound findings of a Singaporean COVID-19 intensive care unit patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Methods: The clinical course of one COVID-19 patient managed in the intensive care unit was traced. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 virus infection and intubated after developing respiratory failure. Serial point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound was performed by the managing intensivist daily, and correlated with the clinical progress and chest X-ray imaging done for the patient. Results: The patient exhibited lung ultrasound findings consistent with that described for viral pneumonias. This included numerous B-lines and subpleural consolidations with disrupted pleural lines distributed symmetrically, predominantly in bilateral upper BLUE points, and lower BLUE points bilaterally. Coalescing B-lines leading on to the development of bilateral “white lung” were associated with worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome. An increased density or reduction of the B-lines was associated with clinical improvement or deterioration, respectively. Conclusions: Trained clinicians, who are familiar with point-of-care lung ultrasonography, may consider point-of-care bedside ultrasound as an important adjunct to history and physical examination for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 when advanced imaging is not available because of logistical reasons or infectious control. This applies in particular to cases where resources are limited, and patient transfers to facilities offering such services may prove hazardous. © Polish Ultrasound Society.","ARDS; COVID-19; Pneumonia; Point-of-care lung ultrasound; Respiratory failure","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; barotrauma; case report; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; echography; female; human; intensive care unit; lung echography; morbidity; mortality; pleura effusion; point of care testing; positive end expiratory pressure; respiratory failure; respiratory syncytial virus infection; Singapore; tachypnea; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia",,"J.

A cross-sectional online survey of 2005 gamblers, including a sub-sample of 1081 online gamblers (age 18 years and older), was administered to assess risky gambling behaviours and motivations, financial impacts from COVID-19, the influence of COVID-19 on online gambling, mental health concerns and substance use. A series of odds ratio comparisons and measures of association were carried out. Results show significant likelihood of online gambling among those classified as high-risk gamblers (according to the Problem Gambling Severity Index) and those with past experience of online gambling, though migration from land-based gambling was apparent. Among high-risk online gamblers, the most predictive risk factors included moderate and severe anxiety and depression, reduced work hours, being influenced to gamble due to COVID-19, gambling under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and risky gambling motives tied to mental health concerns, including gambling because it helps with nervousness and depression, chasing gambling losses and seeking to earn income. This study has confirmed many of the risk associations presented in emerging COVID-19-related studies and past research on global economic crisis relating to gambling risk, mental health concerns and substance use. However, unlike many past studies, the present paper takes note of all of these elements holistically and provides incremental clarity on online gambling risk factors during the pandemic, specifically. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Financial stress; Gambling motives; Mental health; Online gambling; Substance use",,,"Int.

At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 11,301,850 confirmed cases while more than 531,806 have died due to it, with these figures rising daily across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is, therefore, crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is a compelling paradigm that allows for the utilization of case-specific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study, therefore, aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in the classification of suspected cases of COVID-19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and the semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved from 71 (67 adults and 4 pediatrics) cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories with an accuracy of 94.54%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 based on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory tests. As a result, there will be a global minimization of contagion rate occasioned by slow testing and in addition, reduced false-positive rates of diagnosed cases as observed in some parts of the globe. © 2020 The Authors","Case-based reasoning; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Natural language processing; Ontology",,,"Inform.

The number of kidney transplants has declined during the pandemic. We describe our deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT) experience during the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the safety of DDKT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple preventive measures were implemented. Adult patients that underwent DDKT from 3/1/20 to 4/30/20 were included. COVID-19 clinical manifestations from donors and recipients, and post-transplant outcomes (COVID-19 infections, readmissions, allograft rejection, and mortality) were obtained. The kidney transplant (KT) recipients were followed until 5/31/20. Results: Seventy-six patients received kidneys from 57 donors. Fever, dyspnea, and cough were reported in 1, 2, and 1 donor, respectively. Thirty-eight (66.6%) donors were tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) prior to donation (mainly by nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and 36 (47.3%) KT recipients were tested at the time of DDKT by nasopharyngeal PCR; all of these were negative. Our recipients were followed for a median of 63 (range: 33-91) days. A total of 42 (55.3%) recipients were tested post-transplant for SARS-CoV2 by nasopharyngeal PCR including 12 patients that became symptomatic; all tests were negative except for one that was inconclusive, but it was repeated and came back negative. Forty (52.6%) KT recipients were readmitted, and 7 (9.2%) had biopsy-proven rejection during the follow-up. None of the KT recipients transplanted during this period died.

A genome sequence is the core of this virus which interferes with the normal activities of its counterparts within humans. Analysis of its genome may provide clues toward the proper treatment of patients and the design of new drugs and vaccines. Microsatellites are composed of short genome subsequences which are successively repeated many times in the same direction. They are highly variable in terms of their building blocks, number of repeats, and their locations in the genome sequences. This mutability property has been the source of many diseases. Usually the host genome is analyzed to diagnose possible diseases in the victim. In this research, the focus is concentrated on the attacker's genome for discovery of its malicious properties. Results: The focus of this research is the microsatellites of both SARS and Covid-19. An accurate and highly efficient computer method for identifying all microsatellites in the genome sequences is discovered and implemented, and it is used to find all microsatellites in the Coronavirus-Covid-19 and SARS2003. The Microsatellite discovery is based on an efficient indexing technique called K-Mer Hash Indexing. The method is called Fast Microsatellite Discovery (FMSD) and it is used for both SARS and Covid-19. A table composed of all microsatellites is reported. There are many differences between SARS and Covid-19, but there is an outstanding difference which requires further investigation.

We report the preliminary results of a targeted program of COVID-19 infection testing in the ED in the first 10 days of its initiation at our institution. Methods: We conducted a review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs during the initial 10 days of testing (March 10-19, 2020). During this initial period with limited resources, testing was targeted toward high-risk patients per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Data collected from patients who were tested included demographics, clinical characteristics, and test qualifying criteria. We present the data overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. Results: During the 10-day study period, the combined census of the study EDs was 2157 patient encounters. A total of 283 tests were ordered in the ED. The majority of patients were 18-64 years of age, male, non-Hispanic white, had an Emergency Severity Index score of three, did not have a fever, and were discharged from the ED. A total of 29 (10.2%) tested positive. Symptoms-based criteria most associated with COVID-19 were the most common criteria identified for testing (90.6%). All other criteria were reported in 5.51-43.0% of persons being tested. Having contact with a person under investigation was significantly more common in those who tested positive compared to those who tested negative (63% vs 24.5%, respectively). The majority of patients in both results groups had at least two qualifying criteria for testing (75.2%). Conclusion: In this review of prospectively collected data on all ED patients who had targeted testing for acute COVID-19 infection at two EDs in the first 10 days of testing, we found that 10.2% of those tested were identified as positive. The continued monitoring of testing and results will help providers understand how COVID-19 is progressing in the community. Copyright: © 2020 Tolia et al.

A negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on access to care for children with cancer is likely but has not been evaluated. METHODS: A 34-item survey focusing on barriers to pediatric oncology management during the COVID-19 pandemic was distributed to heads of pediatric oncology units within the Pediatric Oncology East and Mediterranean (POEM) collaborative group, from the Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia. Responses were collected on April 11 through 22, 2020. Corresponding rates of proven COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the World Health Organization database. Results: In total, 34 centers from 19 countries participated. Almost all centers applied guidelines to optimize resource utilization and safety, including delaying off-treatment visits, rotating and reducing staff, and implementing social distancing, hand hygiene measures, and personal protective equipment use. Essential treatments, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, were delayed in 29% to 44% of centers, and 24% of centers restricted acceptance of new patients. Clinical care delivery was reported as negatively affected in 28% of centers. Greater than 70% of centers reported shortages in blood products, and 47% to 62% reported interruptions in surgery and radiation as well as medication shortages. However, bed availability was affected in <30% of centers, reflecting the low rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the corresponding countries at the time of the survey. Conclusions: Mechanisms to approach childhood cancer treatment delivery during crises need to be re-evaluated, because treatment interruptions and delays are expected to affect patient outcomes in this otherwise largely curable disease. © 2020 American Cancer Society","care delivery; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); middle-income countries; pandemic; pediatric oncology",,,"Cancer",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087697770

Methods: A total of 78 ISOA patients were recruited from April 6, 2020, to April 10, 2020, through a public call of University of Mons (Mons, Belgium). Patients benefited from nasopharyngeal swabs and fulfilled the patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among them, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using olfactory identification testing. Based on the duration of the ISOA, 2 groups of patients were compared: patients with olfactory dysfunction duration ≤12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). Results: In group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load determined by RT-PCR and 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. The psychophysical olfactory evaluation reported that anosmia and hyposmia occurred in 24 (52%) and 11 (24%) patients, respectively. Eleven patients were normosmic. The viral load was significantly higher in patients of group 1 compared with those of group 2. Conclusions: Coronavirus disease 2019 was detected in a high proportion of ISOA patients, especially over the first 12 days of olfactory dysfunction.

In order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, infected people must be quickly identified and isolated, and contact with the infected must be blocked early. This study attempted to verify the intervention effects on the spread of an infectious disease by using these measures in a mathematical model. Methods: We used the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) model for a virtual population group connected by a special structured network. In the model, the infected state (I) was divided into I in which the infection is undetected and Ix in which the infection is detected. The probability of transitioning from an I state to Ix can be viewed as the rate at which an infected person is found. We assumed that only those connected to each other in the network can cause infection. In addition, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of isolation by temporarily removing the connection among these people. Results: In Scenario 1, only the infected are isolated; in Scenario 2, those who are connected to an infected person and are also found to be infected are isolated as well. In Scenario 3, everyone connected to an infected person are isolated. In Scenario 3, it was possible to effectively suppress the infectious disease even with a relatively slow rate of diagnosis and relatively high infection rate. Conclusion: During the epidemic, quick identification of the infected is helpful. In addition, it was possible to quantitatively show through a simulation evaluation that the management of infected individuals as well as those who are connected greatly helped to suppress the spread of infectious diseases.","Agent-based model; COVID-19; Isolation; Non-pharmaceutical intervention; Social network","Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; laboratory technique; pandemic; patient isolation; South Korea; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemics; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Republic of Korea","32580532","Epidemiol Health",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089128294

Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4 ± 7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","clinical characteristics; coinfection; COVID-19; influenza virus",,"32196707","J.

Many properties of COVID-19 infection and transmission were still not yet established. Methods: We collated and analysed data on 449 of the earliest COVID-19 cases detected outside Hubei province to make inferences about transmission dynamics and severity of infection. We analysed 64 clusters to make inferences on serial interval and potential role of pre-symptomatic transmission. Results: We estimated an epidemic doubling time of 5.3 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.3, 6.7) and a median incubation period of 4.6 days (95% CI: 4.0, 5.2). We estimated a serial interval distribution with mean 5.7 days (95% CI: 4.7, 6.8) and standard deviation 3.5 days, and effective reproductive number was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.35). We estimated that 32/80 (40%) of transmission events were likely to have occurred prior to symptoms onset in primary cases. Secondary cases in clusters had less severe illness on average than cluster primary cases. Conclusions: The majority of transmissions are occurring around illness onset in an infected person, and pre-symptomatic transmission does play a role. Detection of milder infections among the secondary cases may be more reflective of true disease severity. © 2020 The Authors.

However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women. Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires. Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n = 92, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369 ± 2.003, social isolation: 8.000 ± 2.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565 ± 6.605 and 22.087 ± 8.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease’s psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness’s social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants. Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; pandemic; pregnancy","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; educational status; female; human; major clinical study; pandemic; pregnancy; priority journal; psychology; risk factor; social isolation","32419558","J.

This study aim to describe the epidemiological course of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 and their impact on hospital bed occupancy rates in the first 45 days of the epidemic in the state of Ceará, Northeastern Brazil. Methods: The study used an ecological design with data gathered from multiple government and health care sources. Data were analyzed using Epi Info software. Results: The first cases were confirmed on March 15, 2020. After 45 days, 37,268 cases reported in 85.9% of Ceará’s municipalities, with 1,019 deaths. Laboratory test positivity reached 84.8% at the end of April, a period in which more than 700 daily tests were processed. The average age of cases was 67 (<1-101) years, most occurred in a hospital environment (91.9%), and 58% required hospitalization in an ICU bed. The average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 18 (1-56) days. Patients who died in the hospital had spent an average of six (0-40) days hospitalized. Across Ceará, the bed occupancy rate reached 71.3% in the wards and 80.5% in the ICU. Conclusions: The first 45 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ceará revealed a large number of cases and deaths, spreading initially among the population with a high socioeconomic status. Despite the efforts by the health services and social isolation measures the health system still collapsed. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

Innovative technologies have the potential to address the challenges associated with the manufacture of personalized drug delivery systems, biosensors, and medical devices during a pandemic. 3D-Printing, microfluidics, and Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) can provide an important part on this fight, as are cheap, easy to be operated, capable to provide rapid detection and monitoring of a disease, and deliver medicines. Areas covered: This manuscript answers the question of how these emerging technologies can save lives during a pandemic by avoiding supply chain delays and also by providing rapid diagnostics, disease monitoring, or by offering personalized treatments. The manuscript covers recent approaches in the topic with a focus in manuscripts published in the last year and by emphasising recent regulatory considerations by regulatory agencies in the manufacturing of 3DP systems or other medical devices during COVID. Expert opinion: New manufacturing techniques are emerging with the ability to address the challenges associated with the development of medical devices or diagnostics, during a pandemic. Are many challenges in order to achieve this and especially in short times that are required under a pandemic attack, which will also be covered in this manuscript. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D-printing; COVID-19; diagnostics; disease monitoring; drug delivery; MEMS devices; microfluidics; pandemic; personalized treatment","3D printers; Controlled drug delivery; Disease control; Diseases; Electromechanical devices; MEMS; Supply chains; Targeted drug delivery; Drug delivery system; Emerging technologies; Innovative technology; Manufacturing techniques; Regulatory agencies; Regulatory considerations; Supply chain delays; Worst case scenario; Diagnosis; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; drug delivery system; human; microfluidics; pandemic; three dimensional bioprinting; three dimensional printing","32674622","Expert Rev.

These improved outcomes are a result of reducing delays to treatment and the provision of specialized, holistic interventions. The covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the delivery of these services, such as undetected cases or long delays to treatment. Furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic will likely increase the mental health needs of communities, including the incidence of psychotic disorders. In this perspective piece, we provide suggestions as to how early intervention for psychosis services can adapt within this environment, such as utilizing novel technologies. Finally, we argue that despite the economic consequences of the pandemic, the funding for mental health services, including early intervention services, should be increased in line with the need for these services during and beyond the pandemic. © 2020 College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.",,,"32434611","Ir.

We also constructed a predictive machine learning model based on chest CT and additional data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT. Methods: This study’s cohort consisted of 319 patients who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR testing at the ED. Patient characteristics, demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT results (CO-RADS) were collected. With first RT-PCR as reference standard, the diagnostic performance of chest CT using the CO-RADS score was assessed. Additionally, a predictive machine learning model was constructed using logistic regression. Results: Chest CT, with first RT-PCR as a reference, had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 90.2%, 88.2%, 84.5%, and 92.7%, respectively. The prediction model with CO-RADS, ferritin, leucocyte count, CK, days of complaints, and diarrhea as predictors had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 89.3%, 93.4%, 90.8%, and 92.3%, respectively. Conclusion: Chest CT, using the CO-RADS scoring system, is a sensitive and specific method that can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially if RT-PCR tests are scarce during an outbreak. Combining a predictive machine learning model could further improve the accuracy of diagnostic chest CT for COVID-19. Further candidate predictors should be analyzed to improve our model. However, RT-PCR should remain the primary standard of testing as up to 9% of RT-PCR positive patients are not diagnosed by chest CT or our machine learning model. © 2020, American Society of Emergency Radiology.","Chest computed tomography; CO-RADS classification; COVID-19; Emergency Department; Machine learning; Prediction model; Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)",,"32691211","Emerg.

With only one opportunity to obtain samples for identification of a causative agent, it is important to ensure that sampling regimes are optimized to provide the greatest detection, without the expense and redundancy that can arise from over-sampling. This study was performed retrospectively using data from Coronial autopsies over the period 2012–2019 from which swabs from the nasopharyngeal region, trachea and lung parenchyma, in addition to samples of lung tissue, had been submitted for multiplex PCR detection of respiratory pathogens. From 97 cases with all four samples, there were 24 with at least one positive result for viral infection. Some cases had multiple positive results and a total of 27 respiratory tract viruses were identified, of which rhinovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Seventeen of the 27 viral infections (63%) were identified in all four samples. However, in nearly all cases (96%) the nasopharyngeal swab detected the infective agent when the multiplex PCR panel had detected infection in any of the four sample types. A nasopharyngeal swab is considered to be an optimal sample for detection of respiratory tract viral infection. As the samples analyzed were acquired before the appearance of the COVID-19 virus, the applicability of this finding for COVID-19 screening is not established. © 2020, The Author(s).","Lung; Nasopharyngeal; Post-mortem; Respiratory tract; Sampling; Tracheal; Virology",,,"Forensic Sci.

No published treatment to date has been shown to adequately control the inflammation and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, apart from oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation. We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use. Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms.

This US survey of breast cancer survivors characterizes treatment delays early period in the pandemic. Methods: We developed a survey and administered it to 609 adult breast cancer survivors in the US. We used snowball sampling with invitations distributed via social media. We used logistic regression to select a model of delay from a pool of independent variables including race, cancer stage, site of care, health insurance, and age. We used descriptive statistics to characterize delay types. Results: Forty-four percent of participants reported cancer care treatment delays during the pandemic. Delays in all aspects of cancer care and treatment were reported. The only variable which had a significant effect was age (97 (.95, 99), p < 0.001) with younger respondents (M = 45.94, SD = 10.31) reporting a higher incidence of delays than older respondents (M = 48.98, SD = 11.10). There was no significant effect for race, insurance, site of care, or cancer stage. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a pervasive impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer care and a gap in disaster preparedness that leaves cancer survivors at risk for poor outcomes. Delays are critical to capture and characterize to help cancer providers and healthcare systems develop effective and patient–tailored processes and strategies to manage cases during the current pandemic wave, subsequent waves, and future disasters. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Breast cancer; COVID-19; Survey research; Treatment delays",,,"Breast Cancer Res.

Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations: A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts. Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period. This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia. It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns. For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels. These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures. It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a 5-fold increase in total infections. Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed. Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Methods: We launched a survey composed of 25 questions about how COVID-19 has changed the safety and organization of daily activity in Italian radiology units. Results: A total of 2136/10,564 (20.2%) radiologists of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology participated. Two-thirds performed at least one diagnostic/interventional procedure on COVID-19 patients. The 88.1% reported a reduction in the elective imaging volumes, with US, mammography, and MRI having shown the greater decrease (41.1%, 23.9%, and 21.1%, respectively). In 69.6% of cases, institutions had trouble getting personal protective equipment (PPE), especially public hospitals and southern institutions. Less than 30% of participants were subjected to RT-PCR swab test, although 81.5% believed that it should be done on all health workers and 70% suggested it as the most important measure to improve safety at work. Slightly more than half of participants declared to work safely and felt to be adequately protected by their institutions. Up to 20% of northern participants were redeployed to clinical services. The first imaging examination performed by admitted COVID-19 patients was chest radiography in 76.3% of cases. Almost half of participants reported that less than 30% of health workers were infected in their radiology department, with higher rates in northern regions and public institutions. Conclusions: This snapshot of the current situation in Italian radiology departments could be used to harmonize the organization of working activity in order to safely and effectively face this pandemic. Key Points: • More than two-thirds of institutions had trouble getting PPE for health workers, with public hospitals and southern institutions that presented more procurement problems • A substantial drop of imaging volumes was observed in the vast majority of Italian radiology departments, mostly due to the decrease of ultrasound, mammography, and MRI, especially in private practice were working activity was stopped in 13.3% of institutions • RT-PCR swab to health workers was reported as the most suggested measure by Italian radiologists to improve safety at work, as more than 80% of them believed that it should be performed to all health workers, although less than 30% were subjected to this test © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; Survey; Teleradiology",,,"Eur.

Methods: A retrospective study of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia patients without ARDS was performed, and CT scans were reviewed. A COVID-19 pneumonia course diagram was drawn. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the lesion distribution and CT scores, χ2 test was used to compare the CT findings between different stages. Results: A total of 272 CT scans from 100 patients (mean age, 52.3 years ± 13.1) were investigated. Four patients with lung abnormalities on CT first showed negative RT-PCR result and turned positive afterwards. One hundred sixty-nine (62.1%) showed predominantly peripheral distribution. The CT scores of the upper zone (3.4 ± 3.6) were significantly lower than those of the middle (5.0 ± 3.9) and lower (4.8 ± 3.6) zones (p &lt; 0.001). The CT scores of the anterior zones (4.9 ± 4.7) were significantly lower than those of the posterior zones (8.4 ± 6.2) (p &lt; 0.001). In the early rapid progressive stage (1~7 days), ground glass opacity (GGO) plus reticular pattern (58.1%), GGO plus consolidation (43.0%), and GGO (41.9%) were all common. In the advanced stage (8~14 days), GGO plus consolidation (79.8%) and repairing CT signs (subpleural line, bronchus distortion, and fibrotic strips) showed a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05). In the absorption stage, GGO plus consolidation (9.1%) sharply decreased (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: CT imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia showed a predominantly peripheral, middle and lower, and posterior distribution. The early rapid progressive stage is 1~7 days from symptom onset, the advanced stage with peak levels of abnormalities on CT is 8~14 days, and the abnormalities started to improve after 14 days. Key Points: • The course of COVID-19 pneumonia consists of three stages: 1~7 days is the early rapid progressive stage, 8~14 days is the advanced stage, and after 14 days, the abnormalities started to decrease. • In the early rapid progressive stage, GGO plus a reticular pattern, GGO plus consolidation, and GGO were all common signs; in the advanced stage, signs of progression and absorption coexisted; lung abnormalities showed an asynchronous process with parts with absorption and parts progressing. • Lung abnormalities mainly showed predominantly peripheral, middle, and lower distribution. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Computed tomography; Coronavirus; Pneumonia",,"32367418","Eur.

Isolation and masks are essential to limit human-to-human transmission initially. The nucleic acid test (NAT) of COVID-19 currently was the most reliable established laboratory diagnosis method in clinical. From 8th February to 7th March 2020, 4254 cases were collected for analysis at six nucleic acid collection sites in the community medical team of Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which cover almost all groups who need NAT in Wuhan. Distribution of positive rates in different sites by genders, ages, or occupations were compared.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis on Connecticut nursing home (n = 215) COVID-19 report, linked to other nursing home files and county counts of confirmed cases and deaths. Multivariable two-part models determined the associations of key nursing home characteristics with the likelihood of at least one confirmed case (or death) in the facility, and with the count of cases (deaths) among facilities with at least one confirmed case (death). SETTING: All Connecticut nursing homes (n = 215). PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths among residents. RESULTS: The average number of confirmed cases was eight per nursing home (zero in 107 facilities), and the average number of confirmed deaths was 1.7 per nursing home (zero in 131 facilities). Among facilities with at least one confirmed case, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing (per resident day) was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR] =.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] =.68–.89; P <.001); compared with one- to three-star facilities, four- or five-star facilities had 13% fewer confirmed cases (IRR =.87; 95% CI =.78–.97; P <.015), and facilities with high concentration of Medicaid residents (IRR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.02–1.32; P =.025) or racial/ethnic minority residents (IRR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.03–1.29; P =.026) had 16% and 15% more confirmed cases, respectively, than their counterparts. Among facilities with at least one death, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing significantly predicted 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths (IRR =.74; 95% CI = I.55–1.00; P =.047). Other focused characteristics did not show statistically significant associations with deaths. CONCLUSION: Nursing homes with higher RN staffing and quality ratings have the potential to better control the spread of the novel coronavirus and reduce deaths. Nursing homes caring predominantly for Medicaid or racial and ethnic minority residents tend to have more confirmed cases. © 2020 The American Geriatrics Society","coronavirus; COVID-19; death; disparities; nursing home",,"32557542","J.

Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. Methods Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Conclusions Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Databased on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; evidence based emergency medicine; human; pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Evidence-Based Emergency Medicine; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32257173","J.

Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies. Objective: To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020. All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care). Results: We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 56 men and 44 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%). The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]). The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings. The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

CASE REPORT: The patient was an 11-year-old girl referred to a children hospital with a dry cough, fever, and headache symptoms, without comorbidity. She was hospitalized following the results of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 1 g every 12 h and the oseltamivir capsule 45 mg every 12 h and azithromycin 250 mg tablet once daily and 200 mg hydroxychloroquine tablet every 12 h for a total of 5 days. After 5 days, the patient had suitable chest status and then was discharged. Azithromycin for 5 days and hydroxychloroquine for 10 days were prescribed for the patient to take at home. The patient’s polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative at baseline through the nasopharyngeal swap, but HRCT of the patient’s was completely consistent with COVID-19 accompanied by consolidation and ground-glass opacity in the left lower and right upper lobes. CONCLUSION: The numerous technical errors in taking the nasopharyngeal swap were the main reasons for the negative PCR. The main lesson from this case report is the high sensitivity and specificity of HRCT compared to the PCR. © 2020 Amir Nasimfar, Rohollah Valizadeh, Mohammad Nanbakhsh Mohammad Nanbakhsh.","Children; Coronavirus disease-19; Novel coronavirus; Polymerase chain reaction","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; azithromycin; C reactive protein; ceftriaxone; creatinine; hydroxychloroquine; lactate dehydrogenase; oseltamivir; adenoidectomy; Article; breathing rate; case report; child; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; consolidation; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; fever; ground glass opacity; headache; heart rate; human; image analysis; lung lobe; polymerase chain reaction; prothrombin time; quarantine; sampling error; school child; throat culture; urea nitrogen blood level",,"Open Access Maced.

This topic is currently arousing great interest, and a growing number of papers are being published. Aim of this study is to investigate the timing of recovery from OD and GD in a real-life population hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods: We followed up by a phone interview the first 100 patients discharged a month earlier from three Italian non-intensive care wards. Results: All 100 patients were Caucasian, mean age was 65 years, 60% were males. Forty-two patients (mean age 63 years) experienced subjective chemosensory dysfunctions (29 OD and 41 GD): the male/female ratio was 2:1; 83% reported a complete or near complete recovery at follow-up. The recovery rate was not significantly different between males and females. The mean duration of OD and GD was 18 and 16 days, respectively. The mean recovery time from OD or GD resulted significantly longer for females than for males (26 vs 14 days, P = 0.009). Among the 42 symptomatic, the mean age of males was significantly higher than that of females (66 vs 57 years, P = 0.04), while the opposite was observed in the 58 asymptomatic patients (60 vs 73 years, P = 0.0018). Conclusions: Recovery from OD or GD was rapid, occurring within 4 weeks in most patients. Chemosensory dysfunctions in women was less frequent, but longer lasting. The value of our study is its focus on a population of hospitalized patients significantly older than those previously described, and the additional data on gender differences. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Age; Ageusia; Anosmia; COVID-19; Recovery; Sex",,,"Eur.

As large numbers of frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) have also been infected and several have died, there is much global concern about protective measures for them, particularly those performing surgery or other procedures with close patient contact. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been and there remains a shortage in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including the N95 filtering facepiece (FFP) respirator, for HCWs. N95 respirators have filtration efficiency of 95% of aerosol particles. Surgical N95 respirators are used where fluid resistance is also required together with respiratory protection, e.g. during surgery or interventional procedures. The shortage of N95 respirators may be overcome by extended use and reuse-comprising rotation and decontamination by approved techniques.

Unfortunately, many of these are not properly tested for efficacy. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the novel COVID-19 Airway Management Isolation Chamber (CAMIC) to contain and evacuate particulate. Study Design: Multi-institutional proof-of-concept study. Setting: Two academic institutions: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC). Subjects and Methods: Smoke, saline nebulizer, and simulated working port models were developed to assess the efficacy of the CAMIC to contain and remove ultrafine particles. Particulate counts were collected at set time intervals inside and outside the system. Results: With the CAMIC on, smoke particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(18) = −0.88, P <.001, WRNMMC; r(18) = −0.91, P <.001, MAMC. Similarly, saline nebulizer particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(23) = −0.82, P <.001, WRNMMC; r(23) = −0.70, P <.001, MAMC. In the working port model, particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(23) = −0.95, P <.001, WRNMMC; r(23) = −0.85, P <.001, MAMC. No significant leak was detected in the smoke, saline nebulizer, or working port model when the CAMIC was turned on. Conclusions: The CAMIC system appears to provide a barrier that actively removes particles from within the chamber and limits egress. Further studies are necessary to determine clinical applicability. The CAMIC may serve as an adjunct to improve health care worker safety and patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2020.","aerosolization; airborne; airway management; COVID-19; personal protective equipment",,,"Otolaryngol.

Outpatients, including ones with various sleep disorders, are left without access to the specialized examinations. This will lead to the late diagnosis and untimely therapy prescriptions. In such conditions, it is relevant to take into account new instrumental diagnostic methods that could be used by the patient themselves to register their vital parameters at home. The obtained data can be transmitted via the Internet to the attending physician for further analysis followed by prescriptions when required. One of these methods is bioradiolocation, which allows noncontact recording of breathing patterns, heart rate and movement of a person during sleep, as well as detection of various sleep disorders and determination of sleep stages. This method is easy to use, and can be recommended for home-screening by patients. Sleep has a significant immunomodulating function, and sleep assessment is important in both patients at risk and afflicted with novel coronavirus infection. Thus, the use of bioradiolocation method at home for non-contact sleep monitoring may be relevant in case of closure of outpatient facilities and will provide the doctor with objective data on sleep patterns and patterns of breathing, motor activity, the presence and amount of respiratory disturbances during sleep. © 2020 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League.

In the present investigation, we assessed nasopharyngeal suctioning as a mitigation strategy to decrease particulate spread during simulated endonasal surgical activity. Methods: Airborne particulate generation in the 1-µm to 10-µm range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real-time during cadaveric-simulated anterior and posterior endonasal drilling and cautery conditions. To test suction mitigation, experiments were performed both with and without a rigid suction placed in the contralateral nostril, terminating in the nasopharynx. Results: Both anterior (medial maxillary wall and nasal septum) and posterior (sphenoid rostrum) drilling produced significant particulate generation in the 1-µm to 10-µm range throughout the duration of drilling (p < 0.001) without the use of suction, whereas nasopharyngeal suction use eliminated the detection of generated airborne particulate. A similar effect was seen with nasal cautery, with significant particle generation (p < 0.001) that was reduced to undetectable levels with the use of nasopharyngeal suction. Conclusion: The use of nasopharyngeal suctioning via the contralateral nostril minimizes airborne particulate spread during simulated sinonasal drilling and cautery. In the era of COVID-19, this technique offers an immediately available measure that may increase surgical safety. © 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC","airborne particulate mitigation; COVID-19; endonasal surgery; nasopharyngeal suctioning; sinonasal cautery; sinonasal drilling",,,"Int.

This study describes the administrative mechanism of joint participation and cooperation during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and the rest of the country by health practitioners and administrative authorities. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative design. An analytical framework based on the theory of policy participation that included stimulus, setting, and position of policy participation was constructed. Qualitative data of policy participation by health practitioners and administrative authorities consisted of publicly available data. Results: Early during the outbreak, from December 2019 to January 2020, three main stages occurred according to the containment situation. The first stage was characterized by limited knowledge of the transmission dynamics of the virus and a consequently weak response. In the second stage, the disease spreads rapidly because of travel during a national festival. In the third stage, particularly when top Chinese leaders delivered instructions to intensify containment efforts, diverse departments initiated joint prevention and control measures to combat COVID-19. Conclusion: The administrative mechanism of joint participation and cooperation was instrumental in avoiding a substantial increase in both cases and fatalities in the initial stage of the outbreak. This joint participation provides valuable experience and initiatives for major public health emergency preparedness, and the new empirical evidence further highlights the importance of policy participation theory in epidemic prevention in other countries. © 2020 Yan and Zhao.","Coronavirus disease 2019; Joint administration; Policy participation; Public health emergency","adaptation; analytic method; Article; China; cooperation; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; epidemic; geographic distribution; government; health care policy; health care quality; hospitalization; human; infection control; infection prevention; knowledge; pneumonia; quarantine; social behavior; stakeholder engagement",,"Risk Manage.

We developed an end-to-end automatic differentiation method based on CT images to identify COVID-19 pneumonia patients in real time. Methods: From January 18 to February 23, 2020, we conducted a retrospective study and enrolled 201 patients from two hospitals in China who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR tests, of which 98 patients tested positive for COVID-19 (118 males and 83 females, with an average age of 42 years). Patient CT images from one hospital were divided among training, validation and test datasets with an 80%:10%:10% ratio. An end-to-end representation learning method using a large-scale bi-directional generative adversarial network (BigBiGAN) architecture was designed to extract semantic features from the CT images. The semantic feature matrix was input for linear classifier construction. Patients from the other hospital were used for external validation. Differentiation accuracy was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: Based on the 120-dimensional semantic features extracted by BigBiGAN from each image, the linear classifier results indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) in the training, validation and test datasets were 0.979, 0.968 and 0.972, respectively, with an average sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 91%. The AUC for external validation was 0.850, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 75%. Publicly available architecture and computing resources were used throughout the study to ensure reproducibility. Conclusion: This study provides an efficient recognition method for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, using an end-to-end design to implement targeted and effective isolation for the containment of this communicable disease. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; BigBiGAN; Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia; Differentiation; Semantic features",,,"Eur.

Methods: We conducted an open-label study of sarilumab in severe COVID-19 pneumonia (PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg) with hyperinflammation (elevated inflammatory markers and serum IL-6 levels). Sarilumab 400 mg was administered intravenously in addition to standard of care and results were compared with contemporary matched patients treated with standard of care alone. Clinical improvement, mortality, safety and predictors of response were assessed at 28 days. Results: Twenty-eight patients were treated with sarilumab and 28 contemporary patients receiving standard of care alone were used as controls. At day 28 of follow-up, 61% of patients treated with sarilumab experienced clinical improvement and 7% died. These findings were not significantly different from the comparison group (clinical improvement 64%, mortality 18%; p=NS). Baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio >100 mm Hg and lung consolidation <17% at CT scan predicted clinical improvement in patients treated with sarilumab. Median time to clinical improvement in patients with lung consolidation <17% was shorter after sarilumab (10 days) than after standard treatment (24 days; p=0.01). The rate of infection and pulmonary thrombosis was similar between the two groups. Conclusions: At day 28, overall clinical improvement and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 were not significantly different between sarilumab and standard of care.

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients.MethodsFrom February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores.ResultsTwo of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation.ConclusionsLT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: From January 21 to February 14, 2020, 98 older patients (≥ 60 years) who had undergone chest CT scans (“initial CT”) on admission were enrolled. Manifestation and CT score were compared between the death group and the survival group. In each group, patients were sub-grouped based on the time interval between symptom onset and the “initial CT” scan: subgroup1 (interval ≤ 5 days), subgroup2 (interval between 6 and 10 days), and subgroup3 (interval > 10 days). Adjusted ROC curve after adjustment for age and gender was applied. Results: Consolidations on CT images were more common in the death group (n = 46) than in the survival group (n = 52) (53.2% vs 32.0%, p < 0.001). For subgroup1 and subgroup2, a higher mean CT score was found for the death group (33.0 ± 17.1 vs 12.9 ± 8.7, p < 0.001; 38.8 ± 12.3 vs 24.3 ± 11.9, p = 0.002, respectively) and no significant difference of CT score was identified with respect to subgroup3 (p = 0.144). In subgroup1, CT score of 14.5 with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 77.3% for the prediction of mortality was an optimal cutoff value, with an adjusted AUC of 0.881. In subgroup2, CT score of 27.5 with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 70.6% for the prediction of mortality was an optimal cutoff value, with an adjusted AUC of 0.895. Conclusions: “Initial CT” scores may be useful to speculate prognosis and stratify patients. Severe manifestation on CT at an early stage may indicate poor prognosis for older patients with COVID-19. Key Points: • Severe manifestation on CT at an early stage may indicate poor prognosis for older patients with COVID-19. • Radiologists should pay attention to the time interval between symptom onsets and CT scans of patients with COVID-19. • Consolidations on CT images were more common in death patients than in survival patients. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronavirus infections; Lung diseases; Mortality; Tomography",,"32524220","Eur.

We sought to determine the utility of lung ultrasound for early detection of pneumonia and for assessment of respiratory failure among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Six patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were enrolled. All had undergone chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) on the day of admission and underwent multiple point-of-care lung ultrasound scans over the course of their hospitalization. Results: Lung ultrasound detected early abnormal findings of representative B-lines in a patient with a normal chest X-ray, corresponding to ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan. The ultrasound findings improved as her clinical condition improved and her viral load decreased. In another minimally symptomatic patient without significant chest X-ray findings, the ultrasound showed B-lines, an early sign of pneumonia before abnormalities were detected on the chest CT scan. In two critically ill patients, ultrasound was performed to assess for evaluation of disease severity. In both patients, the clinicians conducted emergency rapid sequence intubation based on the ultrasound findings without awaiting the laboratory results and radiological reports. In two children, ultrasound was used to assess the improvement in their pneumonia, thus avoiding further imaging tests such as chest CT. Conclusions: Lung ultrasound is feasible and useful as a rapid, sensitive, and affordable point-of-care screening tool to detect pneumonia and assess the severity of respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. © 2020 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.","COVID-19; Pneumonia; Respiratory insufficiency; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Ultrasonography","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; case report; child; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; human; infant; isolation and purification; lung; male; middle aged; pandemic; retrospective study; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography","32668514","Korean J.

By analyzing patients with severe manifestations, it became apparent that 20 to 35% of patients who died had preexisting cardiovascular disease. This finding warrants the important need to discuss the influence of SARS-CoV2 infection on the cardiovascular system and hemodynamics in the context of clinical management, particularly during mechanical ventilation. The SARS-CoV2 enters human cells through the spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is important to cardiovascular modulation and endothelial signaling. As ACE2 is highly expressed in lung tissue, patients have been progressing to acute respiratory injury at an alarming frequency during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Moreover, COVID-19 leads to high D-dimer levels and prothrombin time, which indicates a substantial coagulation disorder. It seems that an overwhelming inflammatory and thrombogenic condition is responsible for a mismatching of ventilation and perfusion, with a somewhat near-normal static lung compliance, which describes two types of pulmonary conditions. As such, positive pressure during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) must be applied with caution. The authors of this review appeal to the necessity of paying closer attention to assess microhemodynamic repercussion, by monitoring central venous oxygen saturation during strategies of IMV. It is well known that a severe respiratory infection and a scattered inflammatory process can cause non-ischemic myocardial injury, including progression to myocarditis. Early strategies that guide clinical decisions can be lifesaving and prevent extended myocardial damage. Moreover, cardiopulmonary failure refractory to standard treatment may necessitate the use of extreme therapeutic strategies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on COVID-19 patients referred to Medical Imaging Centers of Sari, Mazandaran, Iran, on March 2020 for computed tomography (CT) scan. Symptomatic patients were referred to the Medical Imaging Center for diagnosis confirmation through CT scan. In addition to age and sex, HRCT findings were collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) for further evaluations. Results: Out of 552 patients with mean age of 51.2 ± 14.8 years, the male/female ratio was 1.38 to 1. The most common expressive findings in patients were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (87.3%), peripheral distribution (82.4%), and posterior distribution (81.5%). The most conflicting findings in patients were pleural effusion (7.6%), peribronchovascular distribution (7.6%), and lymphadenopathy (5.1%). The peripheral distribution (p = 0.034), round opacities (p = 0.02), single lobe (p = 0.003), and pleural effusion (p = 0.037) were significant in people under and over 50 years of age. Conclusion: In summary, the present study indicated that in addition to GGO, peripheral distribution findings could be a vital diagnostic choice in COVID-19 patients. © 2020, American Society of Emergency Radiology.","Coronavirus 2019; Ground glass; Peripheral distribution; Pleural effusion",,,"Emerg.

We aimed to describe epidemiological features and clinical course in Shanghai. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 325 cases admitted at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, between January 20 and February 29, 2020. Results: 47.4% (154/325) had visited Wuhan within 2 weeks of illness onset. 57.2% occurred in 67 clusters; 40% were situated within 53 family clusters. 83.7% developed fever during the disease course. Median times from onset to first medical care, hospitalization and negative detection of nucleic acid by nasopharyngeal swab were 1, 4 and 8 days. Patients with mild disease using glucocorticoid tended to have longer viral shedding in blood and feces. At admission, 69.8% presented with lymphopenia and 38.8% had elevated D-dimers. Pneumonia was identified in 97.5% (314/322) of cases by chest CT scan. Severe-critical patients were 8% with a median time from onset to critical disease of 10.5 days. Half required oxygen therapy and 7.1% high-flow nasal oxygen. The case fatality rate was 0.92% with median time from onset to death of 16 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 cases in Shanghai were imported. Rapid identification, and effective control measures helped to contain the outbreak and prevent community transmission. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Importation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the UK highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Design: Detailed survey information on social encounters from over 5800 respondents is coupled to predictive models of contact tracing and control. This is used to investigate the likely efficacy of contact tracing and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Results: Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission we predict that under effective contact tracing less than 1 in 6 cases will generate any subsequent untraced infections, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36 individuals traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we find that tracing using a contact definition requiring more than 4 hours of contact is unlikely to control spread. Conclusions: The current contact tracing strategy within the UK is likely to identify a sufficient proportion of infected individuals such that subsequent spread could be prevented, although the ultimate success will depend on the rapid detection of cases and isolation of contacts. Given the burden of tracing a large number of contacts to find new cases, there is the potential the system could be overwhelmed if imports of infection occur at a rapid rate. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Healthcare professionals issue less than 20% of all reports suspecting NAI to the responsible authorities. Insufficient knowledge concerning NAI may partly explain this low percentage. The risk of NAI is heightened during health and socioeconomic crises such as COVID-19 and thus demands increased awareness. This review provides an overview and educational material on NAI and its clinical presentation. Methods — We combined a literature review with expert opinions of the senior authors into an educational paper aiming to help clinicians to recognize NAI and act appropriately by referral to multidisciplinary child protection teams and local authorities. Results — Despite the increased risk of NAI during the current COVID-19 crisis, the number of reports suspecting NAI decreased by 42% during the lockdown of the Danish society. Healthcare professionals filed only 17% of all reports of suspected child abuse in 2016. Interpretation — The key to recognizing and suspecting NAI upon clinical presentation is to be aware of inconsistencies in the medical history and suspicious findings on physical and paraclinical examination. During health and socioeconomic crises the incidence of NAI is likely to peak. Recognition of NAI, adequate handling by referral to child protection teams, and reporting to local authorities are of paramount importance to prevent mortality and physical and mental morbidity. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Using an in-situ simulation model, we evaluated laryngoscopist exposure of airborne particles sized 0.3 - 5.0 microns using five aerosol containment devices (aerosol box; sealed box with and without suction; vertical drape; and horizontal drape) compared with no aerosol containment device. Nebulised saline was used as the aerosol-generating model for 300 s, at which point, the devices were removed to assess particle spread. Primary outcome was the quantity and size of airborne particles measured at the level of the laryngoscopist’s head at 30, 60, 120 and 300 s, as well as 360 s (60 s after device removal). Airborne particles sizes of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 microns were quantified using an electronic airborne particle counter. Compared with no device use, the sealed intubation box with suction resulted in a decrease in 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 micron, but not 5.0 micron, particle exposure over all time-periods (p = 0.003 for all time periods). Compared with no device use, the aerosol box showed an increase in 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 micron airborne particle exposure at 300 s (p = 0.002, 0.008, 0.002, respectively). Compared with no device use, neither horizontal nor vertical drapes showed any difference in any particle size exposure at any time. Finally, when the patient coughed, use of the aerosol box resulted in a marked increase in airborne particle exposure compared with other devices or no device use. In conclusion, novel devices intended to protect the laryngoscopist require objective testing to ensure they are fit for purpose and do not result in increased airborne particle exposure. © 2020 Association of Anaesthetists","aerosol box; barrier device; COVID-19; intubation; particle counts; personal protective equipment; PPE",,"32559315","Anaesthesia",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087712472

Patients and methods: The QoL of 68 RA patients was assessed using Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS-SF36) scale across the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) components scores. The disease activity score (DAS28) was considered. Patients accepting to participate and having a mean of communication via social network, in particular WhatsApp were included. Results: The mean age of the patients was 49.9 ± 12.1 years (11–83 years) and were 65 females and 3 males. The mean DAS-28 at the start of the restriction measures was 3.4 ± 1.5, the mean PCS and MCS were 71.1 ± 20.3 and 67.1 ± 16.02 respectively and became 4.7 ± 2.04, 38.1 ± 4.96 and 36.8 ± 3.8 respectively. After 2 months, none of the RA patients presented with classic symptoms of COVID-19 infection. 8 patients were screened by Rapid Diagnostic Test and Reverse Transcription‐Polymerase Chain Reaction. Only 1 case was positive but asymptomatic. All patients had altered QoL according to MOS-SF36. Factors associated with this deterioration were stress related to SARS-CoV2 isolation (p = 0.001), stress of having an activity flare-up (p = 0.001), fear of being stigmatized (p = 0.009). The economic factors were significantly associated with temporary unemployment, decrease in monthly income, and drug discontinuation (p = 0.001, p = 0.002 and p = 0.046 respectively). Conclusion: The impact of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic is negative on the QoL of RA patients and many factors were contributing. © 2020","Benin; Pandemic; Rheumatoid arthritis; SARS-CoV2",,,"Egypt.

In this study, we aimed to develop a noninvasive ARDS monitoring protocol based on traditional quantitative and radiomics approaches from chest CT. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Quantitative and radiomics data were extracted from automatically segmented regions of interest (ROIs) of infection regions in the lungs. ARDS existence was measured by Pa02/Fi02 <300 in artery blood samples. Three different models were constructed by using the traditional quantitative imaging metrics, radiomics features and their combinations, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to test the clinical value of the proposed model. Results: The proposed models were constructed using 352 CT images from 86 patients. The median age was 49, and the male proportion was 61.9%. The training dataset and the validation dataset were generated by randomly sampling the patients with a 2:1 ratio. Chi-squared test showed that there was no significant difference in baseline of the enrolled patients between the training and validation datasets. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of the traditional quantitative model, radiomics model and combined model in the validation dataset was 0.91, 0.91 and 0.94, respectively. Accordingly, the sensitivities were 0.55, 0.82 and 0.58, while the specificities were 0.97, 0.86 and 0.98. The DCA curve showed that when threshold probability for a doctor or patients is within a range of 0 to 0.83, the combined model adds more net benefit than “treat all” or “treat none” strategies, while the traditional quantitative model and radiomics model could add benefit in all threshold probability. Conclusions: It is feasible to monitor ARDS from CT images using radiomics or traditional quantitative analysis in COVID-19. The radiomics model seems to be the most practical one for possible clinical use. Multi-center validation with a larger number of samples is recommended in the future. © The author(s).","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Computed tomography; COVID-19; Quantitative; Radiomics","adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; blood oxygen tension; chi square test; clinical feature; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; female; human; major clinical study; male; metric system; nonhuman; patient monitoring; quantitative analysis; radiomics; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; adult respiratory distress syndrome; algorithm; area under the curve; Betacoronavirus; China; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; image processing; information processing; lung; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; theoretical model; translational research; virus pneumonia; workflow; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Datasets as Topic; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Sampling Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Translational Medical Research; Workflow","32714080","Int.

Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. Methods: The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. Results: Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines. Conclusions: Since the onset of COVID-19, many pregnant and postpartum women report struggling with stress, depression, and anxiety symptomatology. Findings from this pilot study begin to inform future intervention work to best support this highly vulnerable population. © The Author(s) 2020.","disasters; mood disorders; perinatal mental health; postpartum care; prenatal care","adult; anxiety; Coronavirus infection; depression; female; health survey; human; mental stress; middle aged; pandemic; pilot study; pregnancy; pregnant woman; psychological resilience; psychology; puerperium; qualitative research; risk assessment; United States; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Qualitative Research; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Assessment; Stress, Psychological; United States; Young Adult","32674654","J.

Our aim was to provide a detailed account of case characteristics, resource use, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Germany, where the health-care system has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. Methods: In this observational study, adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were admitted to hospital in Germany between Feb 26 and April 19, 2020, and for whom a complete hospital course was available (ie, the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included in the study cohort. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds were analysed. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics, duration of hospital stay, type and duration of ventilation, and survival status. Patients with adjacent completed hospital stays were grouped into one case. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had received any form of mechanical ventilation. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index. Findings: Of 10 021 hospitalised patients being treated in 920 different hospitals, 1727 (17%) received mechanical ventilation (of whom 422 [24%] were aged 18–59 years, 382 [22%] were aged 60–69 years, 535 [31%] were aged 70–79 years, and 388 [23%] were aged ≥80 years). The median age was 72 years (IQR 57–82). Men and women were equally represented in the non-ventilated group, whereas twice as many men than women were in the ventilated group. The likelihood of being ventilated was 12% for women (580 of 4822) and 22% for men (1147 of 5199). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10 021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrhythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (1358 [14%]). Dialysis was required in 599 (6%) of all patients and in 469 (27%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The Charlson comorbidity index was 0 for 3237 (39%) of 8294 patients without ventilation, but only 374 (22%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The mean duration of ventilation was 13·5 days (SD 12·1). In-hospital mortality was 22% overall (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between patients without ventilation (1323 [16%] of 8294) and with ventilation (906 [53%] of 1727; 65 [45%] of 145 for non-invasive ventilation only, 70 [50%] of 141 for non-invasive ventilation failure, and 696 [53%] of 1318 for invasive mechanical ventilation). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients requiring dialysis was 73% (342 of 469). In-hospital mortality for patients with ventilation by age ranged from 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18–59 years to 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older. Interpretation: In the German health-care system, in which hospital capacities have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality has been high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, particularly for patients aged 80 years or older and those requiring dialysis, and has been considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years.

Coronaviruses are a group of well-known respiratory viruses that can cause acute respiratory infections. At the current state, the 2019 novel coronavirus is cited as the most worldwide problematic agent for the respiratory system. According to investigations, people with old age and underlying diseases are at higher risk of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Indeed, they may show a severe form of the disease (with severe acute respiratory infections). Based on the promising role of cell therapy and regenerative medicine approaches in the treatment of several life-threatening diseases, it seems that applying cell-based approaches can also be a hopeful strategy for improving subjects with severe acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus.

These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, fibrosis, etc. Timely diagnosis of lung disease is essential. Many image processing and machine learning models have been developed for this purpose. Different forms of existing deep learning techniques including convolutional neural network (CNN), vanilla neural network, visual geometry group based neural network (VGG), and capsule network are applied for lung disease prediction. The basic CNN has poor performance for rotated, tilted, or other abnormal image orientation. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid deep learning framework by combining VGG, data augmentation and spatial transformer network (STN) with CNN. This new hybrid method is termed here as VGG Data STN with CNN (VDSNet). As implementation tools, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, and Keras are used. The new model is applied to NIH chest X-ray image dataset collected from Kaggle repository. Full and sample versions of the dataset are considered. For both full and sample datasets, VDSNet outperforms existing methods in terms of a number of metrics including precision, recall, F0.5 score and validation accuracy. For the case of full dataset, VDSNet exhibits a validation accuracy of 73%, while vanilla gray, vanilla RGB, hybrid CNN and VGG, and modified capsule network have accuracy values of 67.8%, 69%, 69.5% and 63.8%, respectively. When sample dataset rather than full dataset is used, VDSNet requires much lower training time at the expense of a slightly lower validation accuracy. Hence, the proposed VDSNet framework will simplify the detection of lung disease for experts as well as for doctors. © 2020 The Authors","Capsule network; CNN; COVID-19; Vanilla NN; VDSNet; VGG","Article; classification algorithm; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; human; image analysis; image processing; lung disease; lung nodule; machine learning; recall; spatial transformer network; thorax radiography; validation process; visual geometry neural network; X ray",,"Inform.

Although the aerosol box prolonged the time to successful intubation and decreased the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score when using a direct laryngoscope, the statistically significant differences were clinically irrelevant. When a McGRATH™ MAC and an AWS-S200NK were used, the times to successful intubation and POGO scores were comparable with and without the aerosol box. When using any of the laryngoscopes, there were no statistically significant differences in the Cormack–Lehane grade and peak force to maxillary incisors with and without the aerosol box.

Methods: This was a prospective study that enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) followed at a primary healthcare unit in São Paulo, Brazil. After a brief training in image acquisition, there was further continuous feedback given by a retina specialist during the remote image reading process. Each patient underwent two fundus and one anterior ocular segment images per eye, after mydriasis. Patients were classified according to the need of referral. Results: A total of 627 adult individuals with T2DM underwent retinal evaluation. The population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, diabetes duration 10.7 ± 8.2 years and HbA1c 7.7 ± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol). The most prevalent associated comorbidities were arterial hypertension (80.3%) and dyslipidemia (50.2%). Referral decision was possible in 81.2% patients. Most patients had absent or non-referable DR; the main ocular media opacity detected was cataract. After the 7th day of image acquisition, the daily rate of patients whose images allowed clinical decision was maintained above 80%. A higher HbA1c was associated with referable DR. Conclusions: A low-cost DR screening strategy with a handheld device and telemedicine is feasible and has the potential to increase coverage of DR screening in underserved areas; the possibility of mobile units is relevant for DR screening in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.

We aim to investigate the corresponding clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics between different clinical stages. A retrospective, single-center study of 101 confirmed patients with COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2nd to 28th, 2020 was enrolled; follow-up endpoint was on February 8, 2020. Clinical data were collected and compared during the course of illness. The median age of the 101 patients was 51.0 years and 33.6% were medical staff. Fever (68%), cough (50%), and fatigue (23%) are the most common symptoms. About 26% patients underwent the mechanical ventilation and 98% patients were treated with antibiotics. 37% patients cured and 11 died. On admission, the number of patients with uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia were 2 [2%], 86 [85%], 11[11%] and 2[2%]. 44 of the 86 mild pneumonia progressed to severe illness within 4 days, with 9 patients worsened to critical pneumonia within 4 days. 2 of the 11 severe patients improved to mild condition while 3 others deteriorated.

The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum Methods: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with α< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). Results: All six of the questions - 1) “I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;” 2) “I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;” 3) “I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;” 4)“I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;” 5) “I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;” and 6) “I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles” - showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions - “I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;” and “This training was valuable” - received high scores on the Likert scale. Conclusion: This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.

Transforming public health (PH) faces an interesting challenge. The value created (preventive practices) to fulfill policy makers’ desire to reduce healthcare costs is realized by several external partners with varying goals and is practiced by the public (value in use), which often places low priority on prevention. Methods: This paper uses value lens to argue that PH transformation strategy must align the goals of all stakeholders involved. This may include allowing partners and the public to contextualize the preventive practices to see the value in near time and as relevant. It also means extending the number of partners PH uses and helping them connect with the public to seek shared alignment in shared goals of value fulfillment and value-in-use. Results: Using lessons from Covid-19 and PH experience with partners in four different sectors: business, healthcare, public and community, the paper illustrates how PH transformation strategy can be implemented going forward.

One strategy to overcome these issues is utilizing telemedicine, which is recently made possible technologically by the advancement of internet speed, high speed zooming cameras, and the information storages. In Taiwan, the telemedicine is granted legally by the amendment for Taiwan's Physician Act in 2018. Methods: Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung CGMH) is the first hospital in Taiwan to provide the telemedicine service connecting to Cheng Kung Branch of Taitung Hospital since Nov 2018. Consultation services from Dermatology, ENT, and Ophthalmology have been delivered in the live-interactive and face to face module every week. Results: Dermatology consultation comprises the majorities. In the first year, there were totally 426 dermatology consultation services. Eczema, fungal infections, and scabies infestation were the three most common diseases in the beginning. The disease diagnosis became more diverse after several months, including some ready-to-treat diseases pending correct diagnosis, such as pediculosis, psoriasis, and urticaria. Coupled with dermoscopic images, diseases such as hair loss, pediculosis capitis, skin tumor, and scabies, were diagnosed promptly. The subjective patient improvement rate was more than 75% year-round and the case closure rate was more than 85% year-round. Conclusion: Teledermatology is a promising approach to serve the remote medical-underprivileged regions.

Infectious diseases were seen as a minor problem. This, however, changed in 2020 when the global COVID-19 pandemic broke out and a new danger emerged. The latest events generated a lot of discussion on health hazards associated with international tourism and uncontrolled spread of pathogens across the borders. The major health problems of travelers to developing countries with harsh environmental conditions and endemic infectious diseases include gastrointestinal disorders, dermatoses, respiratory infections and fevers of unknown origin. A medical interview by an experienced physician is the foundation of the post-travel screening process both in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers; the interview should focus on identifying exposure to risk factors (endemic infectious diseases, failure to adopt disease prevention measures, consumption of food or water from unsafe sources, insect bites, animal bites, travelling in large groups, unsafe sex with casual partners). While physical examination (identification of abnormalities) and diagnostic tests (identification of pathogens) can be useful for detecting illnesses and asymptomatic infections as well as assessing the general health condition of a patient, including his immune system.

Study Design: This retrospective, single-center study includes all consecutive pregnant women with confirmed (laboratory-confirmed) or suspected (according to the Chinese management guideline [version 7.0]) coronavirus disease 2019, regardless of gestational age at diagnosis, admitted to the Strasbourg University Hospital (France) from March 1, 2020, to April 3, 2020. Maternal characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted from medical records. Results: The study includes 54 pregnant women with confirmed (n=38) and suspected (n=16) coronavirus disease 2019. Of these, 32 had an ongoing pregnancy, 1 had a miscarriage, and 21 had live births: 12 vaginal and 9 cesarean deliveries. Among the women who gave birth, preterm deliveries were medically indicated for their coronavirus disease 2019–related condition for 5 of 21 women (23.8%): 3 (14.3%) before 32 weeks’ gestation and 2 (9.5%) before 28 weeks’ gestation. Oxygen support was required for 13 of 54 women (24.1%), including high-flow oxygen (n=2), noninvasive (n=1) and invasive (n=3) mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=1). Of these, 3, aged 35 years or older with positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, had respiratory failure requiring indicated delivery before 29 weeks’ gestation. All 3 women were overweight or obese, and 2 had an additional comorbidity. Conclusion: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy was associated with maternal morbidity and preterm birth. Its association with other well-known risk factors for severe maternal morbidity in pregnant women with no infection, including maternal age above 35 years, overweight, and obesity, suggests further studies are required to determine whether these risk factors are also associated with poorer maternal outcome in these women. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19 pneumonia; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; intubation; maternal and neonatal outcomes; maternal morbidity; pregnancy; preterm birth; respiratory failure",,"32553908","Am.

Methods: Patients with fever onset ≤ 7 days presenting were enrolled. Nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by PCR. Virologic data were obtained from the US World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Laboratories System and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). We compared influenza A and B infections identified from SEDSS and WHO/NREVSS laboratories reported by US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region using time series decomposition methods, and analysed coherence of climate and influenza trends by region. Results: Among 23,124 participants, 9% were positive for influenza A and 5% for influenza B. Influenza A and B viruses were identified year-round, with no clear seasonal patterns from 2012 to 2015 and peaks in December-January in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. Influenza seasons in HHS regions were relatively synchronized in recent years with the seasons in Puerto Rico. We observed high coherence between absolute humidity and influenza A and B virus in HHS regions. In Puerto Rico, coherence was much lower in the early years but increased to similar levels to HHS regions by 2017-2018. Conclusions: Influenza seasons in Puerto Rico have recently become synchronized with seasons in US HHS regions. Current US recommendations are for everyone 6 months and older to receive influenza vaccination by the end of October seem appropriate for Puerto Rico. © 2020 The Authors.

Aim: To ascertain the diagnostic performance of FIT in symptomatic adult primary care patients. Methods: Faecal samples from routine primary care practice in Oxfordshire, UK were analysed using the HM-JACKarc FIT method between March 2017 and March 2020. Clinical details were recorded. Patients were followed up for up to 36 months in linked hospital records for evidence of benign and serious (colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas and bowel inflammation) colorectal disease. The diagnostic accuracy of FIT is reported by gender, age group and FIT threshold. Results: In 9896 adult patients with at least 6-month follow-up, a FIT result ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces had a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 90.5% (95% CI 84.9%-96.1%), specificity 91.3% (90.8%-91.9%), positive predictive value (PPV) 10.1% (8.15%-12.0%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 99.9% (99.8%-100.0%). The PPV and specificity for serious colorectal disease were higher and the sensitivity and NPV lower than for colorectal cancer alone. The area under the curve for all adults did not change substantially by gender or by increasing the minimum age of testing. Using ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces, 10% of adults would be investigated to detect 91% of cancers, a number needed to scope of ten to detect one cancer. Using ≥7, ≥50 and ≥150 µg Hb/g faeces, 11%, 4% and 3% of adults would be investigated, and 91%, 74% and 54% cancers detected, respectively. Conclusion: A FIT threshold of ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces would be appropriate to triage adult patients presenting to primary care with symptoms of serious colorectal disease. FIT may be used to reprioritise patients referred with colorectal cancer symptoms whose investigations have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Authors.

Hypertension is also a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Self-report, remotely from the clinic, becomes even more essential when patients are encouraged to avoid visiting the clinic as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reporting of height and weight is suspected of leading to underestimation of obesity prevalence in the population; however, it has not been well studied in the elderly population.The Health Belief Model tries to predict and explain decision making of patients based on the patient's health beliefs.Methods:Residents of a retirement home network filled a questionnaire about their health beliefs regarding hypertension and obesity and self-reported their height, weight, and blood pressure. Blood pressure, height, and weight were then measured and compared to the patients' self-reporting.Findings:Ninety residents, aged 84.90 ± 5.88, filled the questionnaire. From a clinical perspective, the overall gap between the measured and the self-reported BMI (M = 1.43, SD = 2.72), which represents an absolute gap of 0.74 kilograms and 2.95 centimeters, is expected to have only a mild influence on the physician's clinical evaluation of the patient's medical condition. This can allow the physician to estimate their patient's BMI status before the medical consultation and physical examination upon the patient's self-reporting. Patients' dichotomous (normal/abnormal) self-report of their blood pressure condition was relatively credible: positive predictive value (PPV) of 77.78% for normal blood pressure (BP) and 78.57% for abnormal BP. The relatively high PPV of BP self-reporting demonstrates an option for the physician to recognize patients at risk. Regression analysis found no correlation between the anthropometric parameters and the Health Belief Model. © The Author(s) 2020.","blood pressure; BMI; elderly; Health Belief Model; self-reporting; tablet","aged; Betacoronavirus; body height; body weight; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; frail elderly; health status; human; hypertension; male; measurement accuracy; obesity; pandemic; questionnaire; reproducibility; self report; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Body Height; Body Weight; Coronavirus Infections; Data Accuracy; Female; Frail Elderly; Health Status; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Obesity; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires","32519636","Prim.

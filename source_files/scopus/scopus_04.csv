In only few weeks it has caused a global pandemic, with mortality reaching 3.4%, mostly due to a severe pneumonia. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the central nervous system (CNS) and mental health outcomes remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of other types of coronaviruses in the brain, especially in the brainstem. There is evidence that the novel coronavirus can penetrate CNS through the olfactory or circulatory route as well as it can have an indirect impact on the brain by causing cytokine storm. There are also first reports of neurological signs in patients infected by the SARS-Cov-2. They show that COVID-19 patients have neurologic manifestations like acute cerebrovascular disease, conscious disturbance, taste and olfactory disturbances. In addition, there are studies showing that certain psychopathological symptoms might appear in infected patients, including those related to mood and psychotic disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Accumulating evidence also indicates that the pandemic might have a great impact on mental health from the global perspective, with medical workers being particularly vulnerable. In this article, we provide a review of studies investigating the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS and mental health outcomes. We describe neurobiology of the virus, highlighting the relevance to mental disorders. Furthermore, this article summarizes the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 from the public health perspective. Finally, we present a critical appraisal of evidence and indicate future directions for studies in this field. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,"32730915","Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. Biol.

Our research tested both the predictor and the consequences of two types of conspiracy beliefs related to the Covid-19 pandemic: (1) general conspiracy beliefs and (2) government-related conspiracy theories. In two studies in Poland (Ntotal = 2726), we found that a perceived lack of individual control predicted both types of conspiracy theories, while a sense of collective control was positively related to general conspiracy beliefs but negatively associated with government-related conspiracy theories. Moreover, general conspiracy theories were related to the acceptance of xenophobic policies and to a less favourable attitude towards outgroups whereas government-related conspiracy theories were not. Additionally, people who believed in conspiratorial governments less frequently indicated that they used prevention methods, such as social distancing and handwashing. Our research demonstrates the importance of considering the content of various conspiracy theories when studying their social effects and potential causes.

It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies. © 2020 The Authors.

In order to capture airborne SARS-CoV-2, the liquid impinger biosampler was used to take fourteen air samples in different wards of the indoor air of the hospital.

Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of “one health” approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Environment; Environmental impacts; One health; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2","Disease control; Diseases; Ecosystems; Health risks; Pollution; Viruses; Cause-effect relationships; Climatic factors; Ecosystem services; Environmental factors; Immunological response; Infectious disease; Particulate Matter; Smart technology; Environmental management; air quality; COVID-19; disease control; disease spread; disease transmission; environmental conditions; environmental management; epidemic; future prospect; pollution effect; public health; respiratory disease; viral disease; air pollution; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental management; human; liquid waste; nonhuman; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; solid waste; wildlife; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

A new research direction is attracting a significant amount of attention in the academic community of environmental sciences and engineering, in which rapid community-level monitoring could be achieved by applying the methodology of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). Given the fact that the development of a mass balance on the total number of viral RNA copies in wastewater samples and the infected stool specimens is the heart of WBE, the result of the quantitative RNA detection in wastewater has to be highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable. Thus, applying effective concentration methods before the subsequent RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection is a must-have procedure for the WBE. This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported COVID-19 wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the PEG-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration. In the end, two easy and well-proven concentration strategies are recommended as below, aiming to maximize the practical significance and operational effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration from wastewater samples.Strategy1: Prefiltration-Salt addition-Electronegative membrane filtration (for initial volume ≤ 50 mL).Strategy2: Prefiltration-PEG-based separation-Overnight standing (for initial volume from 50 to 1000 mL). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 wastewater based epidemiology; Electronegative membrane filtration; PEG-based separation; Precondition; Primary concentration; Ultrafiltration","Diseases; Health risks; Microfiltration; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Viruses; Concentration method; Effective concentration; Electrostatically charged; Environmental science; Global public health; Membrane filtrations; Operational effectiveness; Virus concentration methods; Water filtration; macrogol; virus RNA; concentration (composition); COVID-19; epidemiology; literature review; public health; RNA; wastewater treatment; Article; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental monitoring; environmental science; epidemic; gene dosage; nonhuman; pandemic; phase separation; priority journal; public health problem; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; static electricity; ultrafiltration; virus detection; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus","32768768","Sci.

Hourly traffic, air pollutants, and meteorological data on/near a major freeway in the downtown of Seattle, Washington, were collected for five weeks before and ten weeks after the Washington Stay Home Order (SHO) was enacted, respectively (February 17–May 31, 2020). The pollutants between pre- and post-SHO periods were compared, and their differences were statistically tested. Besides, first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models were developed to reveal the impacts specific to the change of traffic due to the COVID-19 responses while controlling for meteorological conditions. Results indicate that compared with those in the post-SHO period, the median traffic volume and road occupancy decreased by 37% and 52%, respectively. As for pollutants, the median BC and PM2.5 levels significantly decreased by 25% and 33%, relatively, while NO, NO2, NOx, and CO decreased by 33%, 29%, 30%, and 17%, respectively. In contrast, neither size-resolved UFPs nor total UFPs showed significant changes between the two periods, although larger particles (≥115.5 nm) decreased by 4–29%. Additionally, significant differences were found in meteorological conditions between the two periods. Based on the MAR(1) models, controlling for meteorological conditions, the COVID-19 responses were associated with significant decreases in median levels of traffic-related pollutants including 11.5–154.0 nm particles (ranging from −3% [95% confidence interval (CI): −1%, −4%] to −12% [95% CI: −10%, −14%]), total UFPs (−7% [95% CI: −5%, −8%]), BC (−6% [95% CI: −5%, −7%]), PM2.5 (−2% [95% CI: −1%, −3%]), NO, NO2, NOx (ranging from −3% [95% CI: −2%, −4%] to −10% [95% CI: −18%, −12%]), and CO (−4% [95% CI, −3%, −5%]). These findings illustrate that the conclusion of the COVID-19 impacts on urban traffic-related air pollutant levels could be completely different in scenarios whether meteorology was adjusted for or not. Fully adjusting for meteorology, this study shows that the COVID-19 responses were associated with much more reductions in traffic-related UFPs than PM2.5 in the Seattle region, in contrast to the reverse trend from the direct empirical data comparison. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Meteorology; PM2.5; Traffic; Ultrafine particle (UFP)","Air pollution; Meteorology; Confidence interval; Meteorological condition; Meteorological data; Multivariate autoregressive; Seattle , Washington; Traffic-related air pollution; Traffic-related pollutants; Ultrafine particle; Nitrogen oxides; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; particulate matter; traffic emission; trend analysis; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]","32771792","Sci.

The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, mechanisms underlying immune abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 must be elucidated to guide clinical management of the disease. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.

Till date, there has been no clinically proven vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 and thus the doctors are employing the other well-known techniques, which have previously successfully tackled similar other human coronaviruses. To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, doctors are advising isolation of the infected patients, and also regular washing of hands and the use of face mask for the common people.

The results of studies on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others. Temperature increase and sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on surfaces. When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 °C, the cumulative number of cases decreases by 0.86%.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus not only affects the human respiratory system, but also the gastrointestinal tract. The virus has been found in human feces, in sewage and in wastewater treatment plants. It has the potential to become a panzootic disease, as it is now proven that several mammalian species become infected. Since it has been shown that the virus can be detected in sewage even before the onset of symptoms in the local population, Wastewater Based Epidemiology should be developed not only to localize infection clusters of the primary wave but also to detect a potential second, or subsequent, wave. To prevent a panzootic, virus removal techniques from wastewater need to be implemented to prevent the virus dissemination into the environment.

Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen’s nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,"Cell Death Discov.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085530102

Seven coronaviruses that infect humans have been identified: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the most recently discovered. It has created a severe worldwide outbreak beginning in late 2019, leading to date to over 4 million cases globally. Viruses are genetically simple, yet highly diverse. However, the recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, indicate that there remains a long way to go to identify and develop specific therapeutic treatments. Only after gaining a better understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms can we minimize viral pandemics. This paper mainly focuses on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms also are observed in some patients with COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was reported to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate the digestive symptoms that occur in COVID-19 patients, and the potential pathogenic route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in digestive tract organs (from the oral cavity to the gastrointestinal tract). We investigated the digestive symptoms of 48 patients with COVID-19 and explored ACE2 expression in digestive tract and lung cancers, based on a series of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from public databases. We found that 25% (12/48) of the patients with COVID-19 suffered from digestive symptoms, among which pharyngalgia (7/48) was the most common manifestation, followed by diarrhea (3/48), anorexia (3/48), and nausea (1/48). The bulk tissue RNA sequencing analysis indicated that digestive tract organs had higher ACE2 expression levels compared to the lung, and the expression of ACE2 in the lung increased with age. Single-cell RNA-Seq results showed that the ACE2-positive-cell ratio in digestive tract organs was significantly higher compared to the lung. ACE2 expression was higher in tumor cells compared to normal control (NC) tissues. While in gastric tissues, ACE2 expression gradually increased from chronic gastritis to metaplasia, to early cancer. Our data might provide a theoretical basis for screening the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible population and for the clinical classification of treatment of patients with COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,"Cell Death Discov.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089385946

However, for densely populated countries like India with lower sewage treatment facilities, chances of contamination are extremely high; as SARS-CoVs can survive up to several days in untreated sewage; even for a much longer period in low-temperature regions. With around 1.8 billion people worldwide using faecal-contaminated source as drinking water, the risk of transmission of COVID-19 is expected to increase by several folds, if proper precautions are not being taken.

Therefore, based on the fast and global spread of the virus, urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop preventive and therapeutic drugs. In this regard, treatments addressing the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become a major focus. Notably, while a rapid and well-coordinated immune response represents the first line of defense against viral infection, excessive inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive host immune defense may lead to tissue damage both at the site of virus entry and at systemic level. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in COVID-19 patients. In particular, the massive cytokine and chemokine release, the so-called “cytokine storm”, clearly reflects a widespread uncontrolled dysregulation of the host immune defense. Although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling, a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identification of signaling pathways altered during viral infections may help to unravel the most relevant molecular cascades implicated in biological processes mediating viral infections and to unveil key molecular players that may be targeted. Thus, given the key role of the immune system in COVID-19, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the immune dysregulation might give us clues for the clinical management of the severe cases and for preventing the transition from mild to severe stages. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epidermal growth factor receptor; gamma interferon; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 23; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; myeloid differentiation factor 88; neutralizing antibody; nucleocapsid protein; pathogen associated molecular pattern; RANTES; ruxolitinib; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor; tocilizumab; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 7; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; toll like receptor; adaptive immunity; antiinflammatory activity; Burkholderia pseudomallei; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; cytokine storm; host pathogen interaction; human; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunopathology; innate immunity; JAK-STAT signaling; lung injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; Ruminococcus; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tissue injury; ubiquitination; virology; virus entry; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; intestine flora; molecularly targeted therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; virus pneumonia; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disease Progression; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; T-Lymphocytes; Toll-Like Receptors","32467561","Signal Transduct.

Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2.

The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal–oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV.

However, most of the models used to classify chest radiographs are derived from openly available deep neural networks, trained on large image datasets. These datasets differ from chest radiographs in that they are mostly color images and have substantially more labels. Therefore, very deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) designed for ImageNet and often representing more complex relationships, might not be required for the comparably simpler task of classifying medical image data. Sixteen different architectures of CNN were compared regarding the classification performance on two openly available datasets, the CheXpert and COVID-19 Image Data Collection. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) between 0.83 and 0.89 could be achieved on the CheXpert dataset. On the COVID-19 Image Data Collection, all models showed an excellent ability to detect COVID-19 and non-COVID pneumonia with AUROC values between 0.983 and 0.998. It could be observed, that more shallow networks may achieve results comparable to their deeper and more complex counterparts with shorter training times, enabling classification performances on medical image data close to the state-of-the-art methods even when using limited hardware. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,"Sci.

Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact.

Italy is also a seismically active area, and as such is monitored by a dense permanent network of seismic stations. We analyse continuous seismic data from many stations in northern and central Italy, and quantify the impact of the lockdown on seismic ambient noise, as a function of time and location. We find that the lockdown reduces ambient noise significantly in the 1–10 Hz frequency range; because natural sources of seismic noise are not affected by the lockdown, the seismic signature of anthropic noise can be characterised with unprecedented clarity, by simply comparing the signal recorded before and after the lockdown. Our results correlate well with independent evaluations of the impact of the lockdown (e.g., cell phone displacements), and we submit that ambient-noise seismology is a useful tool to monitor containment measures such as the coronavirus lockdowns. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,"32523080","Sci.

The major functions of HSPs include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides, protecting cells from toxic stress, and presenting immune and inflammatory cytokines. Regarded as a double-edged sword, HSPs also cooperate with numerous viruses and cancer cells to promote their survival. RNA chaperones are a group of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are essential factors for manipulating both the functions and metabolisms of pre-mRNAs/hnRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. hnRNPs involve in a large number of cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, transcription regulation, RNP assembly and stabilization, RNA export, virus replication, histone-like nucleoid structuring, and even intracellular immunity. Dysregulation of stress proteins is associated with many human diseases including human cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s diseases, Alzheimer disease), stroke and infectious diseases. In this review, we summarized the biologic function of stress proteins, and current progress on their mechanisms related to virus reproduction and diseases caused by virus infections.

Based on the experience of Italy, the present article contributes to the strategies aimed at preventing a second virus outbreak. In fact, the mismanagement of municipal solid waste could undermine the strategies during the ease of the lockdown. During the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in Italy, there was a general decrease in the selective collection rate (−15% in one municipality with a well-developed door-to-door collection system). Delays in the publication of guidelines on waste management impacted on the safety of the operators collecting potentially infected waste. Contrarily to expectations, single-use masks and gloves do not have significant impact on waste management, accounting for <1% of the residual municipal solid waste collected annually. However, the dispersion of abandoned masks and gloves outside indoor environments is creating environmental problems. Recommendations on waste management and the protection of waste operators are discussed. Finally, guidelines on the most appropriate waste treatment are presented and analyzed. The results presented in this article show that the MSW management sector has found useful solutions to tackle COVID-19; however, these solutions are not being shared sufficiently.

Recent studies have mostly focused on determining the abundance and diversity of viruses in wastewater influents, in samples from primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment stages, and in final effluents. A few studies have also examined the occurrence and diversity of viruses in raw and digested sludge samples. Recent efforts to improve efficiency of virus detection and quantification methods in the complex wastewater and sludge matrices are highlighted in this review. A summary and a detailed comparison of the pre-treatment methods that have been utilized for wastewater and sludge samples are also presented. The role of metagenomics or sequencing analysis in monitoring wastewater systems to predict disease outbreaks, to conduct public health surveillance, to assess the efficiency of existing treatment systems in virus removal, and to re-evaluate current regulations regarding pathogenic viruses in wastewater is discussed in this paper.

It is also toxic to human health. In this work, HONO concentrations were measured in Shijiazhuang using a Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in ambient Air (MARGA) from December 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020, which covered the heavy air pollution season, the Chinese New Year (CNY) vocation and the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) lockdown period. During &amp; after CNY overlapping COVID-19 lockdown, the air quality was significantly improved because of both the emission reduction and the increase in diffusion ability of air masses. The mean HONO concentration was 2.43 ± 1.08 ppbv before CNY, while it decreased to 1.53 ± 1.16 ppbv during CNY and 0.97 ± 0.76 ppbv after CNY. The lockdown during &amp; after CNY reduced ~31% of ambient HONO along with ~62% of NO and ~36% of NO2 compared with those before CNY after the improvement of diffusion ability had been taken into consideration. Heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on ground surface dominated the nocturnal HONO sources, followed by heterogeneous reaction on aerosol surface, vehicle emission, reaction between NO and OH and emission from soil on pollution days throughout the observation. Except for elevated soil emission, other nighttime HONO sources and sinks decreased significantly during &amp; after CNY. The relative importance of heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on surfaces further increased because of both the decrease in vehicle emission and the increase in the heterogeneous conversion kinetics from NO2 to HONO during &amp; after CNY. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic activities; Concentrations and sources; COVID-19; Heterogeneous conversion; Nitrous acid","Aerosols; Air quality; Emission control; Employment; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Soil pollution; Surface reactions; Viruses; Chinese New Year; Conversion kinetics; Emission reduction; Ground surfaces; Heterogeneous reactions; Hydroxyl radicals; Vehicle emission; Virus disease; Inorganic acids; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous acid; air mass; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; hydroxyl radical; nitrous acid; pollution monitoring; viral disease; aerosol; air quality; Article; Chinese new year; communicable disease control; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; human; kinetics; lockdown; particulate matter; pollution; popular culture; priority journal; reaction analysis; soil; China; Hebei; Shijiazhuang; Coronavirus",,"Sci.

Since recombinant ACE2 protein has been suggested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent, this study was conducted to design an ACE2 protein with more desirable properties. In this regard, the amino acids with central roles in enzymatic activity of the ACE2 were substituted. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis at the interaction interface between the ACE2 and RBD was performed to increase their interaction affinity. The best mutations to increase the structural and thermal stability of the ACE2 were also selected based on B factors and mutation effects. The obtained resulted revealed that the Arg273Gln and Thr445Gly mutation have drastically reduced the binding affinity of the angiotensin-II into the active site of ACE2. The Thr27Arg mutation was determined to be the most potent mutation to increase the binding affinity. The Asp427Arg mutation was done to decrease the flexibility of the region with high B factor. The Pro451Met mutation along with the Gly448Trp mutation was predicted to increase the thermodynamic stability and thermostability of the ACE2. The designed therapeutic ACE2 would have no enzymatic activity while it could bear stronger interaction with Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased in vivo enzymatic degradation would be anticipated due to increased thermostability. This engineered ACE2 could be exploited as a novel therapeutic agent against COVID-19 after necessary evaluations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ACE2; COVID19; In silico; Protein engineering; RBD; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; bioengineering; cell; design; drug; enzyme activity; mutation; protein; viral disease; amino acid substitution; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug design; enzymatic degradation; enzyme active site; enzyme stability; molecular docking; molecularly targeted therapy; mutagenesis; mutational analysis; priority journal; protein binding; protein engineering; structure activity relation; thermodynamics; thermostability; SARS coronavirus","32735992","J.

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; COVID-19; Environmental context; Modes of transmission; Solid waste; Wastewater-based epidemiology","Aerosols; Air quality; Decision making; Sewage; Solid wastes; Transmissions; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Air pollution impact; Atmospheric quality; Environmental contexts; Epidemiological studies; Indoor environment; Mitigation policies; Scientific community; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Diseases; COVID-19; detection method; disease prevalence; disease severity; disease spread; disease transmission; epidemic; pollution effect; respiratory disease; viral disease; wastewater; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; early diagnosis; environmental factor; fomite; human; infection control; medical decision making; pandemic; prevalence; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; solid waste management; virus detection; virus transmission; virus virulence; waste water management; water analysis; water quality; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

Nevertheless, virus presence and infectivity in treated wastewaters, but also in the receiving water bodies are still poorly investigated. In this study, raw and treated samples from three wastewater treatment plants, and three river samples within the Milano Metropolitan Area, Italy, were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by means of real time RT-PCR and infectivity test on culture cells. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in raw, but not in treated wastewaters (four and two samples, respectively, sampled in two dates). The isolated virus genome was sequenced, and belonged to the strain most spread in Europe and similar to another found in the same region. RNA presence in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, probably following the epidemiological trend estimated for the area. Virus infectivity was always null, indicating the natural decay of viral pathogenicity in time from emission. Samples from receiving rivers (three sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to real time RT-PCR, probably due to non-treated, or inefficiently treated discharges, or to the combined sewage overflows.

The results show that: (1) the epidemic spread rapidly from January 24 to February 20, 2020, and the distribution of the epidemic areas tended to be stable over time. The epidemic spread rate in Hubei province, in its surrounding, and in some economically developed cities was higher, while that in western part of China and in remote areas of central and eastern China was lower. (2) The global and local spatial correlation characteristics of the epidemic distribution present a positive correlation. Specifically, the global spatial correlation characteristics experienced a change process from agglomeration to decentralization. The local spatial correlation characteristics were mainly composed of the‘high-high’ and ‘low-low’ clustering types, and the situation of the contiguous layout was very significant.

Stool may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2, even when the respiratory tract becomes negative, and the interaction with the gastrointestinal tract poses a series of questions about wastewater and its treatments. This review aims to understand the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and sewage and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The viral load in the faeces of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at between 5·103 to 107.6 copies/mL, depending on the infection course. In the sewerage, faeces undergo dilution and viral load decreases considerably in the wastewater entering a WWTP with a range from 2 copies/100 mL to 3·103 copies/mL, depending on the level of the epidemic. Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, although no evidence of COVID-19 transmission has been found via this route, could be advantageously exploited as an early warning of outbreaks. Preliminary studies on WBE seem promising; but high uncertainty of viral loads in wastewater and faeces remains, and further research is needed. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, based on RNA sequences and RT-PCR, requires a shared approach on sample pre-treatment and on-site collection to ensure comparable results. The finding of viral RNA in stools does not imply that the virus is viable and infectious. Viability of CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 decreases in wastewater - due to temperature, pH, solids, micropollutants - but high inactivation in WWTPs can be obtained only by using disinfection (free chlorine, UVC light). A reduction in the quantity of disinfectants can be obtained by implementing Membrane-Bioreactors with ultrafiltration to separate SARS-CoV-2 virions with a size of 60–140 nm. In sludge treatment, thermophilic digestion is effective, based on the general consensus that CoVs are highly sensitive to increased temperatures. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; Faeces; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater treatment","Bioreactors; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Sewage; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge digestion; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Gastrointestinal tract; Increased temperature; Infected patients; Membrane bioreactor; Respiratory tract; Sample pretreatment; Thermophilic digestion; Wastewater treatment plants; Diseases; chlorine; virus RNA; concentration (composition); COVID-19; literature review; polymerase chain reaction; RNA; viral disease; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Article; dilution; disinfection; environmental impact; epidemic; feces; gastrointestinal symptom; gastrointestinal tract; human; microbial interaction; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; sludge treatment; solid; temperature; ultrafiltration; ultraviolet C radiation; virion; virus detection; virus isolation; virus load; virus transmission; virus viability; waste water; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

In this short communication, we specifically looked at the possibilities of these transmission routes based on the available literature directly related to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as on the closer phylogenetic relatives such as SARS-CoV-1. The available data suggest that, in addition to human-to-human contact, the virus may spread via fecal-oral and aerosols-borne routes. Existing knowledge states that coronaviruses have low stability in the environment due to the natural action of oxidants that disrupt the viral envelope. Previous recommended dosage of chlorination has been found to be not sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in places where viral load is high such as hospitals and airports. Although there is no current evidence showing that coronaviruses can be transmitted through contaminated drinking water, there is a growing concern on the impact of the current pandemic wave on underprivileged societies because of their poor wastewater treatment infrastructures, overpopulation, and outbreak management strategies.

To mitigate the pandemic, China authority has taken unprecedentedly strict measures across the country. That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM2.5 concentrations exhibited distinct trends in different regions, despite of plunges of NO2 concentrations over the whole country. The steady HCHO concentration in urban area provides sufficient fuels for generations of tropospheric O3, leading to high concentrations of O3, especially when there is not enough NO to consume O3 via the titration effect. Moreover, the SO2 concentration kept steady at a low level regardless of cities. As a conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdown indeed helped reduce NO2 concentration. However, the atmospheric quality in urban areas of China has not improved overall due to lockdown measures. It underscores the significance of comprehensive control of atmospheric pollutants in cleaning air. Reducing VOCs (volatile organic compounds) concentrations in urban areas would be a critical mission for better air quality in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; O3; PM2.5; Sentinel-5","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Remote sensing; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutants; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric pollutants; Atmospheric quality; Comprehensive controls; In-situ measurement; PM2.5 concentration; Tropospheric O3; Air cleaners; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); COVID-19; urban area; urban atmosphere; viral disease; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air quality; Article; atmosphere; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; human; infection control; lockdown; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; remote sensing; China; Hubei; Wuhan",,"Sci.

Historically, it is the first cell line that was approved by the WHO for the production of human vaccines. Comprehensive experimental data on the production of many viruses using the Vero cell line can be found in the literature. However, the vast majority of these processes is relying on the microcarrier technology. While this system is established for the large-scale manufacturing of viral vaccine, it is still quite complex and labor intensive. Moreover, scale-up remains difficult and is limited by the surface area given by the carriers. To overcome these and other drawbacks and to establish more efficient manufacturing processes, it is a priority to further develop the Vero cell platform by applying novel bioprocess technologies. Especially in times like the current COVID-19 pandemic, advanced and scalable platform technologies could provide more efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet the global vaccine demand. Herein, we review the prevailing literature on Vero cell bioprocess development for the production of viral vectors and vaccines with the aim to assess the recent advances in bioprocess development.

Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, resulting in healthcare facilities bearing heavy burdens and severe restrictive measures. Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%; P<0.05). The most contaminated surfaces were hand sanitizer dispensers (100.0%), medical equipment (50.0%), medical equipment touch screens (50.0%), shelves for medical equipment (40.0%), bedrails (33.3%), and door handles (25.0%).

In this study, we compared the qRT-PCR and ddPCR in detecting of residual virus that existed on the object surfaces from sample transportation and reception related facilities, testing related instruments, personal protective equipment and other facilities in nucleic acid testing laboratory. All samples were negative by qRT-PCR, in contrast, 13 of 61 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by ddPCR.

Our results showed large reductions in primary aerosol species associated with traffic, cooking and coal combustion emissions by 30–50% on average during the CNY, while the decreases in secondary aerosol species were much small (5–12%). These results point towards a future challenge in mitigating secondary air pollution because the reduced gaseous precursors may not suppress secondary aerosol formation efficiently under stagnant meteorological conditions. By analyzing the long-term measurements from 2012 to 2020, we found considerable increases in the ratios of nitrate to sulfate, secondary to primary OA, and sulfur and nitrogen oxidation capacity despite the overall decreasing trends in mass concentrations of most aerosol species, suggesting that the decreases in anthropogenic emissions have facilitated secondary formation processes during the last decade. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the chemical responses of secondary aerosol to the changes in anthropogenic emissions under complex meteorological environment is essential for future mitigation of air pollution in China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Emission changes; Primary emissions; Secondary formation","Air quality; Coal combustion; Particulate emissions; Sulfur compounds; Aerosol-particle composition; Air pollution in chinas; Anthropogenic emissions; Combustion emissions; Gaseous precursors; Long-term measurements; Meteorological condition; Substantial reduction; Aerosols; nitrate; sulfate; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease spread; viral disease; air pollution; air quality; Article; chemical composition; China; combustion; cooking; coronavirus disease 2019; exhaust gas; leisure; meteorology; oxidation; pandemic; pollution monitoring; priority journal; Beijing [China]; China; Coronavirus",,"Sci.

As of June 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has had a documented effect of over 6 million cases world-wide, amounting to over 370,000 deaths (World Health Organization, 2020. Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Situation. http://https://covid19.who.int/). Consequently, the high demand for testing has resulted in a depletion of commercially available consumables, including the recommended swabs and viral transport media (VTM) required for nasopharyngeal sampling. Therefore, the potential use of unvalidated alternatives must be explored to address the global shortage of testing supplies. To tackle this issue, we evaluated the utility of different swabs and transport mediums for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. This study compared the performance of six swabs commonly found in primary and tertiary health care settings (PurFlock Ultra, FLOQSwab, Puritan Pur-Wraps cotton tipped applicators, Puritan polyester tipped applicators, MedPro 6” cotton tipped applicators, and HOLOGIC Aptima) for their efficacy in testing for SARS-CoV-2. Separately, the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was completed from different transport mediums (DMEM, PBS, 100 % ethanol, 0.9 % normal saline and VTM), which were kept up to three days at room temperature (RT). The results indicate that there is no meaningful difference in viral yield from different swabs and most transport mediums for the collection and detection of SARS-CoV-2, indicating swab and medium alternatives could be used if supplies run out. © 2020","Diagnostic testing; SARS-CoV-2; Swab",,"32781008","J.

With the global pandemic, the lack of efficient rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing tools has hindered the public opportunely response to the emerging viral threat. Herein, a DNA nanoscaffold hybrid chain reaction (DNHCR)-based nucleic acid assay strategy is reported for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In this method, the DNA nanoscaffolds have been first constructed by the self-assembly of long DNA strands and self-quenching probes (H1). Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will initiate the hybridization of H1 and free H2 DNA probes along the nanoscaffold, and an illuminated DNA nanostring is instantly obtained. By taking advantages of the localization design of the H1 probes and the temperature tolerance of the isothermal amplification, the proposed DNHCR method can detect target at short responding time (within 10 min) and mild condition (15 °C–35 °C). Moreover, the reliability of DNHCR method in serum and saliva samples have also been validated. Therefore, DNHCR-based method is expected to provide a simple and faster alternative to the traditional SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","DNA nanoscaffold; DNA self-Assembly; Isothermal amplification; RNA detection; SARS-CoV-2","Diseases; DNA; Quenching; RNA; Isothermal amplifications; Molecular diagnostics; Nucleic acid assays; Rapid detection; Responding time; Self-quenching; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Temperature tolerance; Polymerase chain reaction; molecular scaffold; virus RNA; Article; blood sampling; coronavirus disease 2019; DNA hybridization; DNA strand; human; loop mediated isothermal amplification; nucleic acid analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; saliva analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thermoregulation; virus detection",,"Biosens.

This paper proposes a critical review of the state of the art regarding studies on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and sewage sludge, the factors affecting its inactivation and the main proposed treatments. In-vitro tests demonstrated low resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to high temperature, while even significant changes in pH would not seem to determine the disappearance of the virus. In real wastewater and in sewage sludge, to date studies on the influence of the different parameters on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 are not available. Therefore, studies involving other HCoVs such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E have been also considered, in order to formulate a hypothesis regarding its behaviour in sewage and throughout the steps of biological treatments in WWTPs. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater might track the epidemic trends: although being extremely promising, an effective and wide application of this approach requires a deeper knowledge of the amounts of viruses excreted through the faeces and the actual detectability of viral RNA in sewage. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Coronavirus removal; CoViD; Human health; SARS; Sewage sludge; Wastewater","Bioremediation; Sewage sludge; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Biological treatment; Critical review; High temperature; In-vitro tests; Low resistance; Real wastewater; SARS coronavirus; State of the art; Diseases",,"Process Saf.

This study resorted to the emerging discipline of immunoinformatics in order to design a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Various immunoinformatics tools were utilized to predict T and B lymphocyte epitopes. The epitopes were channeled through a filtering pipeline comprised of antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cytokine inducibility evaluation with the goal of selecting epitopes capable of generating both T and B cell-mediated immune responses. Molecular docking simulation between the epitopes and their corresponding MHC molecules was carried out. 13 epitopes, a highly immunogenic adjuvant, elements for proper sub-cellular trafficking, a secretion booster, and appropriate linkers were combined for constructing the vaccine. The vaccine was found to be antigenic, almost neutral at physiological pH, non-toxic, non-allergenic, capable of generating a robust immune response and had a decent worldwide population coverage.

Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21 days could be considered as a sort of positivity detection time, meaning that the mobility restrictions quarantine commonly set at 14 days, defined only according to incubation-based epidemiological considerations, is underestimated (possible delays between contagion and detection) as a containment policy and may not always contribute to effectively slowing down the spread of virus worldwide.

In addition, the high spreading rate of COVID-19 increased the need for a fast system for the diagnosis of cases. For this purpose, interest in various computer-aided (such as CNN, DNN, etc.) deep learning models has been increased. In these models, mostly radiology images are applied to determine the positive cases. Recent studies show that, radiological images contain important information in the detection of coronavirus. In this study, a novel artificial neural network, Convolutional CapsNet for the detection of COVID-19 disease is proposed by using chest X-ray images with capsule networks. The proposed approach is designed to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases with binary classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings), and multi-class classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings, and Pneumonia). The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.24%, and 84.22% for binary class, and multi-class, respectively. It is thought that the proposed method may help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 disease and increase the diagnostic performance. In addition, we believe that the proposed method may be an alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 by providing fast screening. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Capsule networks; Chest x-ray images; Coronavirus; Deep learning","Computer aided instruction; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Artificial neural network approach; Binary classification; Chest X-ray image; Devastating effects; Diagnostic performance; Learning models; Multi-class classification; Radiological images; Diagnosis",,"Chaos Solitons Fractals",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088050777

The international community tries to find, apply, or design novel methods for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients as soon as possible. Currently, a reliable method for the diagnosis of infected patients is a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The method is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, designing novel methods is important. In this paper, we used three deep learning-based methods for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients with the use of X-Ray images of lungs. For the diagnosis of the disease, we presented two algorithms include deep neural network (DNN) on the fractal feature of images and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods with the use of the lung images, directly. Results classification shows that the presented CNN architecture with higher accuracy (93.2%) and sensitivity (96.1%) is outperforming than the DNN method with an accuracy of 83.4% and sensitivity of 86%. In the segmentation process, we presented a CNN architecture to find infected tissue in lung images.

Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and laboratory data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. Models were tested with 18 laboratory findings from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches.

Not only the rate and pattern of contagion that threaten our sense of healthy living but also the safety measures put in place for containing the spread of the virus may require social distancing. Three different measures to counteract this pandemic situation have emerged, namely: (i) vaccination, (ii) herd immunity development, and (iii) lockdown. As the first measure is not ready at this stage and the second measure is largely considered unreasonable on the account of the gigantic number of fatalities, a vast majority of countries have practiced the third option despite having a potentially immense adverse economic impact. To mitigate such an impact, this paper proposes a data-driven dynamic clustering framework for moderating the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 flare-up. Through an intelligent fusion of healthcare and simulated mobility data, we model lockdown as a clustering problem and design a dynamic clustering algorithm for localized lockdown by taking into account the pandemic, economic and mobility aspects. We then validate the proposed algorithms by conducting extensive simulations using the Malaysian context as a case study. The findings signify the promises of dynamic clustering for lockdown coverage reduction, reduced economic loss, and military unit deployment reduction, as well as assess potential impact of uncooperative civilians on the contamination rate. The outcome of this work is anticipated to pave a way for significantly reducing the severe economic impact of the COVID-19 spreading. Moreover, the idea can be exploited for potentially the next waves of corona virus-related diseases and other upcoming viral life-threatening calamities. © 2020","Covid-19; Dynamic clustering; Lockdown; Pandemic","Clustering algorithms; Losses; Reduction; Viruses; Clustering problems; Dynamic clustering; Dynamic clustering algorithm; Economic impacts; Extensive simulations; Intelligent fusion; Potential impacts; Safety measures; Economic and social effects",,"Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087855177

The fact that RT-PCR test kits are limited in number, the test results are obtained in a long time, and the high probability of healthcare personnel becoming infected with the disease during the test, necessitates the use of other diagnostic methods as an alternative to these test kits.

Within four months since outbreak in December 2019, over 2.6 million people have been infected across 210 countries around the globe with over 180,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60–140 nm with mean size of 100 nm (i.e. nano-aerosol). The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95, N99 and N100 respirators set at 300-nm aerosol, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100-nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the fast-spreading, deadly airborne coronavirus, especially COVID-19, with our target aerosol size set at 100 nm (nano-aerosol), and not 300 nm. The virus and its attached aerosol were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50–500 nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers, which were uniform in diameter, straight and bead-free, were produced with average fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525 nm, respectively, with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently electrostatically charged by corona discharge. The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency yet much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules with lower fiber packing density, with each module separated by a permeable, electrical-insulator material, the electrical interference between neighboring charged fibers was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter together with lower fiber packing density in each module both further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amounts of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required larger amounts of fibers per module to compensate for the poorer performance provided it did not incur significantly additional pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100-nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop not to exceed 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18 Pa (1.9 mm water) while another filter meeting the 30 Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, as well as nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to undesirable chronic diseases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","100 nm; Air filtration; Charged fibers; COVID-19; Electret; Iso-quality factor; Multilayering/multi-modules; Nano-aerosols; Novel coronavirus; PVDF nanofiber filter","Aerosols; Air quality; Drops; Efficiency; Electric corona; Electrostatics; Fibers; Nanofibers; Pressure drop; Sodium chloride; Viruses; Additional pressure drops; Atmospheric pollutants; Average fiber diameters; Electrical insulators; Electrical interference; Electrostatically charged; Fiber packing densities; World Health Organization; Air filters",,"Sep.

This paper statistically analyses the impact of relaxation during Lockdown III and IV on coronavirus disease (COVID) spread in India using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) to forecast the number of active cases using time series analysis and hence the required medical infrastructure for the period of next six months. The Group Method of Data Handling is a novel self organized data mining technique with data driven adaptive learning capability which grasps the auto correlative relations between the samples and gives a high forecasting accuracy irrespective of the length and stochasticity of a time series. The GMDH model has been first validated and standardized by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively. Thereafter, the number of active cases has been forecasted for the rest of 2020 to predict the impact of lockdown relaxation on spread of COVID-19 and indicate preparatory measures necessary to counter it. © 2020","COVID-19; Group method of data handling; Time series forecasting","Data mining; Experimental reactors; Forecasting; Time series analysis; Adaptive learning; Coronaviruses; Effective measures; Forecasting accuracy; Group method of data handling; Medical infrastructure; Statistically analysis; Stochasticity; Data handling",,"Chaos Solitons Fractals",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089348039

During this period, the research on the relevant topics of COVID-19 and emotional expressions published on social media can provide decision support for the management and control of large-scale public health events. The research assisted the analysis of microblog text topics with the help of the LDA model, and obtained 8 topics (“origin”, “host”, “organization”, “quarantine measures”, “role models”, “education”, “economic”, “rumor”) and 28 interactive topics. Obtain data through crawler tools, with the help of big data technology, social media topics and emotional change characteristics are analyzed from spatiotemporal perspectives. The results show that: (1) “Double peaks” feature appears in the epidemic topic search curve. Weibo on the topic of the epidemic gradually reduced after January 24. However, the proportion of epidemic topic searches has gradually increased, and a “double peaks” phenomenon appeared within a week; (2) The topic changes with time and the fluctuation of the topic discussion rate gradually weakens. The number of texts on different topics and interactive topics changes with time. At the same time, the discussion rate of epidemic topics gradually weakens; (3) The political and economic center is an area where social media is highly concerned. The areas formed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei have published more microblog texts. The spatial division of the number of Weibo social media texts has a high correlation with the economic zone division; (4) The existence of the topic of “rumor” will enable people to have more communication and discussion. The interactive topics of “rumors” always have higher topic popularity and low emotion text expressions.

Further considering the severe impact of COVID-19 crisis, the current study aims to develop a numerical strategy to optimize physical environment in courtyard, including distributions of airborne pollutant, drought sensation and infection risk. Experimental data from literature was used to validate the numerical models.

In these days, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the air has become a controversial topic among scientists. Various organizations provide standard methods for monitoring biological agents in the air. Nevertheless, there has been no standard recommended method for sampling and determination of viruses in air. This manuscript aimed at reviewing published papers for sampling and detection of corona viruses, especially SARS-Cov-2 as a global health concern. It was found that SARS-Cov 2 was present in some air samples that were collected from patient's rooms in hospitals. This result warrants its airborne transmission potential. However, due to the fact that in the most reviewed studies, sampling was performed in the patient's room, it seems difficult to discriminate whether it is airborne or is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Moreover, some other disrupting factors such as patient distance from the sampler, using protective or oxygen masks by patients, patient activities, coughing and sneezing during sampling time, air movement, air conditioning, sampler type, sampling conditions, storage and transferring conditions, can affect the results. About the sampling methods, most of the used samplers such as PTFE filters, gelatin filers and cyclones showed suitable performance for trapping SARS-Co and MERS-Cov viruses followed by PCR analysis. © 2020","Air; Sampling; SARS-Cov-2; Virus","Air conditioning; Air quality; Viruses; Airborne transmission; Biological agents; Controversial topics; Global health; Patient activities; Sampling conditions; Sampling method; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Diseases; gelatin; COVID-19; detection method; disease transmission; public health; respiratory disease; sampling; severe acute respiratory syndrome; viral disease; virus; air sampling; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; digital polymerase chain reaction; flow rate; human; limit of detection; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sneezing; storage; transmission electron microscopy; virus detection; virus transmission; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus","32554029","Sci.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, which cause diseases ranging from common colds to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation of aerosol/droplet and person-to-person contact, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of infected individuals but also in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA); SARS-CoV-2; Virus detection method; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","Health risks; Risk assessment; RNA; Transmissions; Viruses; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Detection and quantifications; Gastrointestinal symptoms; Human health risk assessment; Model based approach; Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; World Health Organization; Diseases; virus RNA; COVID-19; disease transmission; epidemiology; health risk; public health; research work; respiratory disease; risk assessment; viral disease; wastewater; cell culture; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; epidemic; feces analysis; gastrointestinal symptom; health hazard; human; infection risk; nonhuman; occupational hazard; priority journal; respiratory virus; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survival factor; viral plaque assay; virus detection; virus shedding; virus transmission; waste water; water sampling; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

The twenty first century is yet again witnessing a gross global pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally no vaccines or drug specific to COVID-19 is available. Corona viruses have been in mutual relationship with humans and other hosts over many decades though aggressive zoonotic strains have caused havoc. Zoonotic emergent corona viruses prior to SARS-COV-2 included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), with the former leading to aggressive infectious spread and the later with high mortality rate. Although they emerged in the early period of the twenty first century, resilient biomedical and expertise in pharmaceutical domain could not appropriate any proprietary therapeutics. Studies envisaged towards curtailing their spread employed different stages of the virus life cycle with all zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) sharing genomic and structural similarities. Hence the strategies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could prove effective against the recent outbreak of SAR-CoV-2. The review unravels key events involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 while highlighting the possible avenues of therapy.

Hence, we devised a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mRT-LAMP) coupled with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) assay (mRT-LAMP-LFB) for diagnosing COVID-19. Using two LAMP primer sets, the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified in a single-tube reaction, and detected with the diagnosis results easily interpreted by LFB. In presence of FITC (fluorescein)-/digoxin- and biotin-labeled primers, mRT-LAMP produced numerous FITC-/digoxin- and biotin-attached duplex amplicons, which were determined by LFB through immunoreactions (FITC/digoxin on the duplex and anti-FITC/digoxin on the test line of LFB) and biotin/treptavidin interaction (biotin on the duplex and strptavidin on the polymerase nanoparticle). The accumulation of nanoparticles leaded a characteristic crimson band, enabling multiplex analysis of ORF1ab and N gene without instrumentation. The limit of detection (LoD) of COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB was 12 copies (for each detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33 oropharynx swab samples collected from COVID-19 patients), and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96 oropharynx swab samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients). The total diagnostic test can be completed within 1 h from sample collection to result interpretation.

Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (A–C) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (D–E) centrifugal filter device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) precipitation, and (G) ultracentrifugation. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the recovery efficiency was calculated for each method. The mean MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7%. The most efficient methods were adsorption-extraction methods with MgCl2 pre-treatment (Method C), and without pre-treatment (Method B). The third most efficient method used the Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Method D) and its recovery efficiency was not statistically different from the most efficient methods. The methods with the worst recovery efficiency included the adsorption-extraction method with acidification (A), followed by PEG precipitation (F). Our results suggest that absorption-extraction methods with minimal or without pre-treatment can provide suitably rapid, cost-effective and relatively straightforward recovery of enveloped viruses in wastewater. The MHV is a promising process control for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and can be used as a quality control measure to support community-level epidemic mitigation and risk assessment. © 2020","Concentration method; COVID-19; Enveloped virus; Filtration; Murine hepatitis virus; Recovery; SARS-CoV-2; Untreated wastewater","Adsorption; Centrifugation; Chlorine compounds; Cobalt alloys; Cost effectiveness; Disease control; Efficiency; Extraction; Magnesium compounds; Polymerase chain reaction; Quality control; Recovery; Risk assessment; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Municipal wastewaters; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Recovery efficiency; Reverse transcription; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Ultracentrifugation; Untreated wastewater; Virus concentration methods; Diseases; macrogol; comparative study; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease control; health risk; polymerase chain reaction; risk assessment; viral disease; virus; wastewater treatment; acidification; adsorption; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; extraction; municipal wastewater; Murine hepatitis virus; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; quality control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ultracentrifugation; ultrafiltration; virus concentration; Coronavirus; Hepatitis A virus; Murine hepatitis virus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

Early detection of viruses provides essential information about possible efficient and targeted treatments, prolongs the therapeutic window and hence reduces morbidity. Graphene is a lightweight, chemically stable and conductive material that can be successfully utilized for the detection of various virus strains. The sensitivity and selectivity of graphene can be enhanced by its functionalization or combination with other materials. Introducing suitable functional groups and/or counterparts in the hybrid structure enables tuning of the optical and electrical properties, which is particularly attractive for rapid and easy-to-use virus detection. In this review, we cover all the different types of graphene-based sensors available for virus detection, including, e.g., photoluminescence and colorimetric sensors, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors. Various strategies of electrochemical detection of viruses based on, e.g., DNA hybridization or antigen-antibody interactions, are also discussed.

It is critical to dissect the pathogenetic mechanisms in order to reach a targeted therapeutic approach. Methods: In the present investigation, we evaluated the effects of SARS-CoV2 on human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We used RNA-seq datasets available online for identifying SARS-CoV2 potential genes target on human bronchial epithelial cells. RNA expression levels and potential cellular gene pathways have been analyzed. In order to identify possible common strategies among the main pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and H1N1, we carried out a hypergeometric test of the main genes transcribed in the cells of the respiratory tract exposed to these viruses. Results: The analysis showed that two mechanisms are highly regulated in HBEC: the innate immunity recruitment and the disassembly of cilia and cytoskeletal structure. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3) and dynein heavy chain 7, axonemal (DNAH7) represented respectively the most upregulated and downregulated genes belonging to the two mechanisms highlighted above. Furthermore, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7 (CEACAM7) that codifies for a surface protein is highly specific of SARS-CoV2 and not for SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and H1N1, suggesting a potential role in viral entry. In order to identify potential new drugs, using a machine learning approach, we highlighted Flunisolide, Thalidomide, Lenalidomide, Desoximetasone, xylazine, and salmeterol as potential drugs against SARS-CoV2 infection. Conclusions: Overall, lung involvement and RDS could be generated by the activation and down regulation of diverse gene pathway involving respiratory cilia and muscle contraction, apoptotic phenomena, matrix destructuration, collagen deposition, neutrophil and macrophages recruitment. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bioinformatics; c8orf4; CEACAM7; COVID-19; CSF3; DNAH7; Innate immunity; Respiratory cilia; SARS-CoV2",,,"Exp.

Due to unavailability of specific drugs, early detection of (COVID-19) patients is essential for disease cure and control. There is a vital need to detect the disease at early stage and instantly quarantine the infected people. Many research have been going on, however, none of them introduces satisfactory results yet. In spite of its simplicity, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier has proven high flexibility in complex classification problems. However, it can be easily trapped. In this paper, a new COVID-19 diagnose strategy is introduced, which is called COVID-19 Patients Detection Strategy (CPDS). The novelty of CPDS is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new hybrid feature selection Methodology (HFSM), which elects the most informative features from those extracted from chest Computed Tomography (CT) images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 peoples. HFSM is a hybrid methodology as it combines evidence from both wrapper and filter feature selection methods. It consists of two stages, namely; Fast Selection Stage (FS2) and Accurate Selection Stage (AS2). FS2relies on filter, while AS2 uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a wrapper method. As a hybrid methodology, HFSM elects the significant features for the next detection phase. The second contribution is an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbor (EKNN) classifier, which avoids the trapping problem of the traditional KNN by adding solid heuristics in choosing the neighbors of the tested item. EKNN depends on measuring the degree of both closeness and strength of each neighbor of the tested item, then elects only the qualified neighbors for classification. Accordingly, EKNN can accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on those significant features selected by HFSM technique. Extensive experiments have been done considering the proposed detection strategy as well as recent competitive techniques on the chest CT images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed detection strategy outperforms recent techniques as it introduces the maximum accuracy rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; COVID-19; Feature selection; KNN","Computerized tomography; Disease control; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Feature selection methods; High flexibility; Hybrid feature selections; Hybrid methodologies; Infected patients; K-nearest neighbor classifiers (KNN); K-nearest neighbors; Maximum accuracies; Feature extraction",,"Knowl Based Syst",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088107019

We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO3), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO3 (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Heavy metal; Lockdown, Tuticorin, India; Organic pollutant","Escherichia coli; Fisheries; Fluorine compounds; Groundwater; Image enhancement; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Sewage; Thermoelectric power plants; Water quality; Anthropogenic activity; Chemical and biologicals; Electrical conductivity; Environmental improvements; Multi variate analysis; Physico - chemical parameters; Rock water interaction; Total dissolved solids; Hydrochemistry; arsenic; cadmium; copper; fluoride; ground water; iron; lead; nitrate; selenium; surface water; zinc; biological analysis; chemical analysis; epidemic; groundwater; physicochemical property; surface water; water chemistry; water quality; Article; chemical parameters; coastal waters; coliform bacterium; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; electric conductivity; Escherichia coli; fecal coliform; geographic distribution; human; India; industrial area; nonhuman; pandemic; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; quarantine; sewage; Streptococcus; water quality; water sampling; India; Tamil Nadu; Tuticorin; Bacteria (microorganisms)",,"Sci.

As a high infectious pathogen, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in public space is very important for its transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are the main places to deal with the diseases. In this work, we evaluated the exposure risk of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment in order to protect healthcare workers (HCWs). Briefly, air and surface samples from 6 different sites of 3 hospitals with different protection levels were collected and tested for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by reverse transcription real-time fluorescence PCR method during the COVID-19 epidemic. We found that the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 7.7 % in a COVID-19 respiratory investigation wards and 82.6 % in a ICUs with confirmed COVID-19 patients. These results indicated that in some wards of the hospital, such as ICUs occupied by COVID-19 patients, the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 existed in the air and surface, which indicates the potential occupational exposure risk of HCWs. This study has clarified retention of SARS-CoV-2 in different sites of hospital, suggesting that it is necessary to monitor and disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment during COVID-19 pandemic, and will help to prevent the iatrogenic infection and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to better protect the HCWs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; HCWs; Nucleic acid test; Occupational exposure risk; SARS-CoV-2","Biomolecules; Economics; Hospitals; Occupational risks; Polymerase chain reaction; Transmissions; Economic activities; Healthcare workers; Hospital environment; Infectious pathogens; Occupational exposure; Protection level; Reverse transcription; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Diseases",,"Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088539574

This disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2. In the past, other members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have made an impact in China and the Arabian peninsula respectively. Both SARS and COVID-19 share similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing that can become fatal in later stages. However, SARS and MERS infections were epidemic diseases constrained to limited regions. By March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 had spread across the globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, many patients succumbed to pneumonia. Higher rates of deaths were seen in older patients who had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dementia. In this review paper, we discuss the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's-like dementia, and diabetes mellitus. We also focus on the virus genome, pathophysiology, theranostics, and autophagy mechanisms. We will assess the multiorgan failure reported in advanced stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is a need for rapid and accurate diagnostics to better monitor and prevent the spread of COVID-19. In this review, we present and evaluate two main types of diagnostics with FDA-EUA status for COVID-19: nucleic acid testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and serological assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM patient antibodies, along with the necessary sample preparation for accurate diagnoses. In particular, we cover and compare tests such as the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Cellex's qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and point-of-care tests such as Abbott's ID NOW COVID-19 Test. Antibody testing is especially important in understanding the prevalence of the virus in the community and to identify those who have gained immunity.

Here, we established a real-time reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification assay (RT-RAA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 rapidly. The primers and probe were designed based on the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene) sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The detection limit was 10 copies per reaction in this assay, which could be conducted within 15 min at a constant temperature (39 °C), without any cross-reactions with other respiratory tract pathogens, such as other coronaviruses. Furthermore, compared with commercial real-time RT-PCR assay, it showed a kappa value of 0.959 (p < 0.001) from 150 clinical specimens.

The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200–5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, with sequence confirmation of the qPCR product, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 × 103–8.2 × 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 × 102–2.5 × 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; River water; SARS-CoV-2; Wastewater; Wastewater-based epidemiology","Diseases; Polymerase chain reaction; Rivers; RNA; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Environmental surveillance; Membrane adsorption; Pepper mild mottle virus; River water samples; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Treated wastewater; Wastewater samples; Wastewater treatment plants; Extraction; river water; COVI-19; detection method; disease transmission; epidemiology; polymerase chain reaction; river water; RNA; viral disease; wastewater; adsorption direct RNA extraction; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; electronegative membrane vortex; Escherichia coli; Japan; limit of detection; nested polymerase chain reaction; pepper mild mottle virus; plant virus; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; river; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; waste water; waste water treatment plant; water sampling; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Yamanashi; Coronavirus; Pepper mild mottle virus; SARS coronavirus","32783878","Sci.

CVC also strongly antagonizes C–C chemokine receptor type 2b (CCR2b), thereby it has potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. CVC is currently under clinical trials in the patients for treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which immune cell activation and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in its pathogenesis. In this study, CVC was examined for its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in cell cultures and found to be a selective inhibitor of the virus. The 50% effective concentrations of CVC were 19.0 and 2.9 μM in the assays based on the inhibition of virus-induced cell destruction and viral RNA levels in culture supernatants of the infected cells, respectively. Interestingly, the CCR5-specific antagonist maraviroc did not show any anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Although the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by CVC remains to be elucidated, CCR2b does not seem to be its target molecule. Considering the fact that the regulation of excessive immune activation is required to treat COVID-19 patients at the late stage of the disease, CVC should be further pursued for its potential in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 The Author(s)","Cenicriviroc; Chemokine receptor antagonist; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; SARS-CoV-2","cenicriviroc; maraviroc; virus antigen; virus RNA; antigen expression; Article; cell destruction; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; drug mechanism; EC50; in vitro study; pathology; priority journal; selectivity index; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Vero C1008 cell line; virus replication","32739404","Antiviral Res.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089026464

As the WHO declares this new contagion as a pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, the alarming rate of the spawn of the disease in such a short period has disarranged the globe. Standing against this situation researchers are strenuously searching for the key traits responsible for this pandemic. As knowledge regarding the dynamics and host-path interaction of COVID-19 causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently unknown, the formulation of strategies concerning antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control stands crucial. Before designing adequate therapeutic strategies, it is extremely essential to diagnose the disease at the outset as early detection can have a greater impact on building health system capacity. Hence, a comprehensive review of strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis is essential in this existing global situation. In this review, sequentially, we have provided the clinical details along with genetic and proteomic biomarkers related to COVID-19. The article systematically enlightens a clear overview of the clinically adopted techniques for the detection of COVID-19 including oligonucleotide-based molecular detection, Point-of-Care immunodiagnostics, radiographical analysis/sensing system, and newly developed biosensing prototypes having commercial viability. The commercial kits/analytical methods based-sensing strategies have also been tabulated categorically. The critical insights on the developer, commercial brand name, detection methods, technical operational details, detection time, clinical specimen, status, the limit of detection/detection ability have been discussed comprehensively.

We herein demonstrate a homogeneous and isothermal nucleic acid quantification strategy based on C2CA and optomagnetic analysis of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) assembly. The proposed homogeneous circle-to-circle amplification eliminates the need for additional monomerization and ligation steps after the first round of RCA, and combines two amplification rounds in a one-pot reaction. The second round of RCA produces amplicon coils that anneal to detection probes grafted onto MNPs, resulting in MNP assembly that can be detected in real-time using an optomagnetic sensor. The proposed methodology was applied for the detection of a synthetic complementary DNA of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as 2019-nCoV) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) coding sequence, achieving a detection limit of 0.4 fM with a dynamic detection range of 3 orders of magnitude and a total assay time of ca. 100 min.

The viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been quantitatively investigated. In this paper, we use mathematical models to study the pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining the interaction between the virus, cells and immune responses. Models are fit to the data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and non-human primates. Data fitting and numerical simulation show that viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection have a few distinct stages. In the initial stage, viral load increases rapidly and reaches the peak, followed by a plateau phase possibly generated by lymphocytes as a secondary target of infection. In the last stage, viral load declines due to the emergence of adaptive immune responses. When the initiation of seroconversion is late or slow, the model predicts viral rebound and prolonged viral persistence, consistent with the observation in non-human primates. Using the model we also evaluate the effect of several potential therapeutic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Model simulation shows that anti-inflammatory treatments or antiviral drugs combined with interferon are effective in reducing the duration of the viral plateau phase and diminishing the time to recovery. These results provide insights for understanding the infection dynamics and might help develop treatment strategies against COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"Dynamics; Immune system; Mammals; Viruses; Adaptive immune response; Anti-inflammatories; Infection dynamics; Infectious disease; Model simulation; Non-human primate; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic intervention; Diseases; baricitinib; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; COVID-19; disease treatment; drug; epidemic; immune response; infectious disease; numerical model; primate; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; adaptive immunity; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; drug efficacy; human; immune response; inflammation; lymphocyte; mathematical model; nonhuman; persistent virus infection; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction; virus load; virus replication; virus transmission; virus virulence; Coronavirus; Primates; SARS coronavirus","32771304","Math.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for preventing new outbreaks, curbing disease spread, and managing patients. Currently, a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is used to detect the virus in clinical laboratories. However, although this assay is considered to have high specificity, its sensitivity is reportedly as low as 60–70 %. Improved sensitivity is, therefore, urgently required. Methods: We used the primers and single-quencher probes recommended by the CDC (N1, N2 and N3) in the USA and the NIID (N1 and N2) in Japan. In addition, we designed double-quencher probes according to the virus sequence provided by the NIID to develop a further assay (termed the YCH assay [N1 and N2]). Using these assays, we conducted RT-PCR with serially diluted DNA positive controls to assess and compare the detection sensitivity of the three assays. Furthermore, 66 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested to determine the diagnostic performances. Results: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of the RT-PCR was relatively low for the CDC and YCH assays compared with the NIID assay. Serial dilution assays showed that both the CDC and YCH assays could detect low copy numbers of the DNA positive control. The background fluorescence signal at the baseline was lower for the YCH assay compared with the NIID assay. We assessed the diagnostic performance between single- (NIID) and double-quencher (YCH) probes using 66 nasopharyngeal swabs. When the results of YCH-N2 assay were used as a reference, each assay detected SARS-CoV-2 with positive percent agreements of 56 % for NIID-N1, 61 % for YCH-N1, and 94 % for NIID-N2, and 100 % negative percent agreements for NIID-N1, YCH-N1 and NIID-N2. Conclusion: Double-quencher probes decreased the background fluorescence and improved the detection sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Quencher; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","DNA; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic value; dilution; double quencher probe; gene dosage; human; major clinical study; molecular probe; nonhuman; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus detection","32650037","J.

In the first half of 2020, because of the widespread of the COVID-19, researches were focused on the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in water, wastewater, sludge, air, and on surfaces, in order to assess the risk of contracting the viral infection from contaminated environments. So far, the survival of the novel Coronavirus out of the human body has been reported for short time periods (from hours to few days, in optimized in vitro conditions), mainly because of the need of an host organism which could consent the viral attack, and due to the weak external membrane of the virus.

As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors, building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile through the Effective Reproduction Number Rt, identifying different moments in which data was misleading governmental actions.

It is concluded that the detection methods targeting antibodies are not suitable for screening of early and asymptomatic cases since most patients had an antibody response at about 10 days after onset of symptoms. However, antibody detection methods can be combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, and boost vaccine research. Fast, sensitive and accurate detection methods targeting antigens need to be developed urgently. Various specimens for diagnosis or detection are compared and analyzed.

Disease agents are excreted in the urine and feces of infected individuals regardless of disease symptom severity. Wastewater surveillance – that is, monitoring disease via human effluent – represents a valuable complement to clinical approaches. Because wastewater is relatively inexpensive and easy to collect and can be monitored at different levels of population aggregation as needed, wastewater surveillance can offer a real-time, cost-effective view of a community's health that is independent of biases associated with case-reporting. For SARS-CoV-2 and other disease-causing agents we envision an aggregate wastewater-monitoring system at the level of a wastewater treatment plant and exploratory or confirmatory monitoring of the sewerage system at the neighborhood scale to identify or confirm clusters of infection or assess impact of control measures where transmission has been established. Implementation will require constructing a framework with collaborating government agencies, public or private utilities, and civil society organizations for appropriate use of data collected from wastewater, identification of an appropriate scale of sample collection and aggregation to balance privacy concerns and risk of stigmatization with public health preservation, and consideration of the social implications of wastewater surveillance. © 2020","Data privacy; Fecal-oral transmission; Health management; SARS-CoV-2; Wastewater surveillance","Cost effectiveness; Disease control; Effluents; Health risks; Monitoring; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Disease surveillance; Government agencies; Health management; Monitoring system; Population aggregation; Sample collection; Social implication; Wastewater treatment plants; Diseases; civil society; disease severity; effluent; health survey; public health; symptom; viral disease; virus; wastewater treatment plant; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; effluent; human; population health management; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; waste water treatment plant; water sampling; SARS coronavirus","32707307","Water Res.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088142472

Administrators are currently faced with decisions about whether to open during the pandemic and what modifications of their normal operations might be necessary to protect students, faculty and staff. There is little information, however, on what measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing, contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant absenteeism, indicating a need to plan for remote instruction of quarantined students. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Agent-based modeling; Computational epidemiology; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemics; Higher education; Post-secondary education; SARS-CoV-2","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Housing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Agent-based model; Colleges and universities; Contact tracing; Normal operations; Remote instruction; University environment; Students; computer simulation; COVID-19; disease control; disease spread; disease transmission; numerical model; university sector; viral disease; Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental factor; epidemic; exposure; human; infection control; quarantine; simulation; university; virus transmission; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus","32758501","Math.

The proposed approach, xDNN is using prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention. The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources. From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to human users. We tested it on challenging problems as the classification of different lighting conditions for driving scenes (iROADS), object detection (Caltech-256, and Caltech-101), and SARS-CoV-2 identification via computed tomography scan (COVID CT-scans dataset). xDNN outperforms the other methods including deep learning in terms of accuracy, time to train and offers an explainable classifier. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep-learning; Explainable AI; Interpretability; Prototype-based models","Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Deep neural networks; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Object detection; Program processors; Computational resources; Computed tomography scan; Generative model; Internal architecture; Learning approach; Learning architectures; Lighting conditions; User perspectives; Deep learning; article; classifier; deep learning; deep neural network; human; illumination; nonhuman; reasoning; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; x-ray computed tomography",,"Neural Netw.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087911322

Given that the nature of this crisis is a combination of multiple problems, it is substantially different from all other financial crises known to us. It is therefore urgent to re-evaluate the safe-haven role of some traditional asset types, namely, gold, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange and commodities. This paper introduces a sequential monitoring procedure to detect changes in the left-quantiles of asset returns, and to assess whether a tail change in the equity index can be offset by introducing a safe-haven asset into a simple mean-variance portfolio. The sample studied covers a training period between August–December 2019 and a testing period of December 2019–March 2020. Furthermore, we calculate the cross-quantilogram between pair-wise asset returns and compare their directional predictability on left-quantiles in both normal market conditions and the COVID-19 period. The main results show that the role of safe haven becomes less effective for most of the assets considered in this paper, while gold and soybean commodity futures remain robust as safe-haven assets during this pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Cross-quantilogram; Safe-haven assets; Sequential detection; Tail change",,,"Int.

The frequency of these outbreaks, their mortality and associated disruption to normal life calls for concerted efforts to understand their occurrence and fate in different environments. There is an increased interest in the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater from the perspective of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, there is no comprehensive review of the knowledge on coronavirus occurrence, fate and potential transmission in wastewater. This paper, provides a review of the literature on the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater treatment processes. We discuss the presence of viral RNA in feces as a result of diarrhoea caused by gastrointestinal infections. We also reviewed the literature on the presence, survival and potential removal of coronaviruses in common wastewater treatment processes. The detection of infectious viral particles in feces of patients raises questions on the potential risks of infection for people exposed to untreated sewage/wastewater. We, therefore, highlighted the potential risk of infection with coronaviruses for workers in wastewater treatment plants and the public that may be exposed through faulty plumbing or burst sewer networks. The mortalities and morbidities associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic warrants a much more focused research on the role of environments, such as wastewater and surface water, in disease transmission.

Since there is no effective vaccine and treatment for this virus, therefore, the only way to mitigate this infection is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing, community lockdown, quarantine, hospitalization or self-isolation and contact-tracing. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to explore the transmission dynamics and possible control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, one of the Asian countries with a high burden of disease with more than 200,000 confirmed infected cases so far. Initially, a mathematical model without optimal control is formulated and some of the basic necessary analysis of the model, including stability results of the disease-free equilibrium is presented. It is found that the model is stable around the disease-free equilibrium both locally and globally when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Despite the basic analysis of the model, we further consider the confirmed infected COVID-19 cases documented in Pakistan from March 1, till May 28, 2020 and estimate the model parameters using the least square fitting tools from statistics and probability theory. The results show that the model output is in good agreement with the reported COVID-19 infected cases. The approximate value of the basic reproductive number based on the estimated parameters is R0≈1.87. The effect of low (or mild), moderate, and comparatively strict control interventions like social-distancing, quarantine rate, (or contact-tracing of suspected people) and hospitalization (or self-isolation) of testing positive COVID-19 cases are shown graphically. It is observed that the most effective strategy to minimize the disease burden is the implementation of maintaining a strict social-distancing and contact-tracing to quarantine the exposed people. Furthermore, we carried out the global sensitivity analysis of the most crucial parameter known as the basic reproduction number using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) techniques. The proposed model is then reformulated by adding the time-dependent control variables u1(t) for quarantine and u2(t) for the hospitalization interventions and present the necessary optimality conditions using the optimal control theory and Pontryagin's maximum principle. Finally, the impact of constant and optimal control interventions on infected individuals is compared graphically. © 2020","Global sensitivity analysis; Hospitalization/self-isolation; Novel coronavirus; Numerical results; Optimal control theory; Parameter estimation; Quarantine","Cell proliferation; Estimation; Hospitals; Probability; Sensitivity analysis; Viruses; Basic reproduction number; Basic reproductive number; Disease-free equilibrium; Global sensitivity analysis; Necessary optimality condition; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Partial rank correlation coefficients; Pontryagin's maximum principle; Disease control",,"Chaos Solitons Fractals",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087626042

If this matrix is enhanced by being interpreted as a probabilistic Universe of Discourse, it still suffers from two inter-related shortcomings, arising from lack of length/area proportionality and a potential misconception concerning a false assumption of independence between the two underlying events. This paper remedies these two shortcomings by modifying this matrix into a new Karnaugh-map-like diagram that resembles an eikosogram. Furthermore, the paper suggests the use of a pair of functionally complementary versions of this diagram to handle any ternary problem of conditional probability. The two diagrams split the unknowns and equations between themselves in a fashion that allows the use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle such a problem. The method of solution is demonstrated via four examples, in which the solution might be arithmetic or algebraic, and independently might be numerical or symbolic. In particular, we provide a symbolic arithmetic derivation of the well-known formulas that express the predictive values in terms of prevalence, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we prove a virtually unknown interdependence among the two predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. In fact, we employ a method of symbolic algebraic derivation to express any one of these four indicators in terms of the other three. The contribution of this paper to the diagnostic testing aspects of mathematical epidemiology culminates in a timely application to the estimation of the true prevalence of the contemporary world-wide COVID-19 pandemic. It turns out that this estimation is hindered more by the lack of global testing world-wide rather than by the unavoidable imperfection of the available testing methods. © 2020 International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.","Conditional probability; COVID-19; Divide and conquer; Imperfect testing; Length/area proportionality; Mathematical epidemiology; Probabilistic dependence; Ternary problem",,,"Int.

There are two types of nodes, individuals and public places, and disease can spread by social contacts among individuals and people gathering in common areas. We give theoretical results about epidemic threshold and influence of isolation factor. Several numerical simulations are performed and experimental results further demonstrate the correctness of proposed model. Non-monotonic relationship between mobility possibility and epidemic threshold and differences between Erdös-Rényi and power-law social connections are revealed.

Nearly all emerging viruses, including Ebola, Dengue, Nipah, West Nile, Zika, and coronaviruses (including SARS-Cov2, the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic), have zoonotic origins, indicating that animal-to-human transmission constitutes a primary mode of acquisition of novel infectious diseases. Why these viruses can cause profound pathologies in humans, while natural reservoir hosts often show little evidence of disease is not completely understood. Differences in the host immune response, especially within the innate compartment, have been suggested to be involved in this divergence. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that play a critical role in the early antiviral response, secreting effector cytokines and clearing infected cells. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms through which NK cells interact with viruses, their contribution towards maintaining equilibrium between the virus and its natural host, and their role in disease progression in humans and other non-natural hosts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"Curr.

Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250 ml of wastewaters collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations. © 2020","Covid-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; SARSCoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","Diagnosis; Food supply; Network security; Public health; Sewage; Chemical signatures; Clinical diagnostics; Diagnostic testing; Environmental scientists; Financial institution; Large-scale applications; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic treatments; Diseases; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; future prospect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; viral disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; human; international cooperation; mass screening; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Waste Water","32474280","Sci.

This situation highlights the need for rapid, sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays capable of high-throughput operation that can preferably utilize existing equipment to facilitate broad, large-scale screening efforts. We have developed a CRISPR-based assay that can meet all these criteria. This assay utilizes a custom CRISPR Cas12a/gRNA complex and a fluorescent probe to detect target amplicons produced by standard RT-PCR or isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), to allow sensitive detection at sites not equipped with real-time PCR systems required for qPCR diagnostics. We found this approach allowed sensitive and robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, with a sample-to-answer time of ~50 min, and a limit of detection of 2 copies per sample. CRISPR assay diagnostic results obtained nasal swab samples of individuals with suspected COVID-19 cases were comparable to paired results from a CDC-approved quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay performed in a state testing lab, and superior to those produced by same assay in a clinical lab, where the RT-qPCR assay exhibited multiple invalid or inconclusive results. Our assay also demonstrated greater analytical sensitivity and more robust diagnostic performance than other recently reported CRISPR-based assays. Based on these findings, we believe that a CRISPR-based fluorescent application has potential to improve current COVID-19 screening efforts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; CRISPR; Fluorescent detection; Highly sensitive; Molecular diagnosis; SARS-CoV-2","Fluorescence; Real time systems; Diagnostic assays; Fluorescent probes; High-throughput operation; Limit of detection; Quantitative RT-PCR; Recent researches; Robust diagnostics; Sensitive detection; Polymerase chain reaction; fluorescent dye; virus RNA; virus RNA; amplicon; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; CRISPR Cas system; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; high throughput analysis; human; limit of detection; nose smear; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; genetic procedures; genetics; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; nucleic acid amplification; nucleotide sequence; pandemic; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; virology; virus gene; virus pneumonia; Base Sequence; Betacoronavirus; Biosensing Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Fluorescent Dyes; Genes, Viral; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32553350","Biosens.

There are no known treatment regimens with proven efficacy and vaccines thus far, posing an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs and vaccines for prevention and treatment. The urgency for its prevention and cure has resulted in an increased number of proposed treatment options. The high rate and volume of emerging clinical trials on therapies for COVID-19 need to be compared and evaluated to provide scientific evidence for effective medical options. Other emerging non-conventional drug discovery techniques such as bioinformatics and cheminformatics, structure-based drug design, network-based methods for prediction of drug-target interactions, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and phage technique could provide alternative routes to discovering potent Anti-SARS-CoV2 drugs.

Currently, a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses, known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which allegedly originally occurred in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly worldwide. The critically ill patients with ARDS have high mortality in subjects with comorbidities. Previously, the excessive recruitment and activation of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]), accompanied by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation were reported being implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. However, the direct visualization of lung epithelial injuries caused by NETs, and the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this damage are still lacking. Additionally, those already reported methods are limited for their neglect of the pathological role exerted by NETs and focusing only on the morphological features of NETosis. Therefore, we established a cell-based assay for detecting NETs during lung epithelial cells-neutrophils co-culture using the xCELLigence system, a recognized real-time, dynamic, label-free, sensitive, and high-throughput apparatus. Our results demonstrated that lung epithelial injuries, reflected by declines in cell index (CI) values, could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated PMNs, or NETs in a time and dose-dependent manner. NETs generation was verified to be the major contributor to the cytotoxicity of activated PMNs; protein components of NETs were the prevailing cytotoxic mediators. Moreover, this cell-based assay identified that PMNs from severe pneumonia patients had a high NETs formative potential. Additionally, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) were discovered alleviating NETs formation. Thus, this study not only presents a new methodology for detecting the pathophysiologic role of NETs but also lays down a foundation for exploring therapeutic interventions in an effort to cure ALI/ARDS in the clinical setting of severe pneumonia, including the emerging of NCIP. © 2020 The Authors","Acute lung injury; Lung epithelial cells; Neutrophil extracellular traps; Severe pneumonia; xCELLigence","acetylsalicylic acid; calcein; F actin; paracetamol; A-549 cell line; actin filament; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; confocal microscopy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytotoxicity; disease severity; DNA degradation; extracellular trap; flow cytometry; HBEC cell line (bronchial epithelium); high throughput analysis; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; leukocyte activation; live cell imaging; MLE-12 cell line; morphological trait; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Western blotting","32474064","Exp.

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins to enter human cells. Using gene expression datasets, Halwani and coworkers showed that the airways expression of these receptors is lower in children, but upregulated in smokers and COPD patients. This may contribute to the difference in disease severity observed among these patient categories. © 2020 The Authors","ACE2; bronchial; Children; COPD; COVID-19; hypertension; nasal epithelium; SARS-CoV-2; smoking; TMPRSS2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; serine proteinase; transmembrane serine protease 2; unclassified drug; adult; age; airway; Article; asthma; bronchus; bronchus epithelium; bronchus tissue; child; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; epithelium; essential hypertension; fibrosing alveolitis; gene expression level; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lung biopsy; lung parenchyma; lung sarcoidosis; nose; nose epithelium; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoking; systemic sclerosis; virus entry",,"Mol.

Such a perspective is significant not only for the control of virus diffusion but also represents a crucial point for the identification of produced alteration to the environmental quality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Drugs persistence; SARS-CoV-2; Wastewater","antivirus agent; aquatic environment; detection method; drug; methodology; persistence; virus; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diffusion; environmental impact; genetics; nonhuman; persistent virus infection; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; virology; virus detection; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus","32544725","Environ.

Patients were divided into a COVID-19 group (n = 141) and a control group (n = 234). Serum samples and throat swabs were collected from 375 patients for total antibody testing against SARS-COV-2 and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. The results indicated that diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95.7 % and 98.7 %, 92.2 % and 100 % by total antibody tests and RT-PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of total antibody tests combined with RT-PCR were 98.6 % and 98.7 %. The sensitivity of the combined method was significantly higher than RT-PCR (X2 = 5.16, P &lt; 0.05), and similar to that of total antibody tests (X2 = 1.15, P&gt; 0.05).

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research. © 2020 The Author(s)","Antiviral testing; Drug screening; In-cell ELISA; Neutralization; SARS-CoV-2","chloroquine; lopinavir; remdesivir; vitronectin; Article; cell culture; cell lysate; cell organelle; cell viability; Chlorocebus aethiops; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; plaque assay; priority journal; protein expression; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; tissue culture; Vero C1008 cell line; virus culture; virus detection; virus isolation; virus load; virus neutralization; virus titration","32738255","Antiviral Res.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089008881

Structures of the main proteases of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with and without inhibitor N3 are available in the Protein Data Bank. Comparing these structures revealed residue interaction network changes associated with N3 inhibition. Comparing network clustering with and without inhibitor N3 identified the formation of a cluster of residues 17, 18, 30–33, 70, 95, 98, 103, 117, 122, and 177 as a network change in both viral proteases when bound to inhibitor N3.

Consistently with evidence already available for other viruses, we initially hypothesized the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 presence on PM, and we performed a first experiment specifically aimed at confirming or excluding this research hyphotesys. Methods: We have collected 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period. Filters were properly stored and underwent RNA extraction and amplification according to WHO protocols in two parallel blind analyses performed by two different authorized laboratories. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (E, N, and RdRP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on particulate matter. Results: The first test showed positive results for gene E in 15 out of 16 samples, simultaneously displaying positivity also for RdRP gene in 4 samples. The second blind test got 5 additional positive results for at least one of the three marker genes. Overall, we tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 20 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers. Control tests to exclude false positivities were successfully accomplished. Conclusion: This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on PM, thus suggesting a possible use as indicator of epidemic recurrence. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; COVID-19; Particulate matter; SARS-CoV-2","virus RNA; epidemic; experimental study; gene expression; particulate matter; public health; RNA; virus; air sampling; airborne virus; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; humidity; Italy; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; RNA extraction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; World Health Organization; Bergamo; Italy; Lombardy; SARS coronavirus","32526492","Environ.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate other strategies able to overcome the limits of RT‑qPCR. Blinded swab samples from two individuals diagnosed positive and negative for COVID‑19 were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT‑qPCR in order to assess the sensitivity of both methods. Intercalation chemistries and a World Health Organization (WHO)/Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)‑approved probe for the SARS‑CoV‑2 N gene were used. SYBR‑Green RT‑qPCR is not able to diagnose as positive samples with low viral load, while, TaqMan Probe RT‑qPCR gave positive signals at very late Ct values. On the contrary, ddPCR showed higher sensitivity rate compared to RT‑qPCR and both EvaGreen and probe ddPCR were able to recognize the sample with low viral load as positive even at 10‑fold diluted concentration. In conclusion, ddPCR shows higher sensitivity and specificity compared to RT‑qPCR for the diagnosis of COVID‑19 infection in false‑negative samples with low viral load.

The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible.

Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is characterized by “inflamm-aging”. It is highly likely that “inflamm-aging” is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic search in the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar pre-print database using all available MeSH terms for COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, senescent cell, cytokine storm, inflame-aging, ACE2 receptor, autophagy, and Vitamin D.

Results: The aim of the present review was to summarize experimental data and clinical observations that linked the pathophysiology mechanisms of “inflamm-aging”, mild-grade inflammation, and cytokine storm in some elderly adults with severe COVID-19 infection. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ACE2 receptor; Autophagy; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Senescent cell; Vitamin D","angiotensin 2 receptor; angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; cytokine; reactive oxygen metabolite; vitamin D; adipocyte; age; aged; aging; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; cell aging; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; cytology; human; immune system; immunology; inflammation; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; virology; virus pneumonia; vitamin D deficiency; Adipocytes; Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Cellular Senescence; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Humans; Immune System; Inflammation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reactive Oxygen Species; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency","32529477","Inflamm.

However, lacking is a temperance in enthusiasm for their possible use as well as sufficient perspective on their effects and side-effects. CQ and HCQ have well-known properties of being diprotic weak bases that preferentially accumulate in acidic organelles (endolysosomes and Golgi apparatus) and neutralize luminal pH of acidic organelles. These primary actions of CQ and HCQ are responsible for their anti-malarial effects; malaria parasites rely on acidic digestive vacuoles for survival. Similarly, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi by CQ and HCQ may block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) integration into host cells because SARS-CoV-2 may require an acidic environment for its entry and for its ability to bud and infect bystander cells. Further, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi may underly the immunosuppressive effects of these two drugs. However, modern cell biology studies have shown clearly that de-acidification results in profound changes in the structure, function and cellular positioning of endolysosomes and Golgi, in signaling between these organelles and other subcellular organelles, and in fundamental cellular functions. Thus, studying the possible therapeutic effects of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 must occur concurrent with studies of the extent to which these drugs affect organellar and cell biology.

Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010–2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility. Chronic exposure to air pollutants might have a role in the spread of Covid-19 in Italian regions.

This tight monitoring of the invasion of a new virus is a situation that most other invasion scientists could only dream of. Especially spatiotemporal spread data of the early phases of an invasion would be extremely useful in order to understand and predict the human-mediated spread of species around the globe. So far, invasive species that directly affect human health, such as the Sars-Cov-2 virus causing COVID-19, have been treated differently from invasive species affecting environmental health. Despite progresses in constructing large checklists of invasive species, these records often enter the databases only decades after the establishment of the organism in a country. This is inadequate to understand ongoing spread dynamics and estimate current invasion risks. Yet, national services often possess extremely useful information about early detections and interceptions of species at air and maritime ports, which could greatly improve predictions and help set management priorities. Considering the massive impacts of invasive species, it is time to move on to such a collaborative way of handling invasion data.

The symptoms vary from person to person and many are “hidden carriers.” Few people experience immediate reaction and even death within 48 h of infection. However, many show mild to chronic symptoms and recover. Nevertheless, the death rate due to COVID-19 transmission is high especially among patients with non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to consider vitamins as epigenetic modifiers to enhance immunity and reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients with non-communicable diseases. Recent Findings: Clinical evidence has suggested the risk of getting infected is high among individuals with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal disease, as well as the elderly with high mortality rate among the cohort. The impact is due to an already compromised immune system of patients. Every patient has a different response to COVID-19, which shows that the ability to combat the deadly virus varies individually. Thus, treatment can be personalized and adjusted to help protect and combat COVID-19 infections, especially in individuals with non-communicable diseases. Summary: Based on current published scientific and medical evidence, the suggestions made in this article for combination of vitamin therapy as epigenetic modifiers to control the unregulated inflammatory and cytokine marker expressions, further needs to be clinically proven. Future research and clinical trials can apply the suggestions given in this article to support metabolic activities in patients and enhance the immune response. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Immunotherapy; Non-communicable disease; Pandemic; Vitamin",,"32661859","Curr.

The neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of CoVs-induced CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. We consider that a widespread awareness of the significant neurotropism of CoVs might contribute to an earlier recognition of the signs and symptoms of viral-induced CNS damage. Moreover, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CoVs affect CNS function and cause CNS damage could help in planning new strategies for prognostic evaluation and targeted therapeutic intervention. © 2020","Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Neuroinflammation; SARS; Viral encephalitis","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; CXCL9 chemokine; emapalumab; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; sarilumab; serine proteinase; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; ageusia; anosmia; central nervous system disease; central nervous system function; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; headache; health care planning; heart failure; human; immune response; ischemia; kidney failure; lung insufficiency; molecular mechanics; mortality rate; nausea; neurobiology; neurotropism; nonhuman; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; prognosis; respiratory failure; Review; sensory dysfunction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus entry; virus virulence; vomiting; animal; Betacoronavirus; brain; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pathophysiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32622086","Neurobiol.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS–MS) operated in selected-reaction monitoring (SRM) mode is the method of choice in quantitative bioanalysis of drugs, e.g., to establish bioavailability, to study pharmacokinetics, and later on possibly for therapeutic drug monitoring. In this study, the fragmentation in MS–MS of small-molecule antiviral drugs against herpes and influenza viruses is reviewed. In this way, insight is gained on the identity of the product ions used in SRM. Fragmentation schemes of antiviral agents are also relevant in the identification of drug metabolites or (forced) degradation products. As information of the fragmentation of antiviral drugs in MS–MS and the identity of the product ions is very much scattered in the scientific literature, it was decided to collect this information and to review it. In this third study, attention is paid to small-molecule antiviral agents used against herpes and influenza virus infections. In addition, some attention is paid to broad-spectrum antiviral agents, that are investigated with respect to their efficacy in challenging virus infections of this century, e.g., involving Ebola, Zika and corona viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, which is causing a world-wide pandemic at this very moment.

The importance of water as a parameter affecting virion stability and inactivation has been recognized across disciplinary areas. The large number of virus species, differences in spreading, likelihood of foodborne infections, unknown infective doses, and difficulties of infective virus quantification are often limiting experimental approaches to establish accurate data required for detailed understanding of virions’ stability and inactivation kinetics in various foods. Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions’ resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment. Novel food processing, particularly high pressure processing (HPP) and cold plasma technologies, seem to provide efficient means for virion inactivation and food quality retention prior to packaging or food preservation by traditional technologies. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Food preservation; Food processing; Foodborne viruses; Virus inactivation; Water","Activation energy; Biological materials; Digital storage; Diseases; Food microbiology; Food preservation; Food storage; Knowledge based systems; Processed foods; Stability; Temperature distribution; Thermal processing (foods); Experimental approaches; Foodborne infections; High pressure processing; Inactivation kinetics; Protein denaturation; Sensitive components; Temperature dependence; Virus inactivation; Viruses",,"Food.

However, its active compounds and mechanisms of action are still unknown. Firstly, we divided QFPD into five functional units (FUs) according to the compatibility theory of traditional Chinese medicine. The corresponding common targets of the five FUs were all significantly enriched in Go Ontology (oxidoreductase activity, lipid metabolic process, homeostatic process, etc.), KEGG pathways (steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, etc.), TTD diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary Disease, etc.), miRNA (MIR183), kinase (CDK7) and TF (LXR). QFPD contained 257 specific targets in addition to HCoV, pneumonia and ACE2 co-expression proteins. Then, network topology analysis of the five components-target-pathway-disease networks yielded 67 active ingredients. In addition, ADMET estimations showed that 20 compounds passed the stringent lead-like criteria and in silico drug-likeness test with high gastrointestinal absorption and the median lethal dose (LD50 > 1600 mg/kg). Moreover, 4 specific ingredients (M3, S1, X2 and O2) and 5 common ingredients (MS1, MX16, SX1, WO1 and XO1) of QFPD presented good molecular docking score for 2019-nCov structure and non-structure proteins. Finally, drug perturbation of COVID-19 network robustness showed that all five FUs may protect COVID-19 independently, and target 8 specifically expressed drug-attacked nodes which were related to the bacterial and viral responses, immune system, signaling transduction, etc. In conclusion, our new FUNP analysis showed that QFPD had a protection effect on COVID-19 by regulating a complex molecular network with safety and efficacy.

To examine the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, we investigate the spread of this pandemic using Malaysia as a case study and scrutinise its interactions with some exogenous factors such as limited medical resources and false detection problems. To do this, we employ a simple epidemiological model and analyse this system using modelling and dynamical systems techniques. We discover some contrasting findings with respect to the observations of basic reproduction number: while it is observed that R0 seems to provide a good description of transmission dynamics in simple outbreak scenarios, this quantity might mislead the assessment on the severity of pandemic when certain complexities such as limited medical resources and false detection problems are incorporated into the model. In particular, we observe the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak through bistable behaviour, even when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Based on these findings, we caution policy makers not to make their decisions solely based on the guidance of the basic reproduction number only, which clearly could cause trouble. © 2020","Alternative stable states; Bifurcation; False detection; Limited medical resources; SIRS epidemic model","Cell proliferation; Diseases; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Transmissions; Basic reproduction number; Bistables; Epidemiological modeling; Exogenous factors; False detection problems; Policy makers; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Transmission dynamics; Medical problems",,"Chaos Solitons Fractals",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085921026

Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing.

The globe suffer from lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers are doing their best to discover the nature of this pandemic and try to produce the possible plans to control it. One of the most effective method to understand and control the evolution of this pandemic is to model it via an efficient mathematical model. In this paper, we propose to model COVID-19 pandemic by fractional order SIDARTHE model which did not appear in the literature before. The existence of a stable solution of the fractional order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model is proved and the fractional order necessary conditions of four proposed control strategies are produced. The sensitivity of the fractional order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model to the fractional order and the infection rate parameters are displayed.

This study calculates the relative risk of the importation and exportation of the COVID-19 virus. The study's most important contribution is the calculation of the overall relative risk of the importation and exportation of COVID-19 from every airport in local municipalities around the world, based on global spatial and mapping information. Three scenarios of air travel restriction are considered, and the change in the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 is calculated. The relative risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 clearly shows that not only China, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, but also the U.S., Australia, and countries in northeast Asia and Latin America are subject to risk. Further, a larger reduction in air travel through airports in a large part of the cumulative incidence area would lead to a gradual decrease in the risk flow. Importantly, the exportation risk of the disease from some airports in China, Iran, and European countries has a higher global spread than the importation risk during the pandemic stage. Therefore, every airport, or government with airports in their jurisdiction, should implement strict countermeasures. It is also indispensable for these countries to undertake countermeasures for COVID-19, such as home quarantine within each country and restricting infected or suspected individuals from flying on airplanes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Exportation risk; Importation risk; Pandemic countermeasures","air transportation; airport; COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; risk assessment; viral disease; Coronavirus",,"Transp.

While preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency, clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of COVID-19 infection. However, available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in term of dosing optimization. In this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing PK and PK-PD studies in this era of COVID. A special attention should be paid to pre-analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose-exposure relationships (co-medications, use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para-clinical data). We also promote the development of population PK and PK-PD models specifically dedicated to COVID-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases (SEL, malaria, HIV) and clinical situations (steady-state, non-ICU patients) are not representative of severe patients. Therefore, implementation of well-designed PK and PD studies targeted to COVID-19 patients is urgently needed.

The spreading and infection factors of this disease are very high. A huge number of people from most of the countries are infected within six months from its first report of appearance and it keeps spreading. The required systems are not ready up to some stages for any pandemic; therefore, mitigation with existing capacity becomes necessary. On the other hand, modern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data Science; and Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques. It could use to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, patient care, and many more. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. A shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. So, Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could work on another task. In addition, Edge Devices(ED) such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are very useful in a pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreak. But these are equipped with low computing resources, so, applying DL is also a bit challenging; therefore, DTL also would be effective there.

We have compared the results, using hypothetical data, between the current scenario and proposed strategies. The result shows that sharing information and resources from all manufacturers to produce under a single brand, emergency sourcing, producing basic quality items, and packing in the smallest sizes have a significant positive impact on the service level.

The disease has become pandemic, affecting almost all nations of the world, and has caused enormous economic, social and psychological burden on countries. Hygiene and educational campaign programmes have been identified to be potent public health interventions that can curtail the spread of the highly infectious disease. In order to verify this claim quantitatively, we propose and analyze a non-linear mathematical model to investigate the effect of healthy sanitation and awareness on the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prevalence. Rigorous stability analysis of the model equilibrium points was performed to ascertain the basic reproduction number R0, a threshold that determines whether or not a disease dies out of the population. Our model assumes that education on the disease transmission and prevention induce behavioral changes in individuals to imbibe good hygiene, thereby reducing the basic reproduction number and disease burden.

We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak IP can be achieved only at the price of increasing the time tP of its occurrence and its entire time-span tE. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate β by a factor of λ. We show that for a given value of the size (IP, the total, IE and average I^P number of infected), its occurrence time tP and entire time-span tE can be reduced by a factor 1/λ if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time tP and the entire time span tE could have been reduced by a factor 0.9 ≤ 1/λ ≤ 0.34 with containment measures focused on increasing β instead of reducing α. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Dynamic models; Dynamics; Epidemic dynamics; Infection rates; Northern Italy; Removal rate; Reparametrization; Scaling behaviours; Time domain; Time-scales; Disease control",,"Chaos Solitons Fractals",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085766467

Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic. Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection & inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment & vaccination response. Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity & mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis & osteoarthritis patients alike.

Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public. © 2020 The Author(s)",,"Drops; Shipbuilding; Air re-circulation; Airborne transmission; Building engineering; Contaminated surfaces; Engineering controls; Healthcare workers; Particle filtration; Relative contribution; Transmissions; air conditioning; airborne transmission; airborne virus; ambient air; cleaning; coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; epidemic; hand washing; human; infection control; isolation; Letter; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus transmission; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; crowding (area); devices; exposure; filtration; microbiology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Crowding; Disinfection; Filtration; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Ventilation","32521345","Environ.

Contrary to previous assumptions that GBCAs are stable throughout the water cycle, they can degrade. The stability of GBCAs depends largely on their organic ligands, but also on the physicochemical conditions. There is specific concern regarding UV end-of-pipe water treatments, which may degrade GBCAs. Degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects. This is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater. GBCAs concentrations in aquatic systems, often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium, are determined using a variety of calculation methods. Where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low, the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty. The current COVID-19 crisis will, in the short-term, drastically decrease the input of GBCAs to freshwater systems. Temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river-aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities.

Despite tremendous challenges, community-wide efforts have led to a variety of novel approaches for predicting drug polypharmacology. In particular, some rapid advances using machine learning and artificial intelligence have been reported with great success. Areas covered: In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive update on the current state-of-the-art polypharmacology approaches and their applications, focusing on those reports published after our 2017 review article. The authors particularly discuss some novel, groundbreaking concepts, and methods that have been developed recently and applied to drug polypharmacology studies. Expert opinion: Polypharmacology is evolving and novel concepts are being introduced to counter the current challenges in the field. However, major hurdles remain including incompleteness of high-quality experimental data, lack of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize multi-targeting agents, shortage of robust computational methods, and challenges to identify the best target combinations and design effective multi-targeting agents. Fortunately, numerous national/international efforts including multi-omics and artificial intelligence initiatives as well as most recent collaborations on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic have shown significant promise to propel the field of polypharmacology forward. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial Intelligence; deep Learning; Drug Polypharmacology; drug Repurposing; molecular Promiscuity; multi-omics; multi-targeting Design; network Pharmacology; off-targets",,"32452701","Expert Opin.

The current study provides evidence on the ameliorative impact of nifuroxazide, and FDA approved antidiarrheal drug in attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and myocarditis when administrated either in prophylactic or curative regimens. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in lung and heart histopathological characteristics and architecture with retraction of LPS-induced inflammatory-infiltration. This was associated with retraction in serum biomarkers of cellular injury of which; LDH, CK-MB, and ALP. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in both lung and heart oxidative status. Such positive outcomes were underlined by a significant inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on lung and heart contents of toll-like receptor (4) (TLR4)/the inflammasome NALPR3/interleukin- 1β (IL-1β). In conclusion: Nifuroxazide attenuates LPS-induced ALI and myocardial injury via interruption of TLR4/NALPR3/IL-1β signaling.

Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM10 concentration was 189 to 278 μg/m3 in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 μg/m3 after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3–5 °C, noise level is dropped to &lt;65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period. Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to the river. For instance, total dissolve solid (TDS) level in river water adjacent to crushing unit is attenuated by almost two times.

Implementing fast and widespread diagnostic tests is paramount to contain COVID-19, given the current lack of an effective therapeutic or vaccine. This review focuses on a broad description of currently available diagnostic tests to detect either the virus (SARS-CoV-2) or virus-induced immune responses. We specifically explain the working mechanisms of these tests and compare their analytical performance. These analyses will assist in selecting most effective tests for a given application, for example, epidemiology or global pandemic research, population screening, hospital-based testing, home-based and point-of-care testing, and therapeutic trials.

The baculovirus vector-derived S proteins were successfully secreted to silkworm serum, whereas those formed insoluble structure in the larval fat body and the pupal cells. The ectodomain of S protein with the native sequence was cleaved by the host furin-protease, resulting in less recombinant protein production. The S protein modified in furin protease-target site was efficiently secreted to silkworm serum and was purified as oligomers, which showed immunoreactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S2 antibody. By using the direct transfection of recombinant bacmid to silkworms, we achieved the efficient production of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free system.

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Concentration protocol; Coronavirus; Environmental surveillance; Influent water; Reclaimed water; RNA virus","Aluminum hydroxide; Diagnosis; Diseases; Magnesium alloys; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Average recovery; Concentration method; Environmental surveillance; Iberian Peninsula; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Tertiary effluent; Untreated wastewater; Effluents; aluminum hydroxide; virus RNA; RNA; disease prevalence; RNA; severe acute respiratory syndrome; urban area; virus; adsorption; Article; city; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; effluent; human; Mengo virus; monitoring; nonhuman; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; precipitation; prevalence; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Spain; waste water; waste water treatment plant; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; pig; prevalence; SARS coronavirus; virus pneumonia; waste water; Iberian Peninsula; Murcia [Spain]; Spain; Coronavirus; Mengo virus; Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; RNA viruses; SARS coronavirus; Sus; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; RNA; SARS Virus; Spain; Swine; Waste Water","32425251","Water Res.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084824306

We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; Global health; Modeling; Wastewater-based epidemiology","Computational methods; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Population statistics; Travel time; Computational analysis; Global economics; Local conditions; Medical screening; Orders of magnitude; Population sizes; Specific location; Two-step process; Monitoring; COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious disease; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; temperature effect; wastewater; Article; clinical evaluation; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; disease surveillance; feasibility study; geographic distribution; global health; human; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; pandemic; population size; priority journal; resource management; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; waste water; wastewater based epidemiology; water temperature; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; Louisiana; New York; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Detroit; Hubei; Iran; Italy; Lombardy; Louisiana; Madrid [Spain]; Michigan; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; New Orleans; New York [United States]; Seattle; Spain; Tehran [Iran]; United States; Washington [United States]; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Feasibility Studies; Humans; New Orleans; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring","32371231","Sci.

The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called as Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP).

First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions.

It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Molecular detection based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, high false negative rates were reported. We describe here the development of a point-of-care (POC) serological assay for the detection of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The principle of a lateral flow immunoassay strip (LFIAs) consists of fixing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to the surface of the strip and coupling anti-human IgG with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A series of parameters of this method were optimized, including the concentration of coating antigen, BSA blocking concentration and pH value for conjugation. The entire detection process took 15-20 min with a volume of 80 μL of the analyte solution containing 10 μL of serum and 70 μL sample diluent. The performance of the established assay was evaluated using serum samples of the clinically diagnosed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results indicated that the LFIAs for SARS-CoV-2 had satisfactory stability and reproducibility. As a result, our fast and easy LFIAs could provide a preliminary test result for physicians to make the correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections along with alternative testing methods and clinical findings, as well as seroprevalence determination, especially in low-resource countries.",,"gold; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; metal nanoparticle; nucleocapsid protein; nucleocapsid protein, Coronavirus; virus antibody; Betacoronavirus; blood; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; human; immunoassay; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; pandemic; point of care system; procedures; reproducibility; virology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Gold; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Metal Nanoparticles; Nucleocapsid Proteins; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Point-of-Care Systems; Reproducibility of Results","32568341","Analyst",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088880368

Here, we designed and evaluated two single-tube nested (STN) real-time RT-PCR assays, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/Hel and N genes. Both STN assays had a low limit of detection and did not cross react with other human coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Using 213 initial respiratory specimens from suspected COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity of both the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and the STN COVID-19-N assays was 100% (99/99), while that of the comparator non-nested N assay was 95% (94/99). Among 108 follow-up specimens from confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested negative by the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, 28 (25.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel or the STN COVID-19-N assay. To evaluate the performance of our novel STN assays in pooled specimens, we created four sample pools, with each pool consisting of one low positive specimen and 49 negative specimens. While the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive in only one of four sample pools (25%), both of the STN assays were positive in two of four samples pools (50%). In conclusion, the STN assays are highly sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Their boosted sensitivity offers advantages in non-traditional COVID-19 testing algorithms such as saliva screening and pooled sample screening during massive screening.","COVID-19; evaluation; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; single-tube nested",,"32784770","Int J Mol Sci",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089407723

We evaluated the in vitro pharmacology of baricitinib across relevant leukocyte subpopulations coupled to its in vivo pharmacokinetics and showed it inhibited signaling of cytokines implicated in COVID-19 infection. We validated the AI-predicted biochemical inhibitory effects of baricitinib on human numb-associated kinase (hNAK) members measuring nanomolar affinities for AAK1, BIKE, and GAK. Inhibition of NAKs led to reduced viral infectivity with baricitinib using human primary liver spheroids. These effects occurred at exposure levels seen clinically. In a case series of patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, inflammatory markers, and IL-6 levels.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells from 8 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. We identified antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2; this activity correlates with competition with ACE2 for binding to RBD. Unexpectedly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the infected plasma did not cross-react with the RBDs of SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), although there was substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric spike proteins. Analysis of the crystal structure of RBD-bound antibody revealed that steric hindrance inhibits viral engagement with ACE2, thereby blocking viral entry.

COVID-19 cases are confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in biological samples by RT-qPCR. However, limited numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available when the first RT-qPCR methods were developed in January 2020 for initial in silico specificity evaluation and to verify whether the targeted loci are highly conserved. Now that more whole genome data have become available, we used the bioinformatics tool SCREENED and a total of 4755 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, downloaded at two different time points, to evaluate the specificity of 12 RT-qPCR tests (consisting of a total of 30 primers and probe sets) used for SARS-CoV-2 detection and the impact of the virus' genetic evolution on four of them. The exclusivity of these methods was also assessed using the human reference genome and 2624 closely related other respiratory viral genomes. The specificity of the assays was generally good and stable over time. An exception is the first method developed by the China Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), which exhibits three primer mismatches present in 358 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced mainly in Europe from February 2020 onwards. The best results were obtained for the assay of Chan et al. (2020) targeting the gene coding for the spiking protein (S). This demonstrates that our user-friendly strategy can be used for a first in silico specificity evaluation of future RT-qPCR tests, as well as verifying that the former methods are still capable of detecting circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.","bioinformatics tool; COVID-19; detection; diagnosis; in silico specificity evaluation; mismatches; primers and probes; RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; WGS data","RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetic database; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; open reading frame; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; single nucleotide polymorphism; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; whole genome sequencing; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Genetic; Genome, Viral; Humans; Open Reading Frames; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Replicase; RNA, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity; Whole Genome Sequencing","32759818","Int J Mol Sci",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089170700

The quantification and localization analysis of the transcripts of a particular gene allows disease states to be characterized more directly compared to an analysis on the transcriptome wide level. This is particularly needed for the early detection of virus infections as now required for emergent viral diseases, e. g. Covid-19. In situ mRNA analysis, however, is a formidable challenge and currently performed with sets of single-fluorophore-containing oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to the mRNA in question. Often a large number of probe strands (>30) are required to get a reliable signal. The more oligonucleotide probes are used, however, the higher the potential off-target binding effects that create background noise. Here, we used click chemistry and alkyne-modified DNA oligonucleotides to prepare multiple-fluorophore-containing probes. We found that these multiple-dye probes allow reliable detection and direct visualization of mRNA with only a very small number (5–10) of probe strands. The new method enabled the in situ detection of viral transcripts as early as 4 hours after infection. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to increase ACE2 expression in animal models, and worse outcomes are reported in patients with co-morbidities commonly treated with these agents, leading to controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic over whether these drugs might be helpful or harmful. Methods:: Animal, in vitro and clinical data relevant to the biology of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its interaction with the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and SARS-CoV-2, and clinical studies were reviewed. Findings and Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2to invade and damage cells, downregulating ACE2, reducing its protective effects and exacerbating injurious Ang II effects. However, retrospective observational studies do not show higher risk of infection with ACEI or ARB use. Nevertheless, study of the RAS and KKS in the setting of coronaviral infection may yield therapeutic targets. © 2020 The Author(s)","ACE inhibitors; ACE2; ARBs; COVID-19; Kallikrein-kinin system; Renin-angiotensin system; SARS-CoV-2",,,"EBioMedicine",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089100166

This innovative data source can improve the precision of epidemiological modeling to understand the penetrance of SARS-CoV-2 in specific vulnerable communities. Here, we tested wastewater collected at a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts and detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the N gene at significant titers (57 to 303 copies per ml of sewage) in the period from 18 to 25 March 2020 using RT-qPCR. We validated detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Sanger sequencing the PCR product from the S gene. Viral titers observed were significantly higher than expected based on clinically confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of 25 March. Our approach is scalable and may be useful in modeling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks. IMPORTANCE Wastewater-based surveillance is a promising approach for proactive outbreak monitoring. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in stool early in the clinical course and infects a large asymptomatic population, making it an ideal target for wastewater-based monitoring. In this study, we develop a laboratory protocol to quantify viral titers in raw sewage via qPCR analysis and validate results with sequencing analysis. Our results suggest that the number of positive cases estimated from wastewater viral titers is orders of magnitude greater than the number of confirmed clinical cases and therefore may significantly impact efforts to understand the case fatality rate and progression of disease. These data may help inform decisions surrounding the advancement or scale-back of social distancing and quarantine efforts based on dynamic wastewater catchment-level estimations of prevalence. © 2020 Wu et al.

We determined cryo-EM structures for RaTG13 S and for both furin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; we compared these with recently reported structures for uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S. We also biochemically characterized their relative stabilities and affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Although the overall structures of human and bat virus S proteins are similar, there are key differences in their properties, including a more stable precleavage form of human S and about 1,000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor. These observations suggest that cleavage at the furin-cleavage site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S and facilitates the adoption of the open conformation that is required for S to bind to the ACE2 receptor. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"coronavirus spike glycoprotein; furin; glycoprotein ratg 13; unclassified drug; vitronectin; Article; bat; biochemical analysis; comparative study; molecular evolution; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein structure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","32647346","Nat.

In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5–4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5–2.3%, 95% CI), respectively. More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic locations, as well as to determine at what rate seroprevalence is increasing with the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.

First published June 9, 2020; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00187.2020.—The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is posing a global health emergency and has led to more than 380,000 deaths worldwide. The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiviral, prosurvival, and antiaging effects. In light of the research advances on H2S signaling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defense against COVID-19. It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development. Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19. © 2020 the American Physiological Society","ACE2; COVID-19; H2S; SARS-CoV-2; TMPRSS2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydrogen sulfide; serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein, human; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; host pathogen interaction; human; lung; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Lung; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Serine Endopeptidases; Signal Transduction; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication","32515982","Am.

Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities.

The food supply chain and the food industry do not comprise an exception. Scope and approach: This review summarizes the possible transmission ways of COVID-19 through the foods, food supply chain, surfaces, and environment before exploring the development of corresponding detection tools of SARS-CoV-2. For the time being, the possibility of transmission through the food sector is considered negligible, and tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in working environments is not considered as a priority by public authorities. However, the adverse effects on the environment, food systems, and people along the food supply chain are already evident. Key findings and conclusions: As long as we move from farm to fork, more safety measures are needed since more people (and subsequently more potential sources of infection) are involved in the process. The need for developing respective bioanalytical protocols for food and environmental safety applications to adapt in the post-lockdown period is also highlighted. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","After lockdown; Food safety; SARS-CoV-2; Supply chain; Swab tests; Virus detection",,,"Trends Food Sci.

At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-inflammatory; Antiviral; Liu Shen capsule; SARS-CoV-2","Chinese drug; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; liu shen; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; remdesivir; transcription factor RelA; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; adenosine phosphate; alanine; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; autacoid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Liu-Shen-Wan; remdesivir; animal cell; antiinflammatory activity; antiviral activity; Article; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytopathogenic effect; drug capsule; Huh-7 cell line; human; human cell; immunoregulation; in vitro study; MAPK signaling; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; transmission electron microscopy; Vero C1008 cell line; virion; virus inhibition; virus particle; virus replication; Western blotting; animal; Betacoronavirus; cell culture; cell proliferation; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug mixture; metabolism; pandemic; pharmacology; virology; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chlorocebus aethiops; Complex Mixtures; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; NF-kappa B; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Virion","32360580","Pharmacol.

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT–PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT–PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT–PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT–PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,"32427924","Nat.

Methods: Pooled plasma samples from PCR positive COVID-19 patients were used to identify linear B-cell epitopes from a SARS-CoV-2 peptide library of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins by peptide-based ELISA. Hit epitopes were further validated with 79 COVID-19 patients with different disease severity status, 13 seasonal human CoV, 20 recovered SARS patients and 22 healthy donors. Findings: Four immunodominant epitopes, S14P5, S20P2, S21P2 and N4P5, were identified on the S and N viral proteins. IgG responses to all identified epitopes displayed a strong detection profile, with N4P5 achieving the highest level of specificity (100%) and sensitivity (>96%) against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the magnitude of IgG responses to S14P5, S21P2 and N4P5 were strongly associated with disease severity. Interpretation: IgG responses to the peptide epitopes can serve as useful indicators for the degree of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients, and function as higly specific and sensitive sero-immunosurveillance tools for recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infections. The flexibility of these epitopes to be used alone or in combination will allow for the development of improved point-of-care-tests (POCTs).

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. The virus and host factors interplay among distinct outcomes of infected patients. Methods: Using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) in PubMed, authors searched for articles cotaining information on COVID-19 and the skin. Results: The pathophysiology of the disease is multifactorial: association with innate immune response, hypercoagulability state, lung tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, monocytic/macrophage activation syndrome, culminating in exaggerated cytokine secretion, called “cytokine storm”, which leads to worsening and death. These systemic conditions may be associated with cutaneous lesions, that have polymorphic aspects, where at histopathological level show involvement in different skin changes. These lesions may be associated with multisystemic manifestations that could occur due to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease action, allowing the pulmonary infection and possibly skin manifestation. Several reports in literature show cutaneous lesions similar to chilblain, urticarial eruptions, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicle trunk, purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE) and others. Conclusions: This review describes the complexity of Covid-19, pathophysiological and clinical aspects, dermatological finding and other dermatological conditions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","COVID-19; Innate immunity; Lipoprotein A; Livedoid vasculitis; Macrophage; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; serine proteinase; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; artery occlusion; chilblain; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; erythema; human; hypercoagulability; innate immunity; lung infection; lung parenchyma; macrophage activation syndrome; nonhuman; pathophysiology; purpura; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; skin defect; skin manifestation; systematic review; arteriole; Betacoronavirus; capillary; complication; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; endothelium; immune system; lung; metabolism; pandemic; pathology; pathophysiology; skin disease; treatment outcome; virology; virus pneumonia; Arterioles; Betacoronavirus; Capillaries; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Endothelium; Humans; Immune System; Lung; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Skin Diseases; Treatment Outcome","32488318","Inflamm.

In this study, we provide a coherent overview of the duration of viral detection and viral RNA load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity, and age. Method: We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1.11.2019 and 23.04.2020. We pooled the data of selected studies (22/7226 (650 patients) for meta-analysis) to estimate duration of viral detection and visualized viral load over time. Findings: Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT in adult patients (5•7 days in mild; 5•9 days in moderate-severe patients). The differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection for moderate-severe patients was observed in feces (15 days in mild vs. 21 days in moderate-severe patients) and the URT (12 days in mild vs. 16 days in moderate-severe patients). Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in earlier stages of infection in the URT compared to LRT. Interpretation: This review may aid mathematical modelling and help in defining appropriate endpoints for clinical trails with antivirals in COVID-19.

Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of IL-6. There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still’s disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity. Herein, we analyse the pathogenic role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion therapy as a novel therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adult-onset Still’s disease; Anti-viral; Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome; COVID-19; Deferoxamine; Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; Hyperferritinemic; Iron; Iron; Iron depletion therapy; Macrophage activation syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","adalimumab; alemtuzumab; anakinra; antibiotic agent; canakinumab; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; deferasirox; deferiprone; deferoxamine; eculizumab; emapalumab; etanercept; etoposide; ferritin; glucocorticoid; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; hypertensive factor; immunoglobulin; infliximab; interleukin 6; iron; methotrexate; rilonacept; rituximab; ruxolitinib; tocilizumab; unindexed drug; ferritin; iron; iron chelating agent; adult onset Still disease; antifibrotic activity; antiphospholipid syndrome; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; disease severity; fibrosis; fluid resuscitation; hemophagocytic syndrome; human; hyperferritinemia; immunomodulation; inflammation; iron blood level; iron chelation; iron depletion; lung disease; lymphocytopenia; macrophage activation syndrome; mortality; neutrophilia; nonhuman; pathogenesis; plasmapheresis; priority journal; redox stress; Review; septic shock; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; iron overload; metabolism; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ferritins; Humans; Iron; Iron Chelating Agents; Iron Overload; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32681497","Immunol.

Here, we discuss the critical role T cells play in the orchestration of the antiviral response underlying the pathogenesis of the disease, COVID-19. We highlight the scientific rationale for comprehensive and longitudinal TCR analyses in COVID-19 and reason that analyzing TCR repertoire in COVID-19 patients would reveal important findings that may explain the outcome disparity observed in these patients.

In this commentary, we identify challenges and opportunities at human–primate interfaces in light of COVID-19, focusing on examples from Asia, and make recommendations for researchers working with wild primates to reduce zoonosis risk and leverage research opportunities. First, we briefly review the evidence for zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss risks of zoonosis at the human–primate interface. We then identify challenges that the pandemic has caused for primates, including reduced nutrition, increased intraspecific competition, and increased poaching risk, as well as challenges facing primatologists, including lost research opportunities. Subsequently, we highlight opportunities arising from pandemic-related lockdowns and public health messaging, including opportunities to reduce the intensity of problematic human–primate interfaces, opportunities to reduce the risk of zoonosis between humans and primates, opportunities to reduce legal and illegal trade in primates, new opportunities for research on human–primate interfaces, and opportunities for community education. Finally, we recommend specific actions that primatologists should take to reduce contact and aggression between humans and primates, to reduce demand for primates as pets, to reduce risks of zoonosis in the context of field research, and to improve understanding of human–primate interfaces. Reducing the risk of zoonosis and promoting the well-being of humans and primates at our interfaces will require substantial changes from “business as usual.” We encourage primatologists to help lead the way. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","biosafety; ethics; human–primate conflict; provisioning; SARS-CoV-2; zoonosis","Primates; SARS coronavirus; animal; Coronavirus infection; environmental protection; feeding behavior; human; pandemic; physiology; primate; primate disease; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coronavirus Infections; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Primate Diseases; Primates; Risk Factors; Zoonoses","32686188","Am.

Later on, in 2012, the Middle‐East respiratory syndrome spread in Saudi Arabia, caused by MERS‐CoV. Currently, the global crisis is caused by the pandemic SARS‐ CoV‐2, which belongs to the same lineage of SARS‐CoV. In response to the urgent need of diagnostic tools, several lab‐based and biosensing techniques have been proposed so far. Five main areas have been individuated and discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The cell‐culture detection and the microneutralization tests are still considered highly reliable methods. The genetic screening, featuring the well‐established Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), represents the gold standard for virus detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. On the other side, immunoassays were developed, either by screening/antigen recognition of IgM/IgG or by detecting the whole virus, in blood and sera. Next, proteomic mass‐spectrometry (MS)‐based methodologies have also been proposed for the analysis of swab samples. Finally, virus-biosensing devices were efficiently designed. Both electrochemical immunosensors and eye‐based technologies have been described, showing detection times lower than 10 min after swab introduction. Alternative to swab‐based techniques, lateral flow point‐of‐care immunoassays are already commercially available for the analysis of blood samples. Such biosensing devices hold the advantage of being portable for on‐site testing in hospitals, airports, and hotspots, virtually without any sample treatment or complicated lab precautions. © 2020 by the authors.

We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT–PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People’s Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15–26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6–10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8–38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Data on patients with re-detectable viral RNA after showing negative on RT-PCR test (intermittent negative status) were also analyzed. A total of 59 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were included in this study, with a median duration of 1 (interquartile range, IQR: 0–2) day from symptom onset to hospital admission. Median communicable period (from first day of positive nucleic acid test to first day of consecutive negative results) was 14 (IQR: 10–18) days, and 7 (IQR: 6–10) days for 10 patients with intermittent negative results. Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.205–0.698) and chest tightness (HR: 0.290; 95%CI: 0.091–0.919) were factors indecently affecting negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Headache (odds ratio: 7.553; 95%CI: 1.011–28.253) was significantly associated with intermittent negative status, with a predicted probability of 60%.

Recent reports have demonstrated the involvement of vitamin B3 in a number of pivotal functions which ensure that homeostasis is maintained. In addition, the intriguing nature of its synthesis and the underlying mechanism of action of vitamin B3 have encouraged further studies aimed at deepening our understanding of the close link between the exogenous supply of B3 and how it activates dependent enzymes. This crucial role can be attributed to the gut microflora and its ability to shape human behavior and development by mediating the bioavailability of metabolites. Recent studies have indicated a possible interconnection between the novel coronavirus and commensal bacteria. As such, we have attempted to explain how the gastrointestinal deficiencies displayed by SARS-CoV-2-infected patients arise. It seems that the stimulation of a proinflammatory cascade and the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen species culminates in the subsequent loss of host eubiosis. Studies of the relationhip between ROS, SARS-CoV-2, and gut flora are sparse in the current literature. As an integrated component, oxidative stress (OS) has been found to negatively influence host eubiosis, in vitro fertilization outcomes, and oocyte quality, but to act as a sentinel against infections. In conclusion, research suggests that in the future, a healthy diet may be considered a reliable tool for maintaining and optimizing our key internal parameters. © 2020 by the authors.","DNA; Gastrointestinal microflora; Niacin; Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Oocyte quality; Oxidative stress; SARS-CoV-2","nicotinamide; nicotinic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; dysbiosis; human; intestine flora; metabolism; oxidative stress; pandemic; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dysbiosis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Niacin; Niacinamide; Oxidative Stress; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reactive Oxygen Species","32707945","Molecules",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088678783

This has led to massive global economic disruption, placed additional strain on local and global public health resources and, above all, threatened human health. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, written in English, reporting on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This data includes previously used strategies against infectious disease, recent clinical trials and FDA-approved diagnostic and treatment strategies. The literature was obtained through a systematic search using PubMed, Web of Sciences, and FDA, NIH and WHO websites. Of the 98 references included in the review, the majority focused on pathogen and host targeting, symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma utilization. Other sources investigated vaccinations in the pipeline for the possible prevention of COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate various conventional as well as potentially advanced in vitro diagnostic approaches (IVD) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Mixed results have been observed so far when utilising these approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Some treatments have been found highly effective in specific regions of the world while others have not altered the disease process. The responsiveness of currently available options is not conclusive.

We identified airway epithelial cell types and states vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with COVID-19, epithelial cells showed an average three-fold increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, which correlated with interferon signals by immune cells. Compared to moderate cases, critical cases exhibited stronger interactions between epithelial and immune cells, as indicated by ligand–receptor expression profiles, and activated immune cells, including inflammatory macrophages expressing CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF. The transcriptional differences in critical cases compared to moderate cases likely contribute to clinical observations of heightened inflammatory tissue damage, lung injury and respiratory failure.

The most common molecular tests approved by regulatory bodies across the world for COVID-19 diagnosis are based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). While PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, specific, and remarkably reliable, they have many limitations ranging from the requirement of sophisticated laboratories, need of skilled personnel, use of complex protocol, long wait times for results, and an overall high cost per test. These limitations have inspired researchers to search for alternative diagnostic methods that are fast, economical, and executable in low-resource laboratory settings. The discovery of Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) has provided a reliable substitute platform for the accurate detection of low copy number nucleic acids in the diagnosis of several viral diseases, including epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). At present, a cocktail of LAMP assay reagents along with reverse transcriptase enzyme (Reverse Transcription LAMP, RT-LAMP) can be a robust solution for the rapid and cost-effective diagnosis for COVID-19, particularly in developing, and low-income countries. In summary, the development of RT-LAMP based diagnostic tools in a paper/strip format or the integration of this method into a microfluidic platform such as a Lab-on-a-chip may revolutionize the concept of PoCT for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review discusses the principle, technology and past research underpinning the success for using this method for diagnosing MERS and SARS, in addition to ongoing research, and the prominent prospect of RT-LAMP in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020 by the authors.

The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission are also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms.

Over 750,000 confirmed cases were reported, leading to more than 36,000 deaths. In this study, we analysed the efficiency of various intervention strategies to prevent infection by the virus, SARS-CoV-2, using an agent-based SEIIR model, in the fully urbanised city of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. Shortening the duration from symptom onset to hospital admission, quarantining recent arrivals from Hubei Province, and letting symptomatic individuals stay at home were found to be the three most important interventions to reduce the risk of infection in Shenzhen. The ideal time window for a mandatory quarantine of arrivals from Hubei Province was between 10 January and January 17, 2020, while the ideal time window for local intervention strategies was between 15 and 22 January. The risk of infection could have been reduced by 50% if all symptomatic individuals had immediately gone to hospital for isolation, and by 35% if a 14-day quarantine for arrivals from Hubei Province had been introduced one week earlier. Intervention strategies implemented in Shenzhen were effective, and the spread of infection would be controlled even if the initial basic reproduction number had doubled. Our results may be useful for other cities when choosing their intervention strategies to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19. © 2020","Agent-based model; Close contact; COVID-19; Infection spread; SEIR model","Cell proliferation; Diseases; Hospitals; Transmissions; Viruses; Agent based; Basic reproduction number; Hospital admissions; Hubei Province; Intervention methods; Intervention strategy; Shenzhen , Guangdong Province; Time windows; Disease control; COVID-19; disease control; disease transmission; epidemiology; health risk; infectious disease; respiratory disease; viral disease; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; SARS coronavirus",,"Build.

We review different biomarkers to evaluate if they are able to predict clinical outcomes and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify relevant articles using six different databases. Keywords to refine the search included ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV2’, ‘Biomarkers’, among others. Only studies which reported data on pre-defined outcomes were included. Key findings: Thirty-four relevant articles were identified which reviewed the following biomarkers: C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, cardiac troponin, renal biomarkers, lymphocytes and platelet count. Of these, all but two, showed significantly higher levels in patients with severe complications of COVID-19 infection compared to their non-severe counterparts. Lymphocytes and platelet count showed significantly lower levels in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Significance: Although research is still in its early stages, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave during the course of the disease could help clinicians in identifying severe disease earlier and subsequently improve prognosis. Nevertheless, we urge for more research across the globe to corroborate these findings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biomarkers; Blood tests; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","amyloid A protein; biological marker; C reactive protein; D dimer; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; troponin I; biological marker; C reactive protein; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; serum amyloid A; troponin I; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; disease severity; enzyme blood level; human; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; platelet count; prediction; prognosis; protein blood level; protein function; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; blood; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytology; kidney; laboratory technique; neutrophil; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Humans; Interleukin-6; Kidney; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lymphocyte Count; Neutrophils; Pandemics; Platelet Count; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Serum Amyloid A Protein; Troponin I","32405093","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084833512

The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients’ entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57–82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,"32546824","Nat.

The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti‐HIV‐1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3‐carboxyacylbetulin 3–5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the C‐terminal domain of the HIV‐1 capsid–spacer peptide 1 (CA‐CTD‐SP1) as a molecular target of HIV‐1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28‐diethoxyphosphoryl‐3‐O‐(3′,3′‐di-methylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV‐1 maturation inhibitor), has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 μM. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the prob-able interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3‐carboxyacylbetulin and C‐terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV‐1 capsid (CA)–spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD‐ SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARS‐CoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest. © 2020 by the authors.

It emerged as a global pandemic in early 2020, affecting more than 200 countries and territories. The infection is highly contagious, with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children. It spreads through person-to-person contact via aerosol and droplets. The practice of social distancing—maintaining a distance of 1-2 m or 6 ft—between people has been recommended widely to slow or halt the spread. In orthodontics, this distance is difficult to maintain, which places orthodontists at a high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection. The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during the disease crisis. This review should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control, and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March 2020 using COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19 2020), PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics. Results: This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures. Compliance with the highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak. Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines are required. Conclusions: Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within orthodontic settings. Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists, and the disease is still emerging.

In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its role may be of further importance because it is performed bedside and may limit chest X-ray and the need for transport to radiology for computed tomography (CT) scan. Since February 21, we progressively turned into a coronavirus-dedicated intensive care unit and applied an ultrasound-based approach to avoid traditional imaging and limit contamination as much as possible. We performed a complete daily examination with lung ultrasound score computation and systematic search of complications (pneumothorax, ventilator-associated pneumonia); on-duty physicians were free to perform CT or chest X-ray when deemed indicated. We compared conventional imaging exams performed in the first 4 wk of the COVID-19 epidemic with those in the same time frame in 2019: there were 84 patients in 2020 and 112 in 2019; 64 and 22 (76.2% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.001) had acute respiratory failure, respectively, of which 55 (85.9%) were COVID-19 in 2020. When COVID-19 patients in 2020 were compared with acute respiratory failure patients in 2019, the median number of chest X-rays was 1.0 (1.0–2.0) versus 3.0 (1.0–4.0) (p = 0.0098); 2 patients 2 (3.6%) versus 7 patients (31.8%) had undergone at least one thoracic CT scan (p = 0.001). A self-imposed ultrasound-based approach reduces the number of chest X-rays and thoracic CT scans in COVID-19 patients compared with patients with standard acute respiratory failure, thus reducing the number of health care providers exposed to possible contamination and sparing personal protective equipment. © 2020 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","ARDS; COVID-19; Lung monitoring; Lung ultrasound; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","Biological organs; Health care; Intensive care units; Patient monitoring; Protective clothing; Ultrasonic applications; X rays; Computed tomography scan; Conventional imaging; Health care providers; Lung ultrasound; Personal protective equipment; Respiratory failure; Systematic searches; Ventilator-associated pneumonia; Computerized tomography; acute respiratory failure; adult; aged; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; echography; epidemic; female; health care personnel; human; imaging; lung; major clinical study; male; occupational exposure; pneumothorax; priority journal; thorax radiography; ventilator associated pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; echography; lung; middle aged; occupational exposure; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; respiratory failure; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Insufficiency; Ultrasonography","32451194","Ultrasound Med.

The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients. A culture of appropriate use has to be implemented between clinicians and patients’ groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adverse drug reactions; COVID-19; Dietary supplements; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Safety; SARS-CoV-2","acetylcysteine; androstenedione; antisense oligonucleotide; arginine; branched chain amino acid; citrulline; creatine; curcumin; dystrophin; epigallocatechin gallate; eteplirsen; fish oil; glucocorticoid; glutamine; golodirsen; heparin; leucine; melatonin; nutraceutical; nutrition supplement; omega 3 fatty acid; placebo; prasterone; resveratrol; sinecatechins; taurine; ubidecarenone; unindexed drug; utrophin; vitamin D; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; abnormal sensation; acute hepatitis; acute kidney failure; acute lung injury; adjuvant therapy; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amnesia; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; angina pectoris; angioneurotic edema; anorexia; aphasia; arthralgia; asthenia; asthma; atelectasis; atrial fibrillation; attention disturbance; backache; balance disorder; bleeding; blister; bloating; blurred vision; brain hemorrhage; bronchospasm; burning sensation; cataract; cell therapy; cerebrovascular accident; cheilitis; chill; cold sweat; complete heart block; confusion; constipation; contusion; convulsion; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid induced osteoporosis; coughing; decreased appetite; dehydration; depressed blood pressure; depression; diarrhea; diet supplementation; dietary supplement; disorientation; dizziness; drug blood level; drug contamination; drug megadose; drug potentiation; drug recall; drug safety; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; dysarthria; dysgeusia; dyskinesia; dysphagia; dyspnea; ear disease; ecchymosis; elevated blood pressure; energy drink; erythema; esophagus pain; evening dosage; face edema; failure to thrive; faintness; fatigue; fever; flank pain; flatulence; gait disorder; gallbladder disease; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal symptom; gene therapy; gingiva pain; hair disease; halitosis; headache; hearing impairment; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; heart infarction; heart palpitation; heart supraventricular arrhythmia; heartburn; hematuria; hepatic encephalopathy; hepatitis; hepatomegaly; human; hypercalcemia; hyperhidrosis; hyperkalemia; hypersensitivity; hypertension; hypertransaminasemia; hyperventilation; hypesthesia; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; hypokinesia; hyponatremia; hypophosphatemia; hypotension; iatrogenic disease; insomnia; insulin resistance; iron deficiency anemia; jaundice; jaw pain; joint swelling; kidney dysfunction; kidney failure; kidney pain; kidney tubule necrosis; lethargy; limb pain; liver failure; liver pain; lymphadenopathy; malaise; migraine without aura; motor dysfunction; muscle atrophy; muscle cramp; muscle metabolism; muscle necrosis; muscle spasm; muscle strength; muscle weakness; musculoskeletal stiffness; myalgia; myopathy; myotonia; nausea; neck pain; nephrolithiasis; neurologic disease; neutropenia; nocturia; nonhuman; osteomalacia; pain; panic; papular rash; paresthesia; peripheral edema; peripheral neuropathy; peripheral swelling; phlebitis; pleura effusion; priority journal; protein synthesis; pruritus; rash; recommended drug dose; rectum hemorrhage; retinol intoxication; Review; rhabdomyolysis; sarcopenia; seizure; serum sickness; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; side effect; sinus congestion; skin discoloration; skin disease; skin exfoliation; skull fracture; sleep disorder; speech disorder; spider vein; stomach discomfort; tachycardia; thorax pain; throat tightness; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; thrush; tongue edema; transient ischemic attack; tremor; upper abdominal pain; urinary urgency; urticaria; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin D intoxication; vomiting; weakness; wheezing; xerostomia; adverse event; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; dietary supplement; drug interaction; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; health care quality; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dietary Supplements; Drug Interactions; Humans; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Standard of Care","32485610","Pharmacol.

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.",,,"32730213","IEEE Trans Med Imaging",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088907242

The framework can efficiently predict whether or not a CT scan contains pneumonia while simultaneously identifying pneumonia types between COVID-19 and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by other viruses. In the proposed method, two 3D-ResNets are coupled together into a single model for the two above-mentioned tasks via a novel prior-attention strategy. We extend residual learning with the proposed prior-attention mechanism and design a new so-called prior-attention residual learning (PARL) block. The model can be easily built by stacking the PARL blocks and trained end-to-end using multi-task losses. More specifically, one 3D-ResNet branch is trained as a binary classifier using lung images with and without pneumonia so that it can highlight the lesion areas within the lungs. Simultaneously, inside the PARL blocks, prior-attention maps are generated from this branch and used to guide another branch to learn more discriminative representations for the pneumonia-type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of COVID-19 screening. Compared to other methods, it achieves a state-of-the-art result. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to other similar clinical applications such as computer-aided detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in CT images, glaucoma lesions in Retina fundus images, etc.",,,"32730210","IEEE Trans Med Imaging",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088885507

Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease.",,,"32730214","IEEE Trans Med Imaging",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088884075

In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal–spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min–max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Decision support; Monte Carlo simulation","Decision making; Disease control; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Learning systems; Monte Carlo methods; Population statistics; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Data relationships; Epidemic development; Forecasting methods; Fuzzy rule induction; Learning network; Population densities; Possible futures; Statistical distribution; Deep learning",,"Appl.

Antibody-conjugated graphene sheets can rapidly detect targeted virus proteins and can be useful for large population screening, but also for the development of environmental sensors and filters, given the low cost of graphene materials. Functionalized graphene has demonstrated a good viral capture capacity that, combined with heat or light-mediated inactivation, could be used as a disinfectant.

Policies of health organizations for healthcare workers are inconsistent, with a change in policy in the US for universal face mask use. The aim of this study was to review the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for healthcare workers, sick patients and the general public. Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms. Results: A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study – 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts. Conclusion: The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift. This may prevent health worker infections and deaths from COVID-19, as aerosolisation in the hospital setting has been documented. © 2020","Coronavirus; Coronavirus disease; COVID19; Mask; Personal protective equipment; Respirators","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; devices; gas mask; health care personnel; human; infection control; isolation and purification; mask; occupational disease; pandemic; patient; randomized controlled trial (topic); virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Masks; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Patients; Pneumonia, Viral; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Protective Devices","32512240","Int.

Once more, it has been demonstrated that there is a lack of efficient drugs to control RNA viruses. Aptamers are efficient ligands of a great variety of molecules including proteins and nucleic acids. Their specificity and mechanism of action make them very promising molecules for interfering with the function encoded in viral RNA genomes. RNA viruses store essential information in conserved structural genomic RNA elements that promote important steps for the consecution of the infective cycle. This work describes two well documented examples of RNA aptamers with antiviral activity against highly conserved structural domains of the HIV-1 and HCV RNA genome, respectively, performed in our laboratory.

However, others, including cardiovascular conditions, do not follow clear linear patterns of change with economic development. Abnormal blood pressure is a serious health risk factor with consequences for population growth and longevity as well as public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity. This also increases the risk of the population in certain pandemics, such as COVID-19. To determine the correlation of income and blood pressure, we analyzed time-series for the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of men's population (mmHg) and nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPPC) for 136 countries from 1980 to 2008 using regression and statistical analysis by Pearson's correlation (r). Our study finds a trend similar to an inverted-U shaped curve, or a ‘Heart Kuznets Curve’. There is a positive correlation (increase GDPPC, increase SBP) in low-income countries, and a negative correlation in high-income countries (increase GDPPC, decrease SBP). As country income rises people tend to change their diets and habits and have better access to health services and education, which affects blood pressure. However, the latter two may not offset the rise in blood pressure until countries reach a certain income. Investing early in health education and preventive health care could avoid the sharp increase in blood pressure as countries develop, and therefore, avoiding the ‘Heart Kuznets Curve’ and its economic and human impacts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic development; Health policy; Heart risk factors, blood pressure; Kuznets Curve","blood; cardiovascular disease; correlation; economic development; Gross Domestic Product; income; Kuznets curve; mens health; risk factor; time series analysis",,"World Dev.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083879171

It also accelerates the decarbonization in cities, societies and built environments. To ensure the safe and secure operation of stations and capture the real-time risk status, it is imperative to consider a dynamic and smart method for managing risk factors in stations. In this research, a framework to develop an intelligent system for managing risk is suggested. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed as a powerful, intelligently selected model to improve risk management and manage uncertainties in risk variables. The objective of this study is twofold. First, we review current methods applied to predict the risk level in the flow. Second, we develop smart risk assessment and management measures (or indicators) to improve our understanding of the safety of railway stations in real-time. Two parameters are selected as input for the risk level relating to overcrowding: the transfer efficiency and retention rate of the platform. This study is the world's first to establish the hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) model, which has the potency to manage risk uncertainties and learns through artificial neural networks (ANNs) by integrated training processes. The prediction result shows very high accuracy in predicting the risk level performance, and proves the AI model capabilities to learn, to make predictions, and to capture risk level values in real time. Such risk information is extremely critical for decision making processes in managing safety and risks, especially when uncertain disruptions incur (e.g., COVID-19, disasters, etc.). The novel insights stemmed from this study will lead to more effective and efficient risk management for single and clustered railway station facilities towards safer, smarter, and more resilient transportation systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy interface systems; Neural network; Overcrowding risk; Railway station; Risk management",,,"Appl.

Understanding the underlying pathogenesis is important for disease management. With the implications from studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), this review mainly discussed the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and focused on the host immune response to viruses. Direct damage to tissues and organs and excessive inflammatory responses induced by 2019-nCoV are associated with the pathological process and disease progression. Viral load and high inflammatory response are related to disease severity. Peripheral lymphocytes are closely associated with the acute lung injury, and can be used to predict disease severity. 2019-nCoV-specific antibody and T cell immune response can be detected in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Given the two sides of inflammation and hormone therapy, steroid as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressant needs to be used with caution. Biologics targeting IL-6 and convalescent plasma therapy are promising treatment for COVID-19.

Methods: Throat swabs, sputum and blood samples, and anal swabs were collected from 104 patients with COVID-19 at admission to test for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Clinical characteristics and hematological indexes were compared between viral nucleic acid-positive and -negative groups of different sample types. Fifteen patients whose anal swabs were positive for viral nucleic acid were selected to analyze the length of time before the nucleic acid turned negative in different specimens. Results: Compared with the patients having negative anal swab test results, those having positive test results showed decreased lymphocytes, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), and higher incidence of severe COVID-19. The levels of HsCRP and IL-6 and the incidence of severe COVID-19 were significantly higher in patients with positive throat swab test results than in those with negative results. No significant difference in hematological indexes or the proportion of severe cases was detected between the patients with positive and negative sputum test results. Only 1.92% of the patients had positive blood test results, but all of them were severe patients. The positive rate of sputum test was the highest, which was 46.15%. Patients with positive results of both throat and anal swab test had significantly decreased lymphocytes, increased HsCRP and IL-6 levels, and higher incidence of critical COVID-19. It took longer time for patients to have negative anal swab and sputum test results. Moreover, it should be noticed that the viral nucleic acid in sputum might become positive again after it turned negative. Conclusions: Patients with positive anal swab test results had reduced lymphocytes, enhanced inflammatory response and higher incidence of severe COVID-19, suggesting that a positive anal swab test might be an indicator of severe COVID-19. Moreover, the time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid turning negative in anal swabs was longer than that in throat swabs. The combined detection of throat swabs and anal swabs would help to predict the occurrence of severe COVID-19.

A suitable small animal model is needed to support the development of vaccines and therapies. Here we report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in golden (Syrian) hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells and areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia at 7 days after inoculation. We also found viral antigens in epithelial cells of the duodenum, and detected viral RNA in faeces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was not as efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss on days 6–7 post-inoculation or post-contact; all hamsters returned to their original weight within 14 days and developed neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden hamsters resemble those found in humans with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"neutralizing antibody; virus antigen; virus RNA; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; virus antigen; virus RNA; antibody; cell; detection method; infectivity; inoculation; pathogenicity; RNA; rodent; virus; aerosol; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bronchus epithelium; cell hyperplasia; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; feces analysis; fomite; immunohistochemistry; inoculation; lung alveolus cell; lung alveolus epithelium cell; male; nasal lavage fluid; nonhuman; nose mucosa; pathogenesis; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Syrian hamster; viral clearance; virus transmission; animal; animal housing; Betacoronavirus; body weight loss; bronchus; Coronavirus infection; disease model; duodenum; immunology; isolation and purification; kidney; lung; Mesocricetus; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; virology; virus load; virus pneumonia; Animalia; Coronavirus; Cricetinae; Mesocricetus auratus; Rhinolophus; SARS coronavirus; Aerosols; Alveolar Epithelial Cells; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Bronchi; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Duodenum; Fomites; Housing, Animal; Kidney; Lung; Male; Mesocricetus; Nasal Mucosa; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Viral Load; Weight Loss","32408338","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084651203

We developed and evaluated a one-step colorimetric reverse-transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (COVID-19-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2, using SARS-CoV-2 isolate and respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 (n = 223) and other respiratory virus infections (n = 143). The assay involves simple equipment and techniques and low cost, without the need for expensive qPCR machines, and the result, indicated by color change, is easily interpreted by naked eyes. COVID-19-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA with detection limit of 42 copies/reaction. Of 223 respiratory samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, 212 and 219 were positive by COVID-19-LAMP at 60 and 90 min (sensitivities of 95.07% and 98.21%) respectively, with the highest sensitivities among nasopharyngeal swabs (96.88% and 98.96%), compared to sputum/deep throat saliva samples (94.03% and 97.02%), and throat swab samples (93.33% and 98.33%). None of the 143 samples with other respiratory viruses were positive by COVID-19-LAMP, showing 100% specificity. Samples with higher viral load showed shorter detection time, some as early as 30 min. This inexpensive, highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-LAMP assay can be useful for rapid deployment as mobile diagnostic units to resource-limiting areas for point-of-care diagnosis, and for unlimited high-throughput mass screening at borders to reduce cross-regional transmission.","COVID-19; diagnosis; mass screening; mobile Diagnostic; on-site screening; RT-LAMP; SARS-CoV-2","virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; colorimetry; Coronavirus infection; economics; genetics; human; isolation and purification; limit of detection; mass screening; metabolism; nasopharynx; nucleic acid amplification; pandemic; point of care system; procedures; virology; virus load; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Colorimetry; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Limit of Detection; Mass Screening; Nasopharynx; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Point-of-Care Systems; RNA, Viral; Viral Load","32751106","Int J Mol Sci",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089131052

Chinese industrial activity was impacted and the return-to-work was delayed by the combination of the Chinese New Year holiday and COVID-19 outbreak. And with the abatement of COVID-19 in China, many provinces have downgraded their emergency response levels. Industrial factories stared to re-open, and people gradually returned to their jobs. In this paper, based on the satellite data, we compared and analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of industrial hot spot and tropospheric NO2 VCDs before and after the COVID-19 outbreak to estimate the situation of return-to back rate in China. Generally, several heavy industrial sectors with high-energy consuming (e.g. smelting industries, petrochemical industries and cement industries) have a close relationship with heat-related activities, and the heat emissions can reflect the level of energy consumption to some extent. Therefore, such industrial thermal anomalies have the potential to be detected by satellites sensors with infrared channels. NO2 primarily comes from fossil fuels burning, such as industrial emissions, power plants and vehicles, and it is a key indicator of industrial activities. NO2 measured by satellite from high above Earth's surface are a good indicator of the geographical location of air pollution because NO2 has a life span of about a day, and thus is concentrated near its sources. Here, the industrial hot spots and the tropospheric NO2 Vertical Column Density (VCD) data over China during the periods from January to February in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were used for evaluating the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on China's return-to-work. The industrial hot spots were extracted from the fires/thermal anomalies results which were retrieved by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the new generation of polar-orbiting satellite, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP). The tropospheric NO2 VCD data were directly obtained from the NO2 standard product of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on Aura satellite. Our results indicate that there is a significant reduction of levels of energy consumption and NO2 emissions in February 2020, compared to those of both January 2020 and February 2019. Since the end of the Chinese New Year holiday on February 3, 2020, the number, range of distribution and density of industrial hot spots over China has been steadily rising. Except for a small amount of industrial hot spots still being detected in Wuhan, Huangshi and Ezhou, no more industrial hot spot was monitored in other cities of Hubei province in February 2020, meaning that there is no sign of return-to-work in the whole Hubei province. As the coronavirus epidemic eases in China, although the number of industrial hot spots increased remarkably over Jing-Jin-Ji region, the FRPs and tropospheric NO2 VCDs of most grids with increasing spots were still at low levels, compared to the same period in 2019. It means that production capacities of most heavy industries are limited under the influence of COVID-19 outbreak. Until the early March, both the number and averaged FRP of industrial hot spots began to gradually rise, which reflects the increasing return-to-work rate of heavy industries over most regions of China. © 2020, Science Press.

Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure. However, some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease. Till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some which are being tested for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-nCoV specifically that be supported by high-level evidence.

A specific and rapid diagnostic method is important for early identification. The reverse-transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay is a rapid detection method for several pathogens. Assays were performed within 5-15 min as a one-step single tube reaction at 39 °C. In this study, we established two RT-RAA assays for the S and orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 using clinical specimens for validation. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-RAA assay was 10 copies for the S and one copy for the orf1ab gene per reaction. Cross-reactions were not observed with any of the other respiratory pathogens. A 100% agreement between the RT-RAA and real-time PCR assays was accomplished after testing 120 respiratory specimens. These results demonstrate that the proposed RT-RAA assay will be beneficial as it is a faster, more sensitive, and more specific tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Epidemiological parameters for assessing the stage of the outbreak, such as the Effective Reproduction Number (Rt), are not always straightforward to calculate, raising barriers between the scientific community and non-scientific decision-making actors. The combination of estimators of Rt with elaborated Machine Learning-based forecasting techniques provides a way to support decision-making when assessing governmental plans of action. In this work, we develop forecast models applying logistic growth strategies and auto-regression techniques based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for each country that records information about the COVID-19 outbreak. Using the forecast for the main variables of the outbreak, namely the number of infected (I), recovered (R), and dead (D) individuals, we provide a real-time estimation of Rt and its temporal evolution within a timeframe. With such models, we evaluate Rt trends at the continental and country levels, providing a clear picture of the effect governmental actions have had on the spread. We expect this methodology of combining forecast models for raw data to calculate Rt to serve as valuable input to support decision-making related to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. © Copyright © 2020 Medina-Ortiz, Contreras, Barrera-Saavedra, Cabas-Mora and Olivera-Nappa.","COVID-19; effective reproduction number Rt; epidemiologic modeling; public-health policies; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Front.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses; however, treatment options and an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 and show that inhibition of these pathways prevents viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell-culture model for infection with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Using this cell-culture system, we determined the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and nucleic acid metabolism. Small-molecule inhibitors that target these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and have enabled the identification of drugs that inhibit viral replication. We anticipate that our results will guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of host cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Results: A novel two-step data mining method, which is based on the If-Then association rules as well as a novel discrete optimization algorithm, was introduced and applied to the synthetic repurposing of drugs for HT. The required data were also extracted from DrugBank, KEGG, and DrugR+ databases. The findings indicated that based on the different statistical criteria, the proposed method outperformed the other state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast to the previously proposed methods which had failed to discover a list on some datasets, our method could find a combination list for all of them. Conclusion: Since the proposed synthetic method uses medications in small dosages, it might revive some failed drug development projects and put forward a suitable plan for treating different diseases such as COVID-19 and HT. It is also worth noting that applying efficient computational methods helps to produce better results. © 2020 The Author(s).","Data mining; Drug repurposing; Hypertension; Optimization algorithm; Synthetic repurposing","Association rules; Data mining; Drug products; Optimization; Data mining methods; Discrete algorithms; Discrete optimization; Medical conditions; State-of-the-art approach; Statistical criterion; Synthetic methods; Therapeutic benefits; Drug dosage; antihypertensive agent; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; data mining; drug repositioning; factual database; human; machine learning; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Antihypertensive Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32677879","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088215101

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C–25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; Method; Occurrence; SARS-CoV-2; Survival; Water disinfection","Diseases; Groundwater; Health risks; Importance sampling; Potable water; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Transmissions; Viruses; Comprehensive research; Concentration method; Contaminated drinking water; Electronic database; Human enteric virus; Human-to-human transmission; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Waterborne transmission; Cobalt alloys; oxidizing agent; concentration (composition); methodology; persistence; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; wastewater; water pollution; aquatic environment; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; enteric virus; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; temperature measurement; virus transmission; water borne disease; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Middle East; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32361598","Water Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084064698

A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water. Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water. In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments. Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle. © 2020","Coronavirus; Recovery efficiency; SARS-CoV-2; Survival; Wastewater; Water","Efficiency; River pollution; Sewage; Viruses; Analytical method; Detection methods; Microbial pollution; Recovery efficiency; Removal efficiencies; Scientific literature; State of the art; Water environments; Public health; water; detection method; disease spread; disease transmission; knowledge; persistence; public health; temperature effect; virus; water treatment; agricultural slurry; biosolid; environment; environmental monitoring; human; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; public health; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; systematic review; virus detection; virus survival; virus transmission; waste water management; water cycle; water pollution; water sampling; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; public health; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","32389891","Water Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084199002

To determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands, sewage samples of six cities and the airport were tested using four qRT-PCR assays, three targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N1-N3) and one the envelope gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on February 6, 3 weeks before the first Dutch case was reported. On March 4/5, one or more gene fragments were detected in sewage of three sites, in concentrations of 2.6-30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before the first cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1-N3 up to 790-2200 gene copies per mL. This increase correlated significantly with the increase in reported COVID-19 prevalence. The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Diseases; Genes; RNA; Sewage; Viruses; Gene fragments; Netherlands; Nucleocapsids; Q-RT-PCR; RNA signals; SARS coronavirus; Polymerase chain reaction",,"Environ.

The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments. Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO2, relative humidity and temperature were recorded throughout the sampling duration. Viral RNA was extracted from samples taken from the impingers and Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was applied to confirm the positivity of collected samples based on the virus genome sequence. Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients' beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative. Despite we indicated that all air samples were negative, however, we suggest further in vivo experiments should be conducted using actual patient cough, sneeze and breath aerosols in order to show the possibility of generation of the airborne size carrier aerosols and the viability fraction of the embedded virus in those carrier aerosols. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Airborne; COVID-19; Iran; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; Tehran","Aerosols; Air quality; Dyes; Hospitals; Polymerase chain reaction; Transmissions; Viruses; Airborne; COVID-19; Iran; Outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; Tehran; Diseases; carbon dioxide; penicillin derivative; streptomycin; virus RNA; COVID-19; disease transmission; hospital sector; indoor air; measurement method; polymerase chain reaction; respiratory disease; viral disease; aerosol; air analysis; air sampling; airborne transmission; ambient air; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; gene sequence; hospital patient room; hospital subdivisions and components; humidity; intensive care unit; Iran; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; room temperature; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus genome; ward; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; health care facility; human; indoor air pollution; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollution, Indoor; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Iran; Pandemics; Patients' Rooms; Pneumonia, Viral","32283308","Sci.

Italy registered its first case in the second half of February, and in a short time period, it became the top country in Europe in terms of the number of infected people and the first in the world in terms of deaths. The medical and scientific community has been called upon to manage the emergency and to take measures. Dentists also need to take new precautions during their clinical activity to protect themselves, coworkers and patients from the risks of contagion and to avoid further spread of infection. Methods: Following the data published in the international literature as well as the guidelines and directives constantly updated by the WHO and by the national health authorities, a questionnaire to be completed anonymously was submitted online to Italian dentists using social tools and online professional platforms. The collected data were processed statistically, providing descriptive data and analysis of correlations of the most significant parameters using the Pearson's χ2, the Likelihood-Ratio χ2, Cramér's V, Fisher's exact test, Goodman and Kruskal's γ, and Kendall's τb (p < 0.05). Results: A total of 535 dentists from Italy participated in the survey. A good level of scientific knowledge about coronavirus and the extra precautionary measures needed to limit the spread was related to the age of respondents and their sex. Coming from areas with higher concentrations of cases affected knowledge, level of attention and perception of risk related to dental activity. Conclusions: At the moment, there are no therapies or vaccines to contain the infection with the new coronavirus that is causing many infections, many of which are fatal, worldwide. Dentists are one of the categories at highest risk of encountering diseases and infections because they work in close proximity with patients, and in their procedures, there is always contact with aerosols with high bacterial and viral potential. Therefore, during this COVID-19 emergency, it is important that dentists are properly informed and take the appropriate precautionary measures. © 2020 The Author(s).","2019 novel coronavirus; COVID-19; Dentistry; Health management; Knowledge; Survey","attitude to health; Betacoronavirus; child; clinical competence; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; dentist; female; human; Italy; male; pandemic; psychology; questionnaire; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Child; Clinical Competence; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dentists; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Italy; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","32650753","BMC Oral Health",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088118871

However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE). PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing. Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities. Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important. Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing. Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection. Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important. Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland. Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce mortality. © 2020 The Authors","COVID19; Healthcare workers; PPE; Resource utilization; Sterilization; Sustainability","Disinfection; Filtration; Health care; Irradiation; Sterilization (cleaning); Supply chains; Contingency planning; Global public health; High-level disinfections; Material compositions; Protective equipment; Regulatory guidance; Respiratory illness; Sterilization technology; Diseases; hydrogen peroxide; covid-19; disease transmission; disinfection; epidemic; equipment; health worker; supply chain management; viral disease; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; filtration; geographic distribution; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; instrument sterilization; Ireland; manufacturing industry; mass medium; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ultraviolet irradiation; vaporization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; virus pneumonia; Ireland; Coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Ireland; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32304970","Sci.

We previously identified the causative agent as a novel SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the entry receptor. Here, we successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 transgenic mouse (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice) infection model. The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients. Viral quantification revealed the lungs as the major site of infection, although viral RNA could also be found in the eye, heart, and brain in some mice. Virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome sequences was isolated from the infected lung and brain tissues. Last, we showed that pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could protect mice from severe pneumonia.

The new coronavirus responsible for this outbreak—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus, RaTG132. Although bats may be the reservoir host for a variety of coronaviruses3,4, it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 has additional host species. Here we show that a coronavirus, which we name pangolin-CoV, isolated from a Malayan pangolin has 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S proteins, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of pangolin-CoV is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one difference in a noncritical amino acid. Our comparative genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in the recombination of a virus similar to pangolin-CoV with one similar to RaTG13. Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 out of the 25 Malayan pangolins that we analysed. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The isolation of a coronavirus from pangolins that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that these animals have the potential to act as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. This newly identified coronavirus from pangolins—the most-trafficked mammal in the illegal wildlife trade—could represent a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"amino acid; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; E protein; guanine nucleotide binding protein; M protein; unclassified drug; vitronectin; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; envelope protein, SARS-CoV-2; M protein, Coronavirus; matrix protein; nucleocapsid protein; nucleocapsid protein, Coronavirus; virus envelope protein; global perspective; intermediate host; isolated population; population outbreak; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; genome analysis; intermediate host; lung parenchyma; metagenomics; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; Pholidota (animal); priority journal; RNA-binding domain; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; transmission electron microscopy; virus isolation; animal; bat; Betacoronavirus; China; Chlorocebus aethiops; classification; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; disease carrier; genetic recombination; genetics; genomics; host range; human; isolation and purification; lung; Malaysia; molecular evolution; pandemic; pathology; phylogeny; placental mammal; polymerase chain reaction; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; sequence homology; Vero cell line; veterinary medicine; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animalia; Coronavirus; Mammalia; Manis javanica; SARS coronavirus; Animals; Betacoronavirus; China; Chiroptera; Chlorocebus aethiops; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Eutheria; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Host Specificity; Humans; Lung; Malaysia; Nucleocapsid Proteins; Pandemics; Phylogeny; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recombination, Genetic; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vero Cells; Viral Envelope Proteins; Viral Matrix Proteins; Zoonoses","32380510","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085077331

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and production of infectious de novo virus particles. We found that viral infection elicits an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where interferon-mediated responses are efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo virus production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and fueling an exacerbated cytokine response. © 2020 The Authors","human intestinal epithelial cells; IFN; interferon; interferon lambda; interferon stimulted genes; intrinsic immunity; ISGs; organoids; SARS-CoV-2","cytokine; interferon; interferon type III; Betacoronavirus; blood; Caco-2 cell line; colon; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; cytology; epithelium cell; growth, development and aging; human; immunology; intestine mucosa; pandemic; pathology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; tumor cell line; virology; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Caco-2 Cells; Cell Line, Tumor; Colon; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Interferons; Intestinal Mucosa; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Virus Replication","32610043","Cell Rep.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087205342

It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described.

The reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) test is currently considered as the gold standard in the laboratory for the etiological detection of COVID-19. However, qRT-PCR results could be false-negative due to the inadequate sensitivity of qRT-PCR. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel one-step single-tube nested quantitative real-time PCR (OSN-qRT-PCR) assay for the highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting the ORF1ab and N genes. The sensitivity of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was 1 copy/reaction and 10-fold higher than that of the commercial qRT-PCR kit (10 copies/reaction). The clinical performance of the OSN-qRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 181 clinical samples. Among them, 14 qRT-PCR-negative samples (7 had no repetitive results and 7 had no cycle threshold (CT) values) were detected by OSN-qRT-PCR. Moreover, the 7 qRT-PCR-positives in the qRT-PCR gray zone (CT values of ORF1ab ranged from 37.48 to 39.07, and CT values of N ranged from 37.34 to 38.75) were out of the gray zone and thus were deemed to be positive by OSN-qRT-PCR, indicating that the positivity of these samples is confirmative. Compared to the qRT-PCR kit, the OSN-qRT-PCR assay revealed higher sensitivity and specificity, showing better suitability to clinical applications for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral load. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Diseases; Clinical application; Clinical performance; Health emergencies; Highly sensitive detections; Quantitative real time PCR; Real-time quantitative PCR; Reverse transcriptases; Sensitivity and specificity; Polymerase chain reaction",,"Anal.

As the number of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is increasing and the epidemic is spreading, many hospitals, laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have developed diagnostic reagents that can detect SARS-CoV-2. Currently, genome sequencing or real-time PCR is a method for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been reported cases of negative results by nucleic acid detection but confirmed on the radiological CT scan. How to improve the diagnostic efficiency and the sensitivity of molecular detection remains to be solved. To analyze the variations in viral genomic sequence may be helpful in guiding the prevention and treatment of diseases infected by SARS-CoV-2. At present, controversy still exists over the source of SARS-CoV-2 even though the probable origin is bat in nature. This article summarizes the recent findings of SARS-CoV-2 from genetic, virological and evolutionary biological perspectives. By comparing the genomic variations among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, we hope the findings can be used in the viral detection and potential antiviral therapy. Also, it will be great if we can trace the spread of the virus from one person to another, which will be an much effective way to predict and control the spread from the virus-carrier without symptoms at the incubation period to the others. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences).

Research on synthetic drugs and vaccines has become a focus of attention in China and other countries, as such approaches are regarded as key tools for disease prevention and control; however, the development of these therapeutics will take months, or even years. Under such circumstances, development of coronavirus specific therapeutics is urgent. For this specific indication, the rapid performance of natural products, such as plant compounds, herbal extracts, and traditional Chinese medicine, could contribute as alternative measures. Recent investigations have provided evidence that these natural products are potential candidates for development as therapeutic agents against the virus that causes COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. Targeting the structural proteins or cellular receptors of 2019-nCoV, including coronavirus chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro or Mpro), helicase (nsP13), S protein, and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), holds promise for preventing infection. In this review, we summarize some representative natural products and their active components that have potential anti-2019-nCoV effects. We focus on the basic structural elements of 2019-nCoV, its main mechanisms of action, and the feasibility and potential of products to inhibit the novel coronavirus. In addition, the relative advantages, additional functions, and precautions that should be used with typical natural products are also discussed. The aim is to make the case that natural products could be a valuable pool for the development of active compounds for treating 2019-nCoV infection, which may contribute to mitigation of the spread of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Zhou and Huang.","2019-nCoV; functional mechanisms; natural products; structural feature; therapeutic strategies",,,"Front.

More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far, while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment. Considering the global healthcare urgency, several techniques, including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging have been employed for diagnosing infected people. Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented. © 2020 by the authors.

Previous influenza pandemics showed that socioeconomic factors may determine both disease detection rates and overall outcomes, and preliminary data from the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic suggests that this is still true. Over the past years it has become clear that early-life adversity (ELA) plays a critical role biasing the immune system towards a pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype many years later. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be particularly sensitive to the early life social environment. As we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 it appears that a functional CTL (CD8+) response is required to clear the infection and COVID-19 severity is increased as the CD8+ response becomes somehow diminished or exhausted. This raises the hypothesis that the ELA-induced pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype may play a role in determining the clinical course of COVID-19, and the convergence of ELA-induced senescence and COVID-19 induced exhaustion represents the worst-case scenario with the least effective T-cell response. If the correct data is collected, it may be possible to separate the early life elements that have made people particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 many years later. This will, naturally, then help us identify those that are most at risk from developing the severest forms of COVID-19. In order to do this, we need to recognize socioeconomic and early-life factors as genuine medically and clinically relevant data that urgently need to be collected. Finally, many biological samples have been collected in the ongoing studies. The mechanisms linking the early life environment with a defined later-life phenotype are starting to be elucidated, and perhaps hold the key to understanding inequalities and differences in the severity of COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

Additionally, we have performed in silico predictions of SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibitory activity of a total of 50,437 compounds obtained from two anti-viral drug databases (CAS COVID-19 antiviral candidate compound database and another recently reported list of prioritized compounds from the ZINC15 database) using the developed model and provided prioritized compounds for experimental detection of their performance for SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibition. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2D-QSAR; 3CLpro enzyme; Covid-19; docking and virtual screening; MLR; SARS-CoV-2","antivirus agent; cysteine proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; drug design; drug effect; enzymology; molecular docking; pandemic; quantitative structure activity relation; statistical model; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Drug Design; Linear Models; Molecular Docking Simulation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protease Inhibitors; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship","32543892","SAR QSAR Environ.

However, due to inflammatory reactions at high vector doses, adjunctive treatment may be necessary to enhance the therapeutic outcome. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have been successfully used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Evidence suggests that at high concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can impact viral infection and replication by increasing endosomal and lysosomal pH. This effect has led to investigations into the potential benefits of these drugs in the treatment of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, at lower concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine appear to exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting nucleic acid sensors, including toll-like receptor 9 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. This dosedependent effect on their mechanism of action supports observations of increased viral infections associated with lower drug doses. In this review, we explore the immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, their impact on viral infections, and their potential to improve the efficacy and safety of retinal gene therapy by reducing AAV-induced immune responses. The safety and practicalities of delivering hydroxychloroquine into the retina will also be discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

We develop a rapid and accurate one-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay, along with a computational tool to systematically analyse the data. Our assay could detect to a limit of 15 copies of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts—based on experiments performed by spiking total human RNA with in vitro synthesized viral transcripts. The assay was evaluated by performing 184 validations for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene and human RNase P as an internal control reference gene with dilutions ranging from 1-100 ng for human RNA on a cohort of 26 clinical samples. 5 of 26 patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 21 tested negative, consistent with the standards. The accuracy of the assay was found to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific based on the 26 clinical samples that need to be further verified using a large number of clinical samples. In summary, we present a rapid, easy to implement real-time PCR based assay with automated analysis using a novel COVID qPCR Analyzer tool with graphical user interface (GUI) to analyze the raw qRT-PCR data in an unbiased manner at a cost of under $3 per reaction and turnaround time of less than 2h, to enable in-house SARS-CoV-2 testing across laboratories. © 2020 The Author(s)Infectious disease; Microbial genomics; Genomics; Molecular biology; Virology; Diagnostics; SARS-CoV-2; Real-time RT- PCR; COVID-19 detection assay; COVID qPCR analyzer; Graphical user interface (GUI) © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID qPCR analyzer; COVID-19 detection assay; Diagnostics; Genomics; Graphical user interface (GUI); Infectious disease; Microbial genomics; Molecular biology; Real-time RT- PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Virology",,,"Heliyon",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087490420

Another group of diagnostic tests, developed to overcome the limitations of RT-PCR, includes the serological assays, which have the purpose of detecting the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (IgM and IgG titers). The aim of this review was to establish the diagnostic capability of the existing serological tests in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: Electronic research was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Cochrane Library, and only 10 articles, testing 10 different types of serological assays, met the inclusion criteria and were consequently submitted to quality assessment and data extraction. Quantitative data about the sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value and IgM/IgG titer provided by each antibody test were reported in our review. Results: Almost all the serological tests used in the included items were recorded to ensure high sensitivity and specificity, identifying the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with certain COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed by RT-PCR) and in participants with suspected infection (SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnosis and/or RT-PCR negative subjects). Conclusions: Serological tests may represent reliable diagnostic tools in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they could be implemented complementary to real-time RT-PCR. © 2020 by the authors.

Early identification of infected individuals is regarded as one of the most important prerequisites for fighting the pandemic and for returning to a 'New Normal'. Large-scale testing is therefore crucial, but is facing several challenges including shortage of sample collection tools and of molecular biological reagents, and the need for safe electronic communication of medical reports. We present the successful establishment of a holistic SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that covers proband registration, sample collection and shipment, sample testing, and report issuing. The RT-PCR-based virus detection, being central to the platform,was extensively validated: Sensitivity and specificitywere defined as 96.8% and 100%, respectively; intra-run and inter-run precision were 3%. A novel type of sample swab and an in-house-developed RNAextraction systemwere shown to performas good as commercially available products. The resulting flexibility guarantees independence from the current bottlenecks in SARS-CoV-2 testing. Based on our technology, we offered testing at local, national, and global levels. In the present study, we report the results from approx. 18,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests in almost 10,000 individuals from a low-frequency SARS-CoV-2 pandemic area in a homogenous geographical region in north-eastern Germany for a period of 10 weeks (21 March to 31 May 2020). Among the probands, five SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified. Comparative analysis of corresponding virus genomes revealed a diverse origin from three of the five currently recognized SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clades. Our study exemplifies how preventive SARS-CoV-2 testing can be set up in a rapid and flexible manner. The application of our test has enabled a safe maintenance/resume of critical local infrastructure, e.g., nursing homes where more than 5000 elderlies and caretakers got tested. The strategy outlined by the present study may serve as a blueprint for the implementation of large-scale preventive SARS-CoV-2 testing elsewhere. © 2020 MDPI AG.

Based on full-genome sequence analysis, SARS-CoV-2 shows high homology to SARS-related coronaviruses identified in horseshoe bats1,2. Here we show the establishment and characterization of expandable intestinal organoids derived from horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus sinicus species that can recapitulate bat intestinal epithelium. These bat enteroids are fully susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustain robust viral replication. Development of gastrointestinal symptoms in some patients with COVID-19 and detection of viral RNA in fecal specimens suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might cause enteric, in addition to respiratory, infection3,4. Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19. Collectively, we established the first expandable organoid culture system of bat intestinal epithelium and present evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect bat intestinal cells.

Previous studies had reported the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture media and deposited onto surfaces under a limited set of environmental conditions. Here, we broadly investigated the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and droplet size on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in a simulated clinically relevant matrix dried on nonporous surfaces. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 decayed more rapidly when either humidity or temperature was increased but that droplet volume (1 to 50 l) and surface type (stainless steel, plastic, or nitrile glove) did not significantly impact decay rate. At room temperature (24°C), virus half-life ranged from 6.3 to 18.6 h depending on the relative humidity but was reduced to 1.0 to 8.9 h when the temperature was increased to 35°C. These findings suggest that a potential for fomite transmission may persist for hours to days in indoor environments and have implications for assessment of the risk posed by surface contamination in indoor environments. IMPORTANCE Mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and public spaces is critically important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while effective vaccines and therapeutics are under development. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is thought to primarily occur through direct person-to-person transfer of infectious respiratory droplets or through aerosol-generating medical procedures. However, contact with contaminated surfaces may also play a significant role. In this context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies. To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify indoor environments in which the virus is most persistent. © 2020 Biryukov et al.","Contamination; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Fomite; Half-life; Humidity; SARS-CoV-2; Temperature; Transmission","environmental factor; high temperature; humidity; limit of detection; nonhuman; Note; polymerase chain reaction; room temperature; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface property; virus inactivation; virus transmission; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; fomite; half life time; human; indoor air pollution; pandemic; physiology; porosity; saliva; SARS coronavirus; surface property; temperature; theoretical model; virology; virus pneumonia; plastic; stainless steel; Air Pollution, Indoor; Coronavirus Infections; Fomites; Half-Life; Humans; Humidity; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Plastics; Pneumonia, Viral; Porosity; Saliva; SARS Virus; Stainless Steel; Surface Properties; Temperature; Virus Inactivation","32611701","mSphere",Note,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087472792

Serological diagnostic tests are being increasingly used to provide a broader understanding of COVID-19 incidence and to assess immunity status in the population. However, there are discrepancies between claimed and actual performance data for serological diagnostic tests on the market. In this study, we conducted a review of independent studies evaluating the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests.

Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus infecting the lungs with fever, dry cough, and acute pneumonia being the major symptoms. It infects epithelial cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is crucial for viral entry. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately there are various reports that substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including brain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and MERS along with possibilities of viral entry into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The review provides detailed information about the virulence, epidemiology, and insights into molecular pathways involved in the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with an in-depth view of current concepts about the neurological significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neuropathological competence.

Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce changes in Watson–Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2-permissive host cells, we identified ten separate target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; three of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease, is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the human host is constrained by host miRNA defences. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and a potential platform for engineering conditional attenuation to vaccine development, as well as providing a better understanding of viral tropism and pathogenesis. © 2020 by the authors.","Conserved mutation; MiRNA; RNA secondary structure; SARS-CoV-2","microRNA; microRNA 197; microRNA 338; microRNA 4661; microRNA 4761; nonstructural protein 4; polypyrimidine tract binding protein; unclassified drug; microRNA; nsp2 protein, SARS-CoV-2; viral protein; virus RNA; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; Article; binding site; conserved sequence; controlled study; down regulation; gene mutation; gene overexpression; gene sequence; gene targeting; genetic conservation; host; host resistance; human; mutational analysis; nonhuman; nucleic acid base substitution; nucleotide sequence; RNA splice site; RNA structure; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single nucleotide polymorphism; viral tropism; virus load; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; conformation; Coronavirus infection; genetic database; genetics; metabolism; mutation; pandemic; pathology; RNA splicing; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; 3' Untranslated Regions; Base Sequence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Genetic; Genome, Viral; Humans; MicroRNAs; Mutation; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA Splice Sites; RNA Splicing; RNA, Viral; Sequence Alignment; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Viral Proteins","32645951","Int.

Here, we report a 382-nucleotide (nt) deletion in SARS-CoV-2 that truncates open reading frame 7b (ORF7b) and ORF8, removing the ORF8 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and eliminating ORF8 transcription. The earliest 382-nt deletion variant was detected in Singapore on 29 January 2020, with the deletion viruses circulating in the country and accounting for 23.6% (45/191) of SARS-CoV-2 samples screened in this study. SARS-CoV-2 with the same deletion has since been detected in Taiwan, and other ORF7b/8 deletions of various lengths, ranging from 62 nt to 345 nt, have been observed in other geographic locations, including Australia, Bangladesh, and Spain. Mutations or deletions in ORF8 of SARS-CoV have been associated with reduced rep-licative fitness and virus attenuation. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 382-nt deletion viruses showed significantly higher replicative fitness in vitro than the wild type, while no difference was observed in patient viral load, indicating that the deletion variant viruses retained their replicative fitness. A robust antibody response to ORF8 has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the emergence of ORF8 deletions may be due to immune-driven selection and that further deletion variants may emerge during the sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. IMPORTANCE During the SARS epidemic in 2003/2004, a number of deletions were observed in ORF8 of SARS-CoV, and eventually deletion variants became predomi-nant, leading to the hypothesis that ORF8 was an evolutionary hot spot for adapta-tion of SARS-CoV to humans. However, due to the successful control of the SARS epidemic, the importance of these deletions for the epidemiological fitness of SARS-CoV in humans could not be established. The emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains with ORF8 deletions, combined with evidence of a robust immune response to ORF8, suggests that the lack of ORF8 may assist with host immune evasion. In ad-dition to providing a key insight into the evolutionary behavior of SARS-CoV-2 as the virus adapts to its new human hosts, the emergence of ORF8 deletion variants may also impact vaccination strategies. © 2020 Su et al.","COVID-19; Natural selection; ORF8; Phylogeny; Vaccines","nucleotide; antibody response; Article; Australia; Bangladesh; gene deletion; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic regulation; genetic transcription; genetic variability; geography; in vitro study; nonhuman; open reading frame; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Spain; Taiwan; virus load; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; gene deletion; genetics; human; immunology; nucleotide sequence; physiology; virus genome; Base Sequence; Betacoronavirus; Genome, Viral; Humans; Open Reading Frames; Sequence Deletion; Virus Replication","32694143","mBio",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088167636

Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions.

The responsible virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is mainly characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath. In severe cases, the disease can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, which are mostly fatal for the patient. The severity of disease progression was hypothesized to be related to an overshooting immune response and was correlated with age and comorbidities, including cancer. A lot of research has lately been focused on the pathogenesis and acute consequences of COVID-19. However, the possibility of longterm consequences caused by viral infections which has been shown for other viruses are not to be neglected. In this regard, this opinion discusses the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer with special focus on the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage caused by infection. We summarize the available literature on COVID-19 suggesting an increased risk for severe disease progression in cancer patients, and we discuss the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to cancer development.

The results were compared to that of standard approach that involves RNA extraction. Incubation of specimens at 65°C for 10 minutes along with the use of TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than many other conditions tested. The optimized direct RT-qPCR approach demonstrated a limit of detection of 6.6x103 copy/ml and high reproducibility (co-efficient of variation = 1.2%). In 132 nasopharyngeal specimens submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our optimized approach were 95%, 99% and 98.5%, respectively, with reference to the standard approach. Also, the RT-qPCR CT values obtained by the two methods were positively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.6971, p = 0.0013). The rate of PCR inhibition by the direct approach was 8% compared to 9% by the standard approach.

Nevertheless, this possibility has been already suggested by previous studies on other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To describe the state of the art of coronaviruses and airborne transmission, a systematic review was carried out using the PRISMA methodology. Overall, 64 papers were selected and classified into three main groups: laboratory experiments (12 papers), air monitoring (22) and epidemiological and airflow model studies (30). The airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is suggested by the studies of the three groups, but none has yet obtained complete evidence. The sampling and detection methods have not been validated, therefore monitoring results are affected by a possible underestimation. Then, epidemiological investigations only hypothesize the airborne transmission as a possible explanation for some illness cases, but without estimating its attributable risk. Nevertheless, while waiting for more evidence, it is urgent to base advice on preventive measures, such as the use of masks, safe distancing and air ventilation, on the precautionary principle. © 2020 by the authors.","Air models; Air monitoring; Airborne transmission; Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Epidemiological studies; Human coronaviruses; SARS-CoV-2; Survival in air","Risk perception; Airborne transmission; Attributable risks; Detection methods; Laboratory experiments; Monitoring results; Precautionary principle; Preventive measures; Systematic Review; Transmissions; airflow; COVID-19; disease control; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; experimental study; respiratory disease; Animalia; SARS coronavirus",,"Atmosphere",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088102187

We reviewed current evidence related to the impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on dental care and oral health with the aim to help dental professionals better understand the risks of disease transmission in dental settings, strengthen protection against nosocomial infections, and identify areas of COVID-19–related oral health research. When compared with other recent pandemics, COVID-19 is less severe but spreads more easily, causing a significantly higher number of deaths worldwide. Protection of dental patients and staff during COVID-19 is challenging due to the existence of patients who are infectious yet asymptomatic. Dental professionals are ill prepared for the pandemic, as they are not routinely fitted for the N95 respirators now required for preventing contagion during dental treatments. Biological and clinical evidence supports that oral mucosa is an initial site of entry for SARS-CoV-2 and that oral symptoms, including loss of taste/smell and dry mouth, might be early symptoms of COVID-19, presenting before fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness breath, and other typical symptoms. Oral health researchers may play a more active role in early identification and diagnosis of the disease through deciphering the mechanisms of dry mouth and loss of taste in patients with COVID-19. Rapid testing for infectious diseases in dental offices via saliva samples may be valuable in the early identification of infected patients and in disease progress assessment. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This commentary provides a timely evidence-based overview on the impact of COVID-19 on dental care and oral health and identifies gaps in protection of patients and staff in dental settings. Oral symptoms are prominent before fever and cough occur.

To curb the spreading of the virus, WHO urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing; thus, a rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed. We applied a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to achieve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min. We designed four sets of LAMP primers (6 primers in each set), targeting the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions of orf1ab, S gene and N gene. A colorimetric change was used to report the results, which enables the outcome of viral RNA amplification to be read by the naked eye without the need of expensive or dedicated instrument. The sensitivity can be 80 copies of viral RNA per ml in a sample. We validated the RT-LAMP method in a hospital in China, employing 16 clinic samples with 8 positives and 8 negatives. The testing results are consistent with the conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we also show that one-step process without RNA extraction is feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample. This rapid, simple and sensitive RT-LAMP method paves a way for a large screening at public domain and hospitals, particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areas. © 2020 The Authors.

Pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Virus-host relationship system","coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; mortality; nonhuman; Note; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease resistance; genetic selection; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunity; immunology; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; virus replication; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; COVID-19 vaccine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; virus vaccine; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Resistance; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Selection, Genetic; Viral Vaccines; Virus Replication","32350571","Inflamm.

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is the key in containing the pandemic and breaking the chain of transmission. In low- and middle-income countries availability of testing kits has become the major bottleneck in testing. Novel methods like pooling of samples are the need of the hour. Objective We undertook this study to evaluate a novel protocol of pooling of RNA samples/elutes in performance of PCR for SARS CoV-2 virus. Study design Extracted RNA samples were randomly placed in pools of 8 on a 96 well plate. Both individual RNA (ID) and pooled RNA RT-qPCR for the screening E gene were done in the same plate and the positivity for the E gene was seen. Results The present study demonstrated that pool testing with RNA samples can easily detect even up to a single positive sample with Ct value as high as 38. The present study also showed that the results of pool testing is not affected by number of positive samples in a pool. Conclusion Pooling of RNA samples can reduce the time and expense, and can help expand diagnostic capabilities, especially during constrained supply of reagents and PCR kits for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Gupta et al.

SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging. Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake. © 2020","Coronavirus; Influenza season; Influenza vaccination; Limited resources; Pandemic outbreak","Health care; Health risks; Public health; Detection capability; Health interventions; Health-care system; Infectious agents; Influenza vaccines; Life-threatening infections; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Public authorities; Vaccines; influenza vaccine; influenza vaccine; COVID-19; detection method; epidemiology; influenza; public health; respiratory disease; vaccination; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; epidemic; evidence based medicine; flu like syndrome; health care availability; health care facility; health care utilization; hospital admission; infectious agent; influenza; influenza vaccination; mass immunization; mathematical model; medical decision making; pandemic; public health service; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus transmission; communicable disease control; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; influenza; mixed infection; pandemic; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Coinfection; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemics; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Mass Vaccination; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32425244","Math.

Methods: 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. We used two comprehensive 11-colour flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice and approved for clinical diagnostics. Findings: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and γδ T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. Interpretation: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Understanding T cell-responses in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.

These conditions include thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications. Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

Nucleic-acid-based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection of COVID-19. However, the “gold standard” test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes several hours to complete and requires extensive human labor, materials such as RNA extraction kits that could become in short supply, and relatively scarce qPCR machines. It is clear that a huge effort needs to be made to scale up current COVID-19 testing by orders of magnitude. There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages. There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the “gold-standard” CDC RT-PCR test. Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles. Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own laboratories. We hope that this review can urgently consolidate and disseminate information to aid researchers in designing and implementing optimized COVID-19 testing protocols to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing. © 2020 Esbin et al.

Following an extensive literature search, we identified 24 eligible studies, including a total of 624 pediatric cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, which report data on 27 different biomarkers. We then performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates (PPE) for these laboratory abnormalities in mild COVID-19. As data was too limited for children with severe COVID-19 to allow pooling, results were presented descriptively in a summary of findings table. Our data show an inconsistent pattern of change in the leukocyte index of mild and severe cases of COVID-19 in children. Specifically, changes in leukocyte counts were only observed in 32% of the mild pediatric cases (PPE: 13% increase, 19% decrease). In mild disease, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was frequently elevated, with a PPE of 33%. In severe disease, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were frequently elevated. Based on data obtained from early COVID-19 studies, leukocyte indices in children appear inconsistent, differing from those reported in adults that highlight specific leukocyte trends. This brings into question the utility and reliability of such parameters in monitoring disease severity in the pediatric population. Instead, we suggest physicians to serially monitor CRP, PCT, and LDH to track the course of illness in hospitalized children. Finally, elevated CK-MB in mild pediatric COVID-19 cases is indicative of possible cardiac injury. This highlights the importance of monitoring cardiac biomarkers in hospitalized patients and the need for further investigation of markers such as cardiac troponin in future studies. © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists","Biomarkers; Clinical chemistry; Inflammation; Pediatrics; SARS-CoV-2","biological marker; C reactive protein; creatine kinase MB; lactate dehydrogenase; procalcitonin; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; blood; child; clinical chemistry; Coronavirus infection; female; hospitalization; human; infant; leukocyte count; male; meta analysis; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; severity of illness index; virology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Chemistry, Clinical; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Leukocyte Count; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Procalcitonin; Severity of Illness Index","32473151","Clin.

Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe and critical illness, spurred on by excessive inflammation that can lead to respiratory or multiorgan failure. Numerous studies have established the unique array of cytoprotective properties of the dietary amino acid ergothioneine. Based on studies in a range of in vitro and in vivo models, ergothioneine has exhibited the ability to modulate inflammation, scavenge free radicals, protect against acute respiratory distress syndrome, prevent endothelial dysfunction, protect against ischemia and reperfusion injury, protect against neuronal damage, counteract iron dysregulation, hinder lung and liver fibrosis, and mitigate damage to the lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and testis, amongst many others. When compiled, this evidence suggests that ergothioneine has a potential application in the treatment of the underlying pathology of COVID-19. We propose that ergothioneine could be used as a therapeutic to reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19, especially in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. This review presents evidence to support that proposal. © 2020 by the authors.

Subsequently, ten years after the initial SARS cases occurred in 2002, new cases of another atypical respiratory disease caused worldwide concern. This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS. Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019. For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent. In sum, SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are caused by recently discovered coronaviruses that cause flu-like illnesses, but with a clinical outcome that tends to be more severe.

This is a really important issue for dentistry, where we place great emphasis on infection control and universal precautions, given the nature of care provided. Cochrane have recently updated their review of PPE for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff. It examined evidence on which type of full body PPE and which method of donning (putting on) or doffing (removing) are most effective, while having the least risk of contamination or infection for healthcare workers, as well as which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. The objective of this paper is to raise awareness of the above review of PPE, its findings and their relevance to dentistry as outlined in the Cochrane Oral Health website. The available evidence comes from healthcare generally, mostly involving simulation exercises, and is of low or very low certainty. None of the evidence specifically comes from dentistry. The findings in relation to the nature of PPE, methods of donning and doffing, and the importance of training are all of practical relevance to dentistry.

Long ICU hospitalization exposes patients to a high risk of wasting and loss of lean body mass. The complex management precludes the detection of anthropometric parameters for the definition and monitoring of the nutritional status. The use of imaging diagnostics for body composition could help to recognize and treat patients at increased risk of wasting with targeted pathways. COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU underwent computed tomography within 24 hours and about 20 days later, to evaluate the parameters of the body and liver composition. The main results were the loss of the lean mass index and a greater increase in liver attenuation in obese subjects. These could be co-caused by COVID-19, prolonged bed rest, the complex medical nutritional therapy, and the starting condition of low-grade inflammation of the obese. The assessment of nutritional status, with body composition applied to imaging diagnostics and metabolic profiles in COVID-19, will assist in prescribing appropriate medical nutritional therapy. This will reduce recovery times and complications caused by frailty. © 2020 by the authors.

Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% of patients require intensive care2. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines3,4 that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes5,6, lymphopenia7,8 and T cell exhaustion9,10. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element of high importance for human health and particularly for a well-balanced immune response. The mortality risk from a severe disease like sepsis or polytrauma is inversely related to Se status. We hypothesized that this relation also applies to COVID-19. Serum samples (n = 166) from COVID-19 patients (n = 33) were collected consecutively and analyzed for total Se by X-ray fluorescence and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) by a validated ELISA. Both biomarkers showed the expected strong correlation (r = 0.7758, p < 0.001), pointing to an insufficient Se availability for optimal selenoprotein expression. In comparison with reference data from a European cross-sectional analysis (EPIC, n = 1915), the patients showed a pronounced deficit in total serum Se (mean ± SD, 50.8 ± 15.7 vs. 84.4 ± 23.4 µg/L) and SELENOP (3.0 ± 1.4 vs. 4.3 ± 1.0 mg/L) concentrations. A Se status below the 2.5th percentile of the reference population, i.e., [Se] < 45.7 µg/L and [SELENOP] < 2.56 mg/L, was present in 43.4% and 39.2% of COVID samples, respectively. The Se status was significantly higher in samples from surviving COVID patients as compared with non-survivors (Se; 53.3 ± 16.2 vs. 40.8 ± 8.1 µg/L, SELENOP; 3.3 ± 1.3 vs. 2.1 ± 0.9 mg/L), recovering with time in survivors while remaining low or even declining in non-survivors. We conclude that Se status analysis in COVID patients provides diagnostic information. However, causality remains unknown due to the observational nature of this study. Nevertheless, the findings strengthen the notion of a relevant role of Se for COVID convalescence and support the discussion on adjuvant Se supplementation in severely diseased and Se-deficient patients. © 2020 by the authors.

The sudden outbreak of this disease is being considered a pandemic. Given all this, it is essential to develop smart biosensors that can detect pathogens with minimum time delay. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors make use of refractive index (RI) changes as the sensing parameter. In this work, based on actual data taken from previous experimental works done on plasmonic detection of viruses, a detailed simulation of the SPR scheme that can be used to detect the COVID-19 virus is performed and the results are extrapolated from earlier schemes to predict some outcomes of this SPR model. The results indicate that the conventional Kretschmann configuration can have a limit of detection (LOD) of 2E-05 in terms of RI change and an average sensitivity of 122.4 degRIU−1 at a wavelength of 780 nm. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Early detection and containment are currently the most effective methods for controlling the outbreak. A positive diagnosis is determined by laboratory real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, but the use of chest computed tomography (CT) has also been indicated as an important tool for detection and management of the disease. Numerous studies reviewed in this paper largely concur in their findings that the early hallmarks of COVID-19 infection are ground-glass opacities (GGOs), often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution. In addition, most studies demonstrated similar CT findings related to the progression of the disease, starting with GGOs in early disease, followed by the development of crazy paving in middle stages and finally increasing consolidation in the later stages of the disease. Studies have reported a low rate of misdiagnosis by chest CT, as well as a high rate of misdiagnosis by the rRT-PCR tests. Specifically, chest CT provides more accurate results in the early stages of COVID-19, when it is critical to begin treatment as well as isolate the patient to avoid the spread of the virus. While rRT-PCR will probably remain the definitive final test for COVID-19, until it is more readily available and can consistently provide higher sensitivity, the use of chest CT for early stage detection has proven valuable in avoiding misdiagnosis as well as monitoring the progression of the disease. With the understanding of the role of chest CT, researchers are beginning to apply deep learning and other algorithms to differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT scans, determine the severity of the disease to guide the course of treatment, and investigate numerous additional COVID-19 applications. Impact statement: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been worldwide, and clinicians and researchers around the world have been working to develop effective and efficient methods for early detection as well as monitoring of the disease progression. This minireview compiles the various agency and expert recommendations, along with results from studies published in numerous countries, in an effort to facilitate the research in imaging technology development to benefit the detection and monitoring of COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated how COVID-19 cases affected Indian energy consumption during the COVID-19 crisis by testing if the lockdown release had a positive impact on energy consumption and if richer regions were quicker to recover their energy consumption to the level before the lockdown. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the study reveals that a long-run relationship holds between the COVID-19 cases and energy consumption and that the COVID-19 cases have a positive effect on Indian energy consumption. This result indicates that as lockdown relaxed, energy consumption started to recover. However, such a positive impact was not apparent in the Eastern and North-Eastern regions, which are the poorest regions among the five regions investigated in the study.

Second, Donald Trump and Barak Obama show the opposite result for the in-degree centrality and follower analysis. The result shows that the topic-based networks and the person-based networks play a different role in social networks. This study demonstrates that the presidents, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, the Centers for Disease Control, and news channels play a crucial role in the news of COVID-19 for people. Key players, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and BBC, are located in the central networks. In contrast, U.S. news channels and WHO and its regional offices have independent channels.

The control of epidemics such as COVID-19 can be managed effectively by exploiting edge computation through the 5G wireless connectivity network. The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that utilizes the 5G network's low-latency, high-bandwidth functionality to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images, and to develop a mass surveillance system to monitor social distancing, mask wearing, and body temperature. Three DL models, ResNet50, Deep tree, and Inception v3, are investigated in the proposed framework. Furthermore, blockchain technology is also used to ensure the security of healthcare data. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Disease control; Edge computing; Health care; Large dataset; Professional aspects; Security systems; Body temperature; Computing system; EDGE technology; Healthcare sectors; High bandwidth; Infectious disease; Surveillance systems; Wireless connectivities; 5G mobile communication systems",,"IEEE Network",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089191150

The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","coronavirus disease 2019; diagnosis; pneumonia; radiomics","Cluster analysis; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Support vector machines; Calibration curves; Chronic disease; Consensus clustering; Cross validation; Disease diagnosis; Predictive abilities; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Stratified analysis; Computerized tomography",,"Sci.

In this study, patients with verified COVID-19 disease hospitalized at the intensive care unit and treated with ventilator and extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were evaluated with LUS for pulmonary changes. LUS findings were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and ventilator settings. Ten patients were included and scanned the day after initiation of ECMO and thereafter every second day until, if possible, weaned from ECMO. In total 38 scans adding up to 228 cineloops were recorded and analyzed off-line with the use of a constructed LUS score. The study indicated that patients with a trend of lower LUS scores over time were capable of being weaned from ECMO. LUS score was associated to CRP (R = 0.34; p < 0.03) and compliance (R = 0.60; p < 0.0001), with the strongest correlation to compliance.

METHODS: We used the TriNetX platform to analyze 20 health care institutions that have relevant, up-to-date encounter data. Using this COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN), we compared cancer cohorts identified by querying encounter data pre-COVID (January 2019-April 2019) and current (January 2020-April 2020). Cohorts were generated for all patients with neoplasms (malignant, benign, in situ, and of unspecified behavior), with new incidence neoplasms (first encounter), with exclusively malignant neoplasms, and with new incidence malignant neoplasms. Data from a UK institution were similarly analyzed. Additional analyses were performed on patients with selected cancers, as well as on those having had cancer screening. RESULTS: Clear trends were identified that suggest a significant decline in all current cohorts explored, with April 2020 displaying the largest decrease in the number of patients with cancer having encounters. Of the cancer types analyzed, lung, colorectal, and hematologic cancer cohorts exhibited smaller decreases in size in April 2020 versus 2019 (-39.1%, -39.9%, -39.1%, respectively) compared with cohort size decreases for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (-47.7%, -49.1%, -51.8%, respectively). In addition, cancer screenings declined drastically, with breast cancer screenings dropping by -89.2% and colorectal cancer screenings by -84.5%. CONCLUSION: Trends seen in the CCRN clearly suggest a significant decrease in all cancer-related patient encounters as a result of the pandemic. The steep decreases in cancer screening and patients with a new incidence of cancer suggest the possibility of a future increase in patients with later-stage cancer being seen initially as well as an increased demand for cancer screening procedures as delayed tests are rescheduled.",,"classification; clinical trial; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; early cancer diagnosis; female; human; incidence; male; multicenter study; neoplasm; pandemic; United Kingdom; United States; virus pneumonia; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United Kingdom; United States","32716647","JCO Clin Cancer Inform",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088812978

Considering the different dimensions of space through which an outbreak unfolds, facilitates analysing spatial diffusion of infectious disease in contemporary societies. We attempt to highlight four relevant dimensions of space by applying the TPSN framework to the case of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Germany. By identifying key processes of disease diffusion in space, we can explain the spatial patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, which did not feature the well-known patterns of spatially contagious as in or hierarchical diffusion. In contrast, we find superspreading events and especially relocation diffusion based on existing networks, on which the pathogen travelled like a blind passenger, to be more relevant. For us, these findings prove the value of combining relational thinking with geographic analysis for understanding epidemic outbreaks in contemporary societies. © 2020 The Authors.

A cytokine storm in some patients after infection contributes to this mortality. In addition to lungs, the intestine is targeted during COVID-19 infection. The intestinal membrane serves as a barrier to prevent leakage of microorganisms and their products into the bloodstream; however, dietary fats can affect the gut microbiome and may increase intestinal permeability. In obese or diabetic individuals, there is an increase in the abundance of either Gram-negative bacteria in the gut or their prod-uct, endotoxin, in systemic circulation. We speculate that when the COVID-19 infection localizes in the intestine and when the permeability properties of the intestinal membrane are compromised, an inflammatory response is generated when proin-flammatory endotoxin, produced by resident Gram-negative bacteria, leaks into the systemic circulation.

The two events were supposed to be correlated, also based on the limited information available about the new virus. Despite that clear indications about the role of particulate matter (PM) in the virus mechanism dispersion cannot be found in literature, some researchers supposed that PM can act as virus carrier, promoting its diffusion through the air. This paper, for the first time, analyses the PM10 situation in Lombardy (from 10th February to March 27, 2020), several days before the sanitary emergency explosion. The data of the detected infection cases are reported and discussed parallelly. As a comparison, the situation of Piedmont, located near to the Lombardy is also presented. Data are reported for Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano, Monza-Brianza, Pavia (Lombardy), Alessandria, Vercelli, Novara, Biella, Asti, and Torino (Piedmont). The results show that it is not possible to conclude that COVID-19 diffusion mechanism also occurs through the air, by using PM10 as a carrier. In particular, it is shown that Piedmont cities, presenting lower detected infections cases in comparison to Brescia and Bergamo in the investigated period, had most sever PM10 pollution events in comparison to Lombardy cities.

It has also come to the world’s attention that spraying of disinfectants has been especially used on people who are migrating from one part of the country to another. In this letter, I have made an attempt to discuss some major impacts of NaOCl on human health as well as atmospheric chemistry. NaOCl once emitted into the air reacts easily with the water vapor to form HOCl that further gets photo-dissociated into various reactive species. These reactive species have significant potentials to participate in various tropospheric chemistry of chlorine radical, ozone, S (IV) oxidation, hydrocarbon oxidation, modification of chloride salts etc. I have also recommended some important steps to be taken if spraying of NaOCl is deemed essential. © The Author(s).","COVID-19; Disinfectants; NaOCl solution","Chlorine compounds; Disinfectants; Office buildings; Sodium compounds; Chlorine radicals; Commercial building; Current situation; Hydrocarbon oxidation; Hypochlorite solutions; Public road transports; Reactive species; Tropospheric chemistry; Atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric chemistry; disinfection; public health; troposphere; virus; India",,"Aerosol Air Qual.

As treatments are often not available, early detection of an eventual infection and its level becomes of outmost importance. Nanomaterials and nanotechnological approaches are increasingly used in the field of viral sensing to address issues related to signal-to-noise ratio, limiting the sensitivity of the sensor. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MPs) present one of the most exciting prospects for magnetic bead-based viral aggregation assays and their integration into different biosensing strategies as they can be easily separated from a complex matrix containing the virus through the application of an external magnetic field. Despite the enormous potential of MPs as capture/pre-concentrating elements, they are not ideal with regard of being active elements in sensing applications as they are not the sensor element itself. Even though engineering of magneto-plasmonic nanostructures as promising hybrid materials directly applicable for sensing due to their plasmonic properties are often used in sensing, to our surprise, the literature of magneto-plasmonic nanostructures for viral sensing is limited to some examples. Considering the wide interest this topic is evoking at present, the different approaches will be discussed in more detail and put into wider perspectives for sensing of viral disease markers. © 2020 by the authors.

Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARSCoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR-0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ?3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ?2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into ""probably positive""and ""probably negative""cohorts. © 2020 Gietema et al.",,"adult; aged; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; CURB 65 score; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease course; emergency ward; female; high risk patient; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; Netherlands; prospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; sepsis; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; virus virulence; Coronavirus infection; hospital emergency service; middle aged; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; statistical model; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32645053","PLoS ONE",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087826039

LUDH followed Royal College recommendations by taking extraoral radiographs in preference to intraoral radiographs due to the risk of inducing an aerosol. Issues were identified with clinical diagnosis from sectional panoramic radiographs, which led to the introduction of extraoral bitewings being taken as an alternative. A quality assurance audit found that these images provided a substantially lower radiation dose and produced excellent quality images with improved diagnostic accuracy.

Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network. Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks. We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent efforts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of artificial intelligence.

The aim of the present study is to dissect the chemical composition and the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD), a clinically used Chinese medicine for treating COVID-19 patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 129 compounds of QFPD were putatively identified. We also constructed molecular networking of mass spectrometry data to classify these compounds into 14 main clusters, in which exhibited specific patterns of flavonoids (45 %), glycosides (15 %), carboxylic acids (10 %), and saponins (5 %). The target network model of QFPD, established by predicting and collecting the targets of identified compounds, indicated a pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) in the therapeutic efficacy of QFPD. Supportively, through transcriptomic analysis of gene expression after MXSG administration in rat model of LPS-induced pneumonia, the thrombin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were suggested to be essential pathways for MXSG mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, changes in content of major compounds in MXSG during decoction were found by the chemical analysis. We also validate that one major compound in MXSG, i.e. glycyrrhizic acid, inhibited TLR agonists induced IL-6 production in macrophage. In conclusion, the integration of in silico and experimental results indicated that the therapeutic effects of QFPD against COVID-19 may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of MXSG, which supports the rationality of the compatibility of TCM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amygdalin (PubChem CID: 656516); Baicalin (PubChem CID: 64982); Corona virus disease 2019; Ephedrine (PubChem CID: 9294); Glycyrrhizic acid (PubChem CID: 14982); Hesperidin (PubChem CID: 10621); Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction; Narirutin (PubChem CID: 442431); Neohesperidin (PubChem CID: 442439); Network pharmacology; Qingfei Paidu Decoction; Traditional Chinese medicine","carboxylic acid; cytokine; flavonoid; glycoside; glycyrrhizic acid; herbaceous agent; interleukin 6; Ma Xing Shi Gan decoction; moxifloxacin; prednisone acetate; Qingfei Paidu decoction; saponin; thrombin; toll like receptor; toll like receptor agonist; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; glycyrrhizic acid; herbaceous agent; interleukin 6; lipopeptide; lipopolysaccharide; maxingshigan; Pam(3)CSK(4) peptide; qingfei paidu decoction; toll like receptor; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; China; Chinese medicine; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; experimental study; gene expression; global health; human; immunocompetent cell; inflammation; intestine flora; liquid chromatography; macrophage; male; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; therapy effect; transcriptomics; ultra performance liquid chromatography; animal; Betacoronavirus; cell culture; computer simulation; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; pandemic; pneumonia; virus pneumonia; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cells, Cultured; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Gene Expression; Glycyrrhizic Acid; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lipopeptides; Lipopolysaccharides; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Rats; Signal Transduction; Thrombin; Toll-Like Receptors","32360484","Pharmacol.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology.

Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring Rt reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates Rt using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant Rt changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in Rt, and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example. Our results explore the relationships among estimate precision, forecast reliability and model complexity. © 2020 Parag, Donnelly.

However, in Africa, much of the emphasis on BE is placed on economic gains; as a result, traditional livelihoods and small-scale local operations are outcompeted by international corporations and government initiatives, with little or no regard for social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We argue that successful BE initiatives in Africa accentuate the involvement of local communities and promote sustenance of the natural ecosystem. We define success in terms of the sustainability balance among ecological, social and economic aspects. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, observational data and literature review of case studies across the African continent, we highlight two critical findings. First, large scale BE initiatives prioritize economic gains at the expense of environmental degradation and the exclusion of local communities. Second, using the full spectrum sustainability (FSS) evaluation, we show that successful BE interventions considered ecological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional objectives. Drawing on these case studies, we propose the adoption of a collaborative framework which amalgamates the top-down and bottom-up approaches to BE management. Achieving the goal of successful blue growth in Africa is now even more challenged by the implications of COVID-19 on the BE sectors. Reimagining and rebuilding a resilient BE in Africa post-coronavirus will require a strong political commitment to promoting a balance between economic, social and environmental benefits in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. © 2020 Okafor-Yarwood, Kadagi, Miranda, Uku, Elegbede and Adewumi.","Agenda 2063; Collaborative blue management; Ecosystem conservation; Ocean economy; Social equity",,,"Front.

Methods: Throat swabs and sputum were sampled in pairs from 78 patients before discharge and sampled in pairs twice from 54 cases with an interval of 1-5 d. Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the virus in the two types of samples. Throat swab, sputum and fecal samples of six patients were tested for 2019-nCoV during follow-up. Results: The detection rate of viral nucleic acid was 46.15% in throat swabs and 50.00% in sputum samples. Test results of the second paired samples showed that the detection rate of viral nucleic acid was 25.93% in throat swabs and 46.30% in sputum samples, and the difference between the two types of samples was statistically significant (P<0.05). During follow-up, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid could be detected in the fecal samples of the six patients, but not in their throat swab and sputum samples. Their fecal samples remained positive up to 52 d. Conclusions: In the late convalescence, the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 patients gradually disappeared with the improvement of clinical symptoms. Moreover, the virus might enter the gastrointestinal tract from respiratory tract, and could long-term exist in recovered patients and be excreted in feces. In order to reduce the rate of missed detection and avoid false negative results, it was suggested to test the viral nucleic acid in different types of samples before a COVID-19 patient was discharged.

This study is a retrospective, single-center case series of the 238 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the First Hospital of Changsha city, China, from 01/21 to 02/14, 2020; the final date of follow-up was 02/27, 2020. Of 238 patients 43.7% visited Wuhan, 58.4% got in touch with Wuhan people, and 47.5% had contacted with diagnosed patients. 37.8% patients had family members infected. 190 cases had mild / general disease, and 48 cases had severe / critical disease. Compared to mild or general patients, more severe or critical patients visited Wuhan (59.6% vs 40.2%; P=0.02) and contacted with Wuhan people (74.5% vs 55.0%; P=0.02). All patients received antiviral treatment, including Lopinavir / Ritonavir (29.3%), Interferon (14.6%) and their combination (40.6%), Arbidol (6.7%), Xuebijing (7.1%) and Chloroquine phosphate (1.3%). Severe and critical patients received glucocorticoid, Gamma-globulin and oxygen inhalation. Some received mechanic ventilation support. As of 02/27, 161 patients discharged. The median length of hospital stay was 13 days. The 10-, 14-, 20- and 28-day discharge rate was 19.1%, 42.8%, 65.0% and 76.4%, respectively.

Before critical care becomes a necessity, identifying patients who are likely to become critically ill and providing prompt treatment is a strategy to avoid ICU oversaturation. There is a consensus that a hyperinflammatory syndrome or a ""cytokine storm""is responsible for poor outcomes in COVID-19. Measuring cytokine levels at the point of care is required in order to better understand this process. In this Perspective, we summarize the main events behind the cytokine storm in COVID-19 as well as current experimental treatments. We advocate for a new biosensor-enabled paradigm to personalize the management of COVID-19 and stratify patients. Biosensor-guided dosing and timing of immunomodulatory therapies could maximize the benefits of these anti-inflammatory treatments while minimizing deleterious effects. Biosensors will also be essential in order to detect complications such as coinfections and sepsis, which are common in immunosuppressed patients. Finally, we propose the ideal features of these biosensors using some prototypes from the recent literature as examples.

Although it is clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through human respiratory droplets and direct contact, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1–3. Here we investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding; this increase was possibly due to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"virus RNA; virus RNA; aerodynamics; aerosol; disease transmission; infectivity; particle settling; particle size; respiratory disease; sanitation; viral disease; aerosol; air conditioning; Article; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); disease transmission; epidemic; human; medical staff; priority journal; quarantine; room ventilation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface area; bathroom equipment; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; disinfection; genetics; hospital; intensive care unit; isolation and purification; mask; pandemic; patient; social isolation; virology; virus pneumonia; workplace; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Aerosols; Bathroom Equipment; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Crowding; Disinfection; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Masks; Medical Staff; Pandemics; Patients; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Social Isolation; Ventilation; Workplace","32340022","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084002242

But the reliability, reproducibility, and selectivity of majority of such diagnostic tests fail when they are tested either to a viral load at its early representation or to a viral gene mutated during its current spread. In this regard, a selective ""naked-eye""detection of SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable, which can be tested without accessing any advanced instrumental techniques. We herein report the development of a colorimetric assay based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), when capped with suitably designed thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific for N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, could be used for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within 10 min from the isolated RNA samples. The thiol-modified ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance. Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA-DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs. The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/μL of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of ""nanoimmunity by design""can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers.

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). Although this analysis represents patients with cardiac comorbidities (hypertension), the inclusion of biomarkers from other pathophysiologies implicated in COVID-19 (e.g., D-dimer for thrombotic events, CRP for infection or inflammation, and PCT for bacterial co-infection and sepsis) may improve future predictions for a more general population. These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data.

Countries take a series of stringent measures, including the prohibition of going out to prevent the virus that spreads COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we aimed to diagnose COVID-19 disease from X_RAY images by using deep learning architectures. In addition, 96.30% accuracy rate has been achieved with the hybrid architecture we have improved. While developing the hybrid model, the last 5 layers of Resnet 50 architecture were ejected. 10 layers were added in place of the 5 layers that were removed. The count of layers, which is 177 in the Resnet50 architecture, has been increased to 182 in the hybrid model. Thanks to these layer changes made in Resnet50, the accuracy rate has been increased more. Classification was performed with AlexNet, Resnet50, GoogLeNet, VGG16 and developed hybrid architectures using COVID-19 Chest X-Ray dataset and Chest X-Ray images (Pneumonia) dataseis. As a result, when other scientific works in the literature are examined, it is finalized that the improved hybrid method offers better results than other deep learning architectures and can be used in computer-aided systems to diagnose COVID-19 disease. © 2020 Lavoisier.

Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative.

First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across mainland China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal ‘risk source’ model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations.

The signals that lead to the production of extracellular ISG15 and the relationship between its two core functions remain unclear. We show that both epithelial cells and lymphocytes can secrete ISG15, which then signals in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to LFA-1-expressing cells. Microbial pathogens and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists result in both IFN-β-dependent and -independent secretion of ISG15, and residues required for ISG15 secretion are mapped. Intracellular ISGylation inhibits secretion, and viral effector proteins, influenza B NS1, and viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, have opposing effects on secretion of ISG15. These results establish extracellular ISG15 as a cytokine-like protein that bridges early innate and IFN-γ-dependent immune responses, and indicate that pathogens have evolved to differentially inhibit the intracellular and extracellular functions of ISG15. Swaim et al. characterize cell types and immune agonists that stimulate ISG15 secretion and signaling to lymphocytes. Intracellular conjugation of ISG15 is shown to inhibit secretion, whereas viral de-ISGylating enzymes, including SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, enhance ISG15 secretion, suggesting a potential role for ISG15 in pro-inflammatory responses associated with viral infections. © 2020 The Author(s)","ERVE Nairovirus vOTU; foot and mouth disease virus Lbpro; influenza B NS1; interferon-α/β; interferon-γ; ISG15; LFA-1; SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 PLpro; TLRs","beta interferon; cell protein; cytokine; ISG15 protein; lymphocyte function associated antigen 1; nonstructural protein 1; toll like receptor agonist; unclassified drug; viral effector protein; viral protein; virus enzyme; cytokine; G1p2 protein, mouse; gamma interferon; INS1 protein, influenza virus; ISG15 protein, human; pathogen associated molecular pattern; ubiquitin; viral protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; autocrine effect; cells by body anatomy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; epithelium cell; female; human; human cell; inflammation; Influenza B virus; innate immunity; lymphocyte; male; mouse; mutational analysis; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein secretion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; virus cell interaction; virus infection; animal; C57BL mouse; HEK293 cell line; immunology; influenza; Jurkat cell line; metabolism; mycobacteriosis; typhoid fever; Animals; Cytokines; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Influenza, Human; Interferon-gamma; Jurkat Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mycobacterium Infections; Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules; Signal Transduction; Typhoid Fever; Ubiquitins; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","32553163","Cell Rep.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086411366

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a respiratory illness with symptoms such as dry cough, fever, sudden loss of smell, and, in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. To date, there is no specific vaccine or treatment proven effective against this viral disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is thus critical to curbing its spread and improving health outcomes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly used to detect the presence of COVID-19. Other techniques, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and microfluidics, have allowed better disease diagnosis. Here, as part of the effort to expand screening capacity, we review advances and challenges in the rapid detection of COVID-19 by targeting nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies.

While fever, cough, and respiratory distress are typical first symptoms, a fraction of those affected present instead with neurological symptoms suggestive of central nervous system compromise. This review summarizes the potential contribution of coronavirus disease 2019 to hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly and proposes possible mechanisms. Reports show that the most affected patients have underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are two key risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the main host cell surface receptor interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein to allow viral entry and infection. We speculate that ensuing downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression may compound the risk conferred by pre-existing comorbidities and critically influence the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke by elevating blood pressure and impairing cerebrovascular endothelial function. Additionally, both age- and/or disease-related immune dysfunction and enhanced catecholamine release secondary to anxiety and stress may also aggravate central nervous system symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

The coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World Health Organization warning of a possible 'infodemic' of fake news. In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians, to the sale of face masks which may not necessarily protect the wearer. As we make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain will become an important part of quality control for public health communication and public discourse in general. © 2020 ACM.","Advertising; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Facebook; Messaging Campaign; Public Health","Biological weapons; Computation theory; Public health; Sustainable development; Viruses; Animal rights; Business promotions; Coronaviruses; Health communication; Internet users; Physical world; Social media platforms; World Health Organization; Social networking (online)",,"COMPASS - Proc.

Two  pharmacists joined the critical patient care to help the pharmacist who was  already integrated in the ICU team. The development of the operational  structure was carried out on three levels. The healthcare activity highlights the  daily participation of pharmacists in the two clinical sessions in which the ICU  teams evaluated all cases and made decisions. This in turn facilitated the  pharmaceutical validation that was carried out in the critical units themselves. In addition, one of the pharmacists created the Immuno-COVID Committee, in  which they participated together with different specialists for therapeutic  decision-making in the most complex cases. On the other hand, the availability  of human and material resources allowed the implantation of centralized  elaboration in the Pharmacy Service of many intravenous mixtures, including  antibiotics elastomers Pumps for continuous infusion, and non-sterile  elaborations. In logistics management, in addition to the acquisition of COVID- 19 therapies, the reconciliation with nursing activity stands out. The physical presence of the pharmacist favored the detection of needs, the  availability in time of medications in the unit, including sterile and non-sterile  preparations, and coordination with the central pharmacy. In knowledge  management, the participation of the pharmacist in the working group for the  development of the hospital management protocol COVID-19 stands out. The  daily presence in the unit and the joint work with the entire multidisciplinary team demonstrate the value that the pharmacist can bring. In addition to  efficient resource management, support for clinical decision-making and  improvement actions, it provides the climate of inter-professional trust necessary to respond to the complexity of the critical patient and promote joint  projects.

El objetivo de este trabajo es describir las actividades impulsadas por el farmacéutico en la atención del paciente crítico en este contexto. Se diseñó  una estructura organizativa nueva, analizando las tareas necesarias para  rentabilizar los procesos. Dos farmacéuticos se incorporaron a la atención del  paciente crítico para ayudar al farmacéutico que ya estaba integrado en el  equipo de la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos. El desarrollo de la estructura  operativa se llevó a cabo en tres niveles. En la actividad asistencial destaca la  participación diaria de los farmacéuticos en las dos sesiones clínicas en las que  los equipos de la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos valoraban todos los casos y  tomaban las decisiones. Esto, a su vez, facilitaba la validación farmacéutica que  se realizaba en las propias unidades de críticos. Además, uno de los  farmacéuticos ideó el Comité Inmuno-COVID, en el que participaban junto a  diferentes especialistas para la toma de decisiones terapéuticas en los casos más complejos. Por otro lado, la disponibilidad de recursos humanos y materiales  permitió implantar la elaboración de forma centralizada en el Servicio de Farmacia de muchas mezclas intravenosas, incluyendo elastómeros de  antibioterapia en perfusión continua, y de elaboraciones no estériles. En la  gestión logística, además de la adquisición de las terapias COVID-19, destaca la  conciliación con la actividad de enfermería. La presencia física del farmacéutico  favorecía la detección de necesidades, la disponibilidad en tiempo de  medicamentos en la unidad, incluyendo las elaboraciones estériles y no estériles, y la coordinación con la Farmacia central. En la gestión del conocimiento destaca la participación del farmacéutico en el grupo de trabajo para desarrollo del  protocolo hospitalario de manejo de la COVID-19. La presencia diaria en la  unidad y el trabajo conjunto con todo el equipo multidisciplinar ponen de  manifiesto el valor que el farmacéutico puede aportar.

Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds—including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds—as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"antivirus agent; c 145; carmofur; cinanserin; ebselen; n 3 complex; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; px 12; unclassified drug; 3C-like proteinase, Coronavirus; antivirus agent; cysteine proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; viral protein; antimicrobial activity; computer aided design; crystal structure; drug; enzyme activity; inhibitor; pneumonia; severe acute respiratory syndrome; vaccine; viral disease; antiviral activity; Article; complex formation; computer aided design; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug isolation; drug structure; drug targeting; high throughput screening; IC50; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Vero cell line; virus replication; virus transcription; Betacoronavirus; cell culture; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; drug design; drug development; drug effect; enzymology; human; molecular model; pandemic; preclinical study; procedures; protein tertiary structure; virology; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cells, Cultured; Coronavirus Infections; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Drug Design; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protease Inhibitors; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","32272481","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083768968

Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN–Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA–target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN–Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN–Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9–11. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"Cas13 protein; nucleic acid; unclassified drug; CRISPR associated protein; guide RNA; gene expression; genome; human immunodeficiency virus; influenza; mutation; nucleic acid; pathogen; public health; RNA; Article; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; combinatorial arrayed reactions for multiplexed evaluation of nucleic acid; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost minimization analysis; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; gene amplification; gene sequence; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; microorganism detection; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; priority journal; process development; RNA analysis; RNA replication; virus detection; virus genome; virus mutation; animal; antiviral resistance; Betacoronavirus; classification; CRISPR Cas system; devices; genetics; Influenza A virus; isolation and purification; metabolism; microfluidic analysis; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; virology; virus infection; Animals; Betacoronavirus; CRISPR-Associated Proteins; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Drug Resistance, Viral; Genome, Viral; HIV; Humans; Influenza A virus; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; RNA, Guide; Sensitivity and Specificity; Virus Diseases","32349121","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083978388

We conducted daily transcriptomic profiling of three COVID-19 cases and found that the early immune response in COVID-19 patients is highly dynamic. Patient throat swabs were tested daily for SARS-CoV-2, with the virus persisting for 3 to 4 weeks in all three patients. Cytokine analyses of whole blood revealed increased cytokine expression in the single most severe case. However, most inflammatory gene expression peaked after respiratory function nadir, except expression in the IL1 pathway. Parallel analyses of CD4 and CD8 expression suggested that the pro-inflammatory response may be intertwined with T cell activation that could exacerbate disease or prolong the infection. Collectively, these findings hint at the possibility that IL1 and related pro-inflammatory pathways may be prognostic and serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.

As a result, the public health and clinical community are hindered in their ability to monitor and contain the spread of COVID-19. Despite broad consensus that more testing is needed, pragmatic guidance toward realizing this objective has been limited. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel and geographically agnostic framework (the 4Ps framework) to guide multidisciplinary, scalable, resource-efficient, and achievable efforts toward enhanced testing capacity. The 4Ps (Prioritize, Propagate, Partition, and Provide) are described in terms of specific opportunities to enhance the volume, diversity, characterization, and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 testing to benefit public health. Coordinated deployment of the strategic and tactical recommendations described in this framework has the potential to rapidly expand available testing capacity, improve public health decision-making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or to be applied in future emergent disease outbreaks. © 2020 The Authors.

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 worldwide, highlights the critical need for developing rapid and accurate diagnostic testing methods for emerging human coronavirus (CoV) infections. Testing is crucial to track the spread of disease during a pandemic, and to swiftly permit public health interventions including isolation, quarantine, and appropriate clinical management of afflicted individuals. The key components of viral diagnostic tests are (1) collection of the appropriate sample (blood, nasal swab, and throat swab), (2) availability of the genetic and proteomic sequences of the novel virus for analysis, and (3) rapid and accurate laboratory testing methods. The current gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viral nucleic acids. Other relevant laboratory methods include enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for viral antibody and antigen detection, and serum viral neutralization (SVN) assays for antibody neutralization determination. The challenges faced in developing a diagnostic test for a novel pathogen are the ability to measure low viral loads for early detection, to provide low or no cross-reactivity with other viral strains and to deliver results rapidly. Several point-of-care molecular devices are currently being integrated for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

With the fast-response experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently. Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro's pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes. By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called ""anchor""site. Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro's inhibitors with a high binding affinity.

Using a mouse model, we determined whether cells in the olfactory epithelium express the obligatory receptors for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by using RNAseq, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons. These data suggest that sustentacular cells are involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and impairment of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 exhibits a strong human-to-human transmission infectivity and could cause acute respiratory diseases. Asymptomatic carriers are able to infect other healthy persons, and this poses a challenge for public health; the World Health Organization (WHO) has already announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Nucleic acid testing, considered as the current primary method for diagnosing COVID-19, might lead to false negatives and is difficult to be applied for every suspected patient because of the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Meanwhile, detecting specific antibodies in blood, such as the IgM antibody, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is another choice for COVID-19 diagnosis, as it is widely accepted that IgM is an important indicator in the acute infection period. In this study, a colloidal gold nanoparticle-based lateral-flow (AuNP-LF) assay was developed to achieve rapid diagnosis and on-site detection of the IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the indirect immunochromatography method. For preparing AuNP-LF strips, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 NP) was coated on an analytical membrane for sample capture, and antihuman IgM was conjugated with AuNPs to form the detecting reporter. Optimization of AuNP-LF assay was carried out by altering the pH value and the amount of antihuman IgM. The performance of AuNP-LF assay was evaluated by testing serum samples of COVID-19 patients and normal humans. The results were compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of AuNP-LF assay were determined to be 100 and 93.3%, respectively, and an almost perfect agreement was exhibited by Kappa statistics (κ coefficient = 0.872). AuNP-LF assay showed outstanding selectivity in the detection of IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 virus with no interference from other viruses such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and dengue virus (DFV). AuNP-LF assay was able to achieve results within 15 min and needed only 10-20 μL serum for each test. As a whole, in the light of its advantages such as excellent specificity and stability, easy operation, low cost, and being less time-consuming, AuNP-LF assay is a feasible method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary hospitals and laboratories, especially in emergency situations in which numerous samples need to be tested on time. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,"ACS Omega",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085772370

Disinfection and hygiene are two integral parts of any safe indoor environment, and these factors become more critical in COVID-19-like pandemic situations. Door handles are highly sensitive contact points that are prone to be contamination. Automation of the door-handle cleaning task is not only important for ensuring safety, but also to improve efficiency. This work proposes an AI-enabled framework for automating cleaning tasks through a Human Support Robot (HSR). The overall cleaning process involves mobile base motion, door-handle detection, and control of the HSR manipulator for the completion of the cleaning tasks. The detection part exploits a deep-learning technique to classify the image space, and provides a set of coordinates for the robot. The cooperative control between the spraying and wiping is developed in the Robotic Operating System. The control module uses the information obtained from the detection module to generate a task/operational space for the robot, along with evaluating the desired position to actuate the manipulators. The complete strategy is validated through numerical simulations, and experiments on a Toyota HSR platform. © 2020 by the authors.

While SARS-CoV-2 titers can be measured by detection of viral nucleic acid, this method is unable to quantitate infectious virions. Measurement of infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by tissue culture infectious dose−50 (TCID50), which detects the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in cells infected with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. However, this method only provides a qualitative infectious virus titer. Plaque assays are a quantitative method of measuring infectious SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying the plaques formed in cell culture upon infection with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. As such, plaque assays remain the gold standard in quantifying concentrations of replication-competent lytic virions. Here, we describe two detailed plaque assay protocols to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 using different overlay and staining methods. Both methods have several advantages and disadvantages, which can be considered when choosing the procedure best suited for each laboratory. These assays can be used for several research purposes, including titration of virus stocks produced from infected cell supernatant and, with further optimization, quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from infected animals. © 2019 The Authors.

This study hypothesized that IFR would be influenced by COVID-19 epidemic intensity. We tested the association between epidemic intensity and IFR using serological results from a recent large SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey (N = 60,983) in 19 Spanish regions. The infection fatality rate for Spain as a whole was 1.15% and varied between 0.13% and 3.25% in the regions (median 1.07%, IQR 0.69–1.32%). The IFR by region was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (rho = 0.54; p = 0.0162), cases/100,000 (rho = 0.75; p = 0.002), hospitalizations/100,000 (rho = 0.78; p = 0.0001), mortality/100,000 (rho = 0.77; p = 0.0001) and case fatality rate (rho = 0.49; p = 0.0327). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 IFR is not fixed. The Spanish regions with more rapid and extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 had higher IFRs. These findings are compatible with the theory that slowing the spread of COVID-19 down reduces the IFR and case fatality rate via preventing hospitals from being overrun, and thus allowing better and lifesaving care. © 2020 by the author.

Early COVID-19 detection among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for protecting patients and the healthcare workforce. Because of limited testing capacity, symptom-based screening may prioritize testing and increase diagnostic accuracy. Methods and findings We performed a retrospective study of HCWs undergoing both COVID-19 telephonic symptom screening and nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 assays during the period, March 9.April 15, 2020. HCWs with negative assays but progressive symptoms were re-tested for SARSCoV- 2. Among 592 HCWs tested, 83 (14%) had an initial positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Fiftynine of 61 HCWs (97%) who were asymptomatic or reported only sore throat/nasal congestion had negative SARS-CoV-2 assays (P = 0.006). HCWs reporting three or more symptoms had an increased multivariate-adjusted odds of having positive assays, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.10.3.64), which increased to 2.61 (95% CI: 1.50.4.45) for six or more symptoms. The multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive assay were also increased for HCWs reporting fever and a measured temperature . 37.5°C (3.49 (95% CI: 1.95.6.21)), and those with myalgias (1.83 (95% CI: 1.04.3.23)). Anosmia/ageusia (i.e. loss of smell/loss of taste) was reported less frequently (16%) than other symptoms by HCWs with positive assays, but was associated with more than a seven-fold multivariate-adjusted odds of a positive test: OR = 7.21 (95% CI: 2.95.17.67). Of 509 HCWs with initial negative SARS-CoV-2 assays, nine had symptom progression and positive re-tests, yielding an estimated negative predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI: 96.8-99.0%) for the exclusion of clinically relevant COVID-19. Conclusions Symptom and temperature reports are useful screening tools for predicting SARS-CoV-2 assay results in HCWs. Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia were the strongest independent predictors of positive assays. The absence of symptoms or symptoms limited to nasal congestion/sore throat were associated with negative assays. © 2020 Lan et al.",,"adult; ageusia; anosmia; Article; asymptomatic infection; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; dyspnea; female; fever; headache; health care personnel; human; major clinical study; malaise; male; myalgia; nausea; nose obstruction; nose smear; predictive value; rash; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; rhinorrhea; screening test; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sinusitis; sneezing; sore throat; symptom; telephone interview; throat culture; vomiting; asymptomatic infection; Betacoronavirus; body temperature; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; middle aged; multivariate analysis; nasopharynx; pandemic; pathophysiology; pharyngitis; polymerase chain reaction; principal component analysis; smelling disorder; statistical model; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Ageusia; Asymptomatic Infections; Betacoronavirus; Body Temperature; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Fever; Health Personnel; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Myalgia; Nasopharynx; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pharyngitis; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Principal Component Analysis; Retrospective Studies","32589687","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087320333

Serological assays are urgently needed to conduct serosurveys, to understand the antibody responses mounted in response to the virus, and to identify individuals who are potentially immune to re-infection.

Meanwhile, increased demand for testing has led to a shortage of reagents and supplies and compromised the performance of diagnostic laboratories in many countries. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend multi-step RT-PCR assays using multiple primer and probe pairs, which might complicate the interpretation of the test results, especially for borderline cases. In this study, we describe an alternative RT-PCR approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be used for the probe-based detection of clinical isolates in diagnostics as well as in research labs using a low-cost SYBR green method. For the evaluation, we used samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and performed RT-PCR assays along with successive dilutions of RNA standards to determine the limit of detection. We identified an M-gene binding primer and probe pair highly suitable for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for diagnostic and research purposes. © 2020 by the authors.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in 30-45 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic sequence. RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from actual COVID-19 patients was also tested. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 in both simulated patient samples and clinical specimens. This test was performed in 30-45 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.

While we were able to identify the causative agent within a few days of the disease outbreak, several questions still remain unanswered. In this review, we discuss the extent of virus spread, current statistics, SARS-CoV-2 genome organization, comparison between the novel coronavirus and causative agents involved in previous outbreaks, ongoing clinical trials and myths associated with the virus. Lastly, we provide insights into the future perspectives which could prove useful for the scientific community as they work on finding the cure against the disease. Impact statement: Early availability of the sequence, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), has prompted efforts towards identifying a safe and effective vaccine in the current public health emergency. To that end, understanding the pathophysiology of disease is crucial for scientists around the world. Since conventional vaccine development and manufacturing may take several years, it is important to think about alternative strategies that we could use to mitigate imminent catastrophe.

The emerging virus, SARS-CoV-2, causes coughing, fever, muscle ache, and shortness of breath or dyspnea in symptomatic patients. The pathogenic particles that are generated by coughing and sneezing remain suspended in the air or attach to a surface to facilitate transmission in an aerosol form. This review focuses on the recent trends in pandemic biology, diagnostics methods, prevention tools, and policies for COVID-19 management. To meet the growing demand for medical supplies during the COVID-19 era, a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators have been developed using do-it-yourself (DIY) manufacturing. COVID-19 diagnosis and the prediction of virus transmission are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, simulations, and digital monitoring. Until the discovery of a clinically approved vaccine for COVID-19, pandemics remain a public concern. Therefore, technological developments, biomedical research, and policy development are needed to decipher the coronavirus mechanism and epidemiological characteristics, prevent transmission, and develop therapeutic drugs. © 2020 by the authors.

The potential pre-miRNAs were identified by ViralMir and mature miRNAs were recognized by Mature Bayes. Additionally, predicted mature miRNAs were analysed against human genome by miRDB server to retrieve target genes. Besides that we also retrieved GO (Gene Ontology) terms for pathways, functions and cellular components. We predicted 26 mature miRNAs from genome of SARS-CoV-2 that targets human genes involved in pathways like EGF receptor signaling, apoptosis signaling, VEGF signaling, FGF receptor signaling.

We herewith report the proof-of-concept development of a biosensor able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus. The biosensor is based on membrane-engineered mammalian cells bearing the human chimeric spike S1 antibody. We demonstrate that the attachment of the protein to the membrane-bound antibodies resulted in a selective and considerable change in the cellular bioelectric properties measured by means of a Bioelectric Recognition Assay. The novel biosensor provided results in an ultra-rapid manner (3 min), with a detection limit of 1 fg/mL and a semi-linear range of response between 10 fg and 1 µg/mL. In addition, no cross-reactivity was observed against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the biosensor was configured as a ready-to-use platform, including a portable read-out device operated via smartphone/tablet.

Nanomaterials comprising functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) and quantum dots and nanotechnology-associated innovative detection methods, vaccine design, and nanodrug production have shown immense promise for interfacing with pathogenic viruses and restricting their entrance into cells. These viruses have been scrutinized using rapid diagnostic detection and therapeutic interventional options against the caused infections including vaccine development for prevention and control. Coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have endangered human life, and the COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has become a perilous challenge to public health globally with huge accompanying morbidity rates. Thus, it is imperative to expedite the drug and vaccine development efforts that would help mitigate this pandemic. In this regard, smart and innovative nano-based technologies and approaches encompassing applications of green nanomedicine, bio-inspired methods, multifunctional bioengineered nanomaterials, and biomimetic drug delivery systems/carriers can help resolve the critical issues regarding detection, prevention, and treatment of viral infections.

Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients.

Due to various symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, there is a pressing need for a fast and sensitive detection protocol to diagnose asymptomatic people. Various SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits are already available from many companies and national health agencies. However, publicly available information on these diagnostic kits is lacking. In response to the growing need and the lack of information, we developed and made available a low-cost, easy-access, real-time PCR-based protocol for the early detection of the virus in a previous study. During the development of the detection protocol, we found that unoptimized primer sets could inadvertently show false-positive results, raising the possibility that commercially available diagnostic kits might also contain primer sets that produce false-positive results. Here, we provide three-step guidelines for the design and optimization of specific primer sets. The three steps include (1) the selection of primer sets for target genes (RdRP, N, E, and S) in the genome of interest (SARS-CoV-2), (2) the in silico validation of primer and amplicon sequences, and (3) the optimization of PCR conditions (i.e., primer concentrations and annealing temperatures) for specific hybridization between the primers and target genes, and the elimination of spurious primer dimers. Furthermore, we have expanded the previously developed real-time PCR-based protocol to more conventional PCR-based protocols and applied a multiplex PCR-based protocol that allows the simultaneous testing of primer sets for RdRP, N, E, and S all in one reaction. Our newly optimized protocol should be helpful for the large-scale, high-fidelity screening of asymptomatic people, even without any high-specification equipment, for the further prevention of transmission, and to achieve early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"amplicon; Article; clinical protocol; computer model; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; early diagnosis; early intervention; false positive result; gene targeting; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; hybridization; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; polymerase chain reaction; practice guideline; process optimization; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; temperature; throat culture; virus detection; virus genome; virus transmission; volunteer; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; laboratory technique; pandemic; pharynx; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; SARS coronavirus; virology; virus pneumonia; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; primer DNA; RNA directed RNA polymerase; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, coronavirus; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; viral protein; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; DNA Primers; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Replicase; SARS Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Viral Proteins","32546849","Exp.

To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW™ COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min. More so, isothermal platforms are cost effective and could easily be scaled up to resource limited settings.

Nrf2 activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2-activating composition PB125® downregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, we report the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-α, the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN-γ-induced genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the “cytokine storm” observed in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity of the storm. © 2020 by the authors.

Aquatic environments, lakes, rivers and ponds, are important habitats for bats and birds, which are hosts for various coronavirus species and strains and which shed viral particles in their feces. It is therefore of high interest to fully explore the role that aquatic environments may play in coronavirus spread, including cross-species transmissions. Besides the respiratory tract, coronaviruses pathogenic to humans can also infect the digestive system and be subsequently defecated. Considering this, it is pivotal to understand whether wastewater can play a role in their dissemination, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. This review provides an overview of the taxonomy, molecular biology, natural reservoirs and pathogenicity of coronaviruses; outlines their potential to survive in aquatic environments and wastewater; and demonstrates their association with aquatic biota, mainly waterfowl. It also calls for further, interdisciplinary research in the field of aquatic virology to explore the potential hotspots of coronaviruses in the aquatic environment and the routes through which they may enter it. © 2020 by the authors.","Aquatic environment; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; Emerging infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2; Viral infection; Wastewater; Zoonosis","Digestive system; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Viruses; Aquatic environments; Coronaviruses; Interdisciplinary research; Research interests; Respiratory tract; Scientific community; Single stranded RNA; Viral particles; Diseases; aquatic environment; digestive system; epidemic; molecular analysis; pathogenicity; respiratory disease; taxonomy; virus; wastewater; water chemistry; Anatidae; Aves; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; RNA viruses; SARS coronavirus",,"Water",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087527185

The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period. The current COVID-19 outbreak brings the need to develop tools and methods to support businesses and institutions in the use of SNA for preventing outbreaks among their employees. Although some literature does exist in the field of SNA application in epidemiology, its adaptation for extensive use by the Occupational and Health Services is still a challenge. © 2020 by the authors.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Decision making; Epidemiology; Infection prevention; Job shift; Preventive measures; Protection; Public health; Risk; SARS-COV-2; Social network analysis; Workers","adaptation; business; cohesion; decision making; health and safety; health risk; occupational exposure; prioritization; risk factor; safety; social network; virus; Coronavirus",,"Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086414854

The most common features are purported to be fever and a new persistent cough, although the global prevalence of these symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the prevalence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 worldwide. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, medRxiv and bioRxiv on 5th April 2020 for studies of adults (>16 years) with laboratory test confirmed COVID-19. No language or publication status restrictions were applied. Data were independently extracted by two review authors into standardised forms. All datapoints were independently checked by three other review authors. A random-effects model for pooling of binomial data was applied to estimate the prevalence of symptoms, subgrouping estimates by country. I2 was used to assess inter-study heterogeneity. Results: Of 851 unique citations, 148 articles were included which comprised 24,410 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from 9 countries. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (78% [95% CI 75%-81%]; 138 studies, 21,701 patients; I2 94%), a cough (57% [95% CI 54%-60%]; 138 studies, 21,682 patients; I2 94%) and fatigue (31% [95% CI 27%-35%]; 78 studies, 13,385 patients; I2 95%). Overall, 19% of hospitalised patients required non-invasive ventilation (44 studies, 6,513 patients), 17% required intensive care (33 studies, 7504 patients), 9% required invasive ventilation (45 studies, 6933 patients) and 2% required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (12 studies, 1,486 patients). The mortality rate was 7% (73 studies, 10,402 patients). Conclusions: We confirm that fever and cough are the most prevalent symptoms of adults infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a large proportion of infected adults which symptomsalone do not identify. © 2020 Grant et al.

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; RNA directed RNA polymerase; Article; basic reproduction number; case fatality rate; contact examination; control strategy; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; government; human; hygiene; infection control; Italy; model; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; computer simulation; Coronavirus infection; female; male; pandemic; pathogenicity; quarantine; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine","32322102","Nat.

Leading public health experts have recommended that this should be tried in a demonstration project in which a medium-sized city introduces weekly testing and lifts lockdown completely. The idea was not considered by the groups whose predictions have guided UK policy, so we have examined the statistical case for such a study. The combination of regular testing with strict household quarantine, which was not analysed in their models, has remarkable power to reduce transmission to the community from other household members as well as providing earlier diagnosis and facilitating rapid contact tracing. © 2020 The Authors.","COVID-19; quarantine; screening",,,"R.

RNA editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter virus infection, but it is not yet known whether this process operates against coronaviruses. Here, we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from coronavirus-infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: adenosine-to-inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from APOBEC deaminases. Mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of Coronaviridae from human hosts reveals mutational patterns consistent with those observed in the transcriptomic data. However, the reduced ADAR signature in these data raises the possibility that ADARs might be more effective than APOBECs in restricting viral propagation. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient. © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (−2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36–45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects. © 2020 by the authors.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the frequent organ damage in severe COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that human renal tubule cells could be the potential host cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Traditional cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines are genetically and phenotypically different from host cells. Animal models are widely used, but often fail to reflect a physiological and pathogenic status because of species tropisms. There is an unmet need for normal human epithelial cells for disease modeling. In this study, we successfully established long term cultures of normal human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and organoids techniques. These cells had the ability to differentiate and repair DNA damage, and showed no transforming property. Importantly, the CR KPTECs maintained lineage function with expression of specific transporters (SLC34A3 and cubilin). They also expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cancer cell line did not express endogenous SLC34A3, cubilin and ACE2. Very interestingly, ACE2 expression was around twofold higher in 3D organoids culture compared to that in 2D CR culture condition. Pseudovirion assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein was able to enter CR cells with luciferase reporter. This integrated 2D CR and 3D organoid cultures provide a physiological ex vivo model to study kidney functions, innate immune response of kidney cells to viruses, and a novel platform for drug discovery and safety evaluation. © 2020, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); Conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs); Kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs); Organoids; SARS-CoVs","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cubilin; sodium phosphate cotransporter 2c; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cell surface receptor; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; intrinsic factor-cobalamin receptor; SLC34A3 protein, human; sodium phosphate cotransporter 2c; acute kidney failure; Article; cell culture; cell lineage; coronavirus disease 2019; DNA repair; ex vivo study; gene expression; host cell; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; innate immunity; kidney epithelium; kidney proximal tubule; kidney tubule cell; nuclear reprogramming; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal; Betacoronavirus; cell culture technique; cell line; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; disease model; DNA damage; epithelium cell; kidney; metabolism; organoid; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; DNA Damage; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Kidney; Organoids; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Cell Surface; SARS Virus; Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type IIc; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","32602046","Virol.

Coronaviruses are generally transferred by people and many diverse species of animals, including birds and mammals such as cattle, camels, cats, and bats. Infrequently, the coronavirus can be transferred from animals to humans, and then propagate among people, such as with “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)”, “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)”, and now with this new virus, namely “SARS-CoV-2”, or human coronavirus. Its rapid spreading has sent billions of people into lockdown as health services struggle to cope up. The COVID-19 outbreak comes along with an exponential growth of new infections, as well as a growing death count. A major goal to limit the further exponential spreading is to slow down the transmission rate, which is denoted by a “spread factor (f)”, and we proposed an algorithm in this study for analyzing the same. This paper addresses the potential of data science to assess the risk factors correlated with COVID-19, after analyzing existing datasets available in “ourworldindata.org (Oxford University database)”, and newly simulated datasets, following the analysis of different univariate “Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)” models for forecasting new cases and resulting deaths. The result shows that vanilla, stacked, and bidirectional LSTM models outperformed multilayer LSTM models. Besides, we discuss the findings related to the statistical analysis on simulated datasets. For correlation analysis, we included features, such as external temperature, rainfall, sunshine, population, infected cases, death, country, population, area, and population density of the past three months - January, February, and March in 2020.

In this pandemic situation, health systems have been put under stress, and the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) exceeded the delivery capabilities of suppliers. To address this issue, 3D printing was identified as a possible solution to quickly produce PPE items such as face shields, mask straps, masks, valves, and ear savers. Around the world, companies, universities, research institutions, and private individuals/hobbyists stepped into the void, using their 3D printers to support hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, and even refugee camps by providing them with PPE. In Germany, the makervsvirus movement took up the challenge and connected thousands of end users, makers, companies, and logistic providers for the production and supply of face shields, protective masks, and ear savers. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) also joined the makervsvirus movement and used its facilities to print headbands for face shield assemblies and ear savers. Within this paper, the challenges and lessons learned from the quick ramp up of a research laboratory to a production site for medium-sized batches of PPE, the limitations in material supply, selection criteria for suitable models, quality measures, and future prospects are reported and conclusions drawn. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; Customized mass production; Makervsvirus; Pandemic; 3D FFF printing; Personal protective equipment (PPE); Quality assessment; Zero lead-time",,,"Appl.

Assertions in the literature suggest that respiratory disorders due to COVID-19 commonly present with pneumonia-like symptoms which are radiologically confirmed as opacities. Radiology serves as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. While computed tomography (CT) imaging is more specific than chest X-rays (CXR), its use is limited due to cross-contamination concerns. CXR imaging is commonly used in high-demand situations, placing a significant burden on radiology services. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested to alleviate this burden. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based AI tools. We propose increasing training data for recognizing COVID-19 pneumonia opacities using weakly labeled data augmentation. This follows from a hypothesis that the COVID-19 manifestation would be similar to that caused by other viral pathogens affecting the lungs. We expand the training data distribution for supervised learning through the use of weakly labeled CXR images, automatically pooled from publicly available pneumonia datasets, to classify them into those with bacterial or viral pneumonia opacities. Next, we use these selected images in a stage-wise, strategic approach to train convolutional neural network-based algorithms and compare against those trained with nonaugmented data. Weakly labeled data augmentation expands the learned feature space in an attempt to encompass variability in unseen test distributions, enhance inter-class discrimination, and reduce the generalization error. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that simple weakly labeled data augmentation (Acc: 0.5555 and Acc: 0.6536) is better than baseline non-augmented training (Acc: 0.2885 and Acc: 0.5028) in identifying COVID-19 manifestations as viral pneumonia. Interestingly, adding COVID-19 CXRs to simple weakly labeled augmented training data significantly improves the performance (Acc: 0.7095 and Acc: 0.8889), suggesting that COVID-19, though viral in origin, creates a uniquely different presentation in CXRs compared with other viral pneumonia manifestations. © 2020 by the authors.

NAD+ is an essential coenzyme that plays important roles in various metabolic pathways and increasing its overall content has been confirmed as a valuable strategy for treating a wide variety of pathophysiological conditions. Accumulating evidence on NRs’ health benefits has validated its efficiency across numerous animal and human studies for the treatment of a number of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic disorders. As the prevalence and morbidity of these conditions increases in modern society, the great necessity has arisen for a rapid translation of NR to therapeutic use and further establishment of its availability as a nutritional supplement. Here, we summarize currently available data on NR effects on metabolism, and several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, through to its application as a treatment for specific pathophysiological conditions. In addition, we have reviewed newly published research on the application of NR as a potential therapy against infections with several pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, to support rapid NR translation to therapeutics, the challenges related to its bioavailability and safety are addressed, together with the advantages of NR to other NAD+ precursors. © 2020 by the authors.

The other 62 referenced papers were of different types (eg, reviews, WHO protocols, letter to editor etc). Study selection The study selected trials, reviews, and in-vitro research assessing the critical aspects of saliva as an easily accessible and early-stage diagnostic source, and also an entry route for 2019-nCoV. Most of the clinical studies were descriptive case series of patients who had contracted 2019-nCoV in China. These were mainly studies designed to compare saliva samples with throat swabs, with regard to the presence of 2019-nCoV RNA. Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers. Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV. Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts. Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence. © 2020, British Dental Association.",,"Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; saliva; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Saliva","32591666","Evid.-based Dent.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086869851

Methods and results All adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection in two Italian provinces were followed for a median of 24 days. ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD). The youngest deceased person aged 44 years. Among hypertensive subjects (n = 543), the proportion of those treated with ARBs or ACEi were 88.4%, 78.7% and 80.6% among patients with mild, severe and very severe/lethal disease, respectively. At multivariate analysis, no association was observed between therapy and disease severity (Adjusted OR for very severe/lethal COVID-19: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.50–1.49). Significant predictors of severe disease were older age (with AORs largely increasing after 70 years of age), male gender (AOR: 1.76; 1.40–2.23), diabetes (AOR: 1.52; 1.05–2.18), CVD (AOR: 1.88; 1.32–2.70) and COPD (AOR: 1.88; 1.11–3.20). Only gender, age and diabetes also predicted very severe/lethal disease. Conclusion No association was found between COVID-19 severity and treatment with ARBs and/or ACEi, supporting the recommendation to continue medication for all patients unless otherwise advised by their physicians. © 2020 Bravi et al.

X-ray imaging, although limited to specific visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. In this study, the problem of automatic classification of pulmonary diseases, including the recently emerged COVID-19, from X-ray images, is considered. Methods: Deep Learning has proven to be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases, is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve excellent results in related tasks. Results: Training the CNNs from scratch outperforms the other transfer learning techniques, both in distinguishing the X-rays between the seven classes and between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19. A classification accuracy between the seven classes of 87.66% is achieved. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

Case Report: Clinical and radiographic data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and evaluated for COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration-approved reverse transcription-PCR assays. On radiographic examination, PET/CT was consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia not seen on prior imaging. Initial nasopharyngeal swab 2 days after PET/CT imaging was negative for COVID-19. Subsequent repeat swab 10 days later was positive for COVID-19, while the patient was febrile on screening assessment. The patient remained COVID-19-positive until 1 month after abnormal PET/CT imaging. Conclusion: PET/CT can be sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in the setting of a negative confirmatory PCR test.

Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment, and researchers around the world are attempting to fight the infection. In this paper, we consider a diagnosis method for COVID-19, which is characterized by a very rapid rate of infection and is widespread. A possible method for avoiding severe infections is to stop the spread of the infection in advance by the prompt and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. To this end, we exploit a group testing (GT) scheme, which is used to find a small set of confirmed cases out of a large population. For the accurate detection of false positives and negatives, we propose a robust algorithm (RA) based on the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). The key idea of the proposed RA is to exploit iterative detection to propagate beliefs to neighbor nodes by exchanging marginal probabilities between input and output nodes. As a result, we show that our proposed RA provides the benefit of being robust against noise in the GT schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the performance of our proposal with a number of tests and successfully find a set of infected samples in both noiseless and noisy GT schemes with different COVID-19 incidence rates. © 2020 by the author.

Based on the hypothesis of model, the population was divided into the susceptible individual, explored individual, infected individual and removed individual. According to the spreading characteristics of COVID-19, the modified susceptible-explored-infected-removed (SEIR) and susceptible-explored-infected (SEI) spreading dynamics equations of COVID-19 of epidemic area, port, station, car, ship and related area were established under the influence of traffic and transportation. Based on the analysis of spread process of COVID-19 by traffic and transportation, a causal loop of the system dynamics model of traffic and transportation spreading the COVID-19 was drawn, and a causality feedback loop was analyzed. The model of COVID-19 spreaded by traffic and transportation was established based on the system dynamics, and the dimensional consistency, mechanical error, model validity, and extreme condition of the model were tested. Taking the City A as the research example, the influence of traffic and transportation on the spread of COVID-19 was researched by establishing three simulation scenarios. Simulation result shows that the number of individuals infected with the COVID-19 in City A reaches a peak on the 32nd day after the outbreak, and 77 726 people were infected, and that of the area outside the City A reaches the peak on the 30th day after the outbreak, and 28 084 people were infected. The traffic and transportation have positive feedback effects on the spread of COVID-19. The peak volumes of infected and removed individuals of COVID-19 under the influence of traffic and transportation are 18.62 and 10.99 times of those without the participation of traffic and transportation, respectively. Therefore, the traffic control measures have a positive effect on controlling the development and preventing the spread of COVID-19. The increase of public transport proportion will accelerate the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, reducing people's travel demands and the proportion of public transport, and increasing the virus elimination work of public transportation car, ship, port and station can effectively slow down the spread of COVID-19. 1 tab, 12 figs, 30 refs. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

Although previous studies have described the clinical aspects of COVID-19, few studies have focused on the early detection of severe COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of severe COVID-19 and to compare clinical features between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with less severe COVID-19. Patients admitted to designated hospital in the Henan Province of China who were either discharged or died prior to February 15, 2020 were enrolled retrospectively. Additionally, patients who underwent at least one of the following treatments were assigned to the severe group: continuous renal replacement therapy, high-flow oxygen absorption, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The remaining patients were assigned to the non-severe group. Demographic information, initial symptoms, and first visit examination results were collected from the electronic medical records and compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of severe COVID-19. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify a threshold for each predictor. Altogether,104 patients were enrolled in our study with 30 and 74 patients in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that patients aged ≥63 years (odds ratio = 41.0; 95% CI: 2.8, 592.4), with an absolute lymphocyte value of ≥1.02×109/L (odds ratio = 6.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 25.2) and a C-reactive protein level of ≥65.08mg/L (odds ratio = 8.9; 95% CI = 1.0, 74.2) were at a higher risk of severe illness.

Many studies have dealt with the prediction of the evolution of cases affected by the C'OVID-19 virus. Given the unreliability of the data collected about the number of new cases and the uncertainties in values, the results found cannot be accurate and present a bias. In this paper, we will present a study using artificial intelligence algorithms more precisely machine and deep learning algorithms to predict the evolution of cases reached by COVID-19 in the future given the application of confinement and the use of protection tools. To improve the accuracy of the results and to take into account the uncertain aspect of the data we will apply the theory of belief functions. Among objectives of this theory is the fusion of different sources of information, given by artificial intelligence algorithms in our case, in order to obtain a global knowledge in the form of a more precise and reinforced belief function. Results shows that applying the home isolation and the use of protection tools with the rate over of 80% can reduce considerably the number of cases. © 2020 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Based on the data of 154 individuals from 26 provinces, age remained a key mortality risk factor among geriatric patients of different ages. While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. Against mixed results, more research should be done on identifying comorbidities associated with mortality in geriatric patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Elderly; Geriatric patients; Mortality; Risk factors","aged; body temperature; China; Chinese; clinical feature; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; dyspnea; fatality; female; fever; geriatric patient; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality risk; pneumonia; priority journal; Review; risk factor; thorax pain; very elderly; complication; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; mortality; pandemic; predictive value; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors","32353398","Mech.

Several hypotheses have been drawn up to understand the role of the interaction between the infectious agent and the immune system in the development of the disease and the most severe forms; the role of the cytokine storm seems important. Innate immunity, as one of the first elements of guest interaction with different infectious agents, could play an important role in the development of the cytokine storm and be responsible for boosting more severe forms. Therefore, it seems important to study also this important arm of the immune system to adequately understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

The respective study is based on quantitative data analysis of the responses of 300 social media users across India, collected online in April 2020 during nationwide lockdown.The study arrived at a conclusion stating that self-regulation may not deliver a proper effect on controlling the spread of fake news. But, organising effective campaigns to build social media literacy can be one of the potential measures that can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news over social media platforms. The respondents of the study also agree to bring-in a national policy and a national regulatory body to control the spread of fake news over social media platforms.

Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"antivirus agent; virus vaccine; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; combination drug therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug approval; drug development; drug efficacy; drug quality; drug repositioning; drug research; drug safety; Editorial; European Medicines Agency; genotoxicity; investment; new (animal free) approach method; priority journal; quality control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal testing alternative; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug development; human; pandemic; preclinical study; procedures; virus pneumonia; Animal Testing Alternatives; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Development; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines","32447523","Arch.

To ensure reliable smartphone-based healthcare interfaces with high levels of efficacy, a system dynamics model with sustainability indicators is proposed. The focus of this paper is smartphone-based breathing monitoring systems that could possibly use breathing sounds as the data acquisition input. This can especially be useful for the self-testing procedure of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis in which the lungs are attacked and breathing is affected. The method of investigation is based on a systems engineering approach using system dynamics modeling. In this paper, first, a causal model for a smartphone-based respiratory function monitoring is introduced. Then, a systems thinking approach is applied to propose a system dynamics model of the smartphone-based respiratory function monitoring system. The system dynamics model investigates the level of efficacy and sustainability of the system by studying the behavior of various factors of the system including patient wellbeing and care, cost, convenience, user friendliness, in addition to other embedded software and hardware breathing monitoring system design and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, real-time response, etc.). The sustainability level is also studied through introducing various indicators that directly relate to the three pillars of sustainability. Various scenarios have been applied and tested on the proposed model. The results depict the dynamics of the model for the efficacy and sustainability of smartphone-based breathing monitoring systems. The proposed ideas provide a clear insight to envision sustainable and effective smartphone-based healthcare monitoring systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Modeling; Respiration; Sustainability; System dynamics; Systems engineering","assessment method; hardware; health care; mobile phone; monitoring system; respiratory disease; software; sustainability; virus",,"Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086941400

For this reason, the volatilities of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and Dubai crude daily oil price data between 29 May 2006 and 31 March 2020 are analysed. Firstly, the presence of chaotic and nonlinear behaviour in the oil prices during the pandemic and the concurrent conflict is investigated by using the Shanon Entropy and Lyapunov exponent tests. The tests show that the oil prices exhibit chaotic behavior. Additionally, the current paper proposes a new hybrid modelling technique derived from the LSTARGARCH (Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model and LSTM (long-short term memory) method to analyse the volatility of oil prices. In the proposed LSTARGARCHLSTM method, GARCH modelling is applied to the crude oil prices in two regimes, where regime transitions are governed with an LSTAR-type smooth transition in both the conditional mean and the conditional variance. Separating the data into two regimes allows the efficient LSTM forecaster to adapt to and exploit the different statistical characteristics and ARCH and GARCH effects in each of the two regimes and yield better prediction performance over the case of its application to all the data. A comparison of our proposed method with the GARCH and LSTARGARCH methods for crude oil price data reveals that our proposed method achieves improved forecasting performance over the others in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) in the face of the chaotic structure of oil prices. © 2020 by the authors.","Crude oil prices; LSTARGARCH; LSTM; Time series forecasting","Costs; Long short-term memory; Lyapunov methods; Mean square error; Petroleum analysis; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Conditional variance; Forecasting performance; Nonlinear behaviours; Prediction performance; RMSE (root mean square error); Statistical characteristics; West texas intermediates; Crude oil price",,"Energies",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087929103

As access to whole-genome sequencing has grown, greater amounts of molecular data have helped improve the ability to detect and track outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19, investigate transmission chains and explore large-scale population dynamics, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself. In this Perspective, we make recommendations for developing an accessible, unified informatic ecosystem to support pathogen genomic analysis in public-health agencies across income settings. We hope that the creation of this ecosystem will allow agencies to effectively and efficiently share data, workflows and analyses and thereby increase the reproducibility, accessibility and auditability of pathogen genomic analysis while also supporting agency autonomy. © 2020, Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"Article; bioinformatics; cloud computing; consensus sequence; coronavirus disease 2019; data interoperability; data visualization; genome analysis; human; methodology; nonhuman; pathogenomics; practice guideline; priority journal; public health; reproducibility; software; workforce; antibiotic resistance; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; genetics; genomics; pandemic; pathogenicity; population dynamics; virology; virus pneumonia; whole genome sequencing; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genomics; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Dynamics; Whole Genome Sequencing","32528156","Nat.

However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

In higher education, the necessity to adopt efficient strategies to sustain education during the crisis is mobilizing diverse, complementary, and integrative action in response. In this research article, we rise to the challenge of designing and implementing a transparent strategy for social media awareness at King Abdulaziz University (KAU).We introduce a framework for social media impact, termed the KAU Pandemic Framework. This includes the factors with the most important role in enhancing the deployment of social media in crisis in order to minimize the negative impact on education's sustainability. We used a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative statistical analyses of social media data and online surveys and qualitative interviews in such a way as to construct a comprehensive framework. The results show that a methodological framework can be justified and that Twitter contributes significantly to six areas: administrative resilience; education sustainability; community responsibility; positive sentiment; community bonds; and delivery of promised value. The components of our proposed methodological framework integrate five pillars of the strategic adoption of social media: social media governance; social media resilience; social media utilization; decision-making capability; and institutional strategy. Finally, we show that the KAU Pandemic Framework can be used as strategic decision-making tool for the analysis of the gaps and inefficiencies in any social media plan that is deployed and the management challenges arising from the pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.","Administration; Best practices; COVID-19; Framework; Higher education; King Abdulaziz University; Pandemic; Social impact; Social media","decision making; higher education; management practice; methodology; questionnaire survey; social media; strategic approach; sustainability; university sector",,"Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085770267

The aim of the present review is to summarize current information about possible chemical reactions and physical processes that lead to tissue stiffening and result in age-related diseases in order to find methods that can prevent or retard time-dependent tissue stiffening. The analysis of published data shows that bound water acts as a plasticizer of biological tissues, a decrease in bound water content results in an increase in biological tissue stiffness, and increased tissue stiffness leads to NF-kB activation and triggered actin polymerization-NF-kB activation is associated with age-related diseases. It can be suggested that changes in bound water content through changing tissue stiffness can affect cellular processes and the development of pathologies related to aging.

Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent “homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio” in each case and a “homeostatic window” of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients. Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"adenosine; biological factor; biological marker; circulating free DNA; damage associated molecular pattern; DNA; high mobility group B1 protein; lipocortin 1; pattern recognition receptor; prostaglandin E2; protein S 100; specialized proresolving mediator; suppressing inhibiting damage associated molecular pattern; unclassified drug; biological marker; cell free nucleic acid; high mobility group B1 protein; HMGB1 protein, human; pathogen associated molecular pattern; protein S 100; adaptive immunity; antigen presenting cell; Article; cancer therapy; chronic inflammation; coronavirus disease 2019; dendritic cell; drug targeting; homeostasis; human; immune response; inflammation; inflammatory disease; innate immunity; nonhuman; pathogenesis; practice guideline; priority journal; protein blood level; protein function; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; tissue injury; tissue regeneration; tissue repair; vaccination; wound healing; blood; chronic disease; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; inflammation; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; physiology; procedures; Biomarkers; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; HMGB1 Protein; Homeostasis; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules; S100 Proteins; Vaccination","32248387","Mol.

Methods: Sample collection was conducted based on the standard operating procedure. Tianlong automatic magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction reagent was used for RNA extraction. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using four approved COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kits. Related epidemiological data of the cases were collected. One-way analysis of variance and non-parametric test for inter-group differences analysis were conducted using SPSS25.0 software. Results: A total of 162 PCR tests were completed for novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection in 123 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Eleven PCR results were positive for a single target gene and 10 of which were positive for nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. Nineteen cases were tested with two kinds of nucleic acid detection kits and the results of different detection kits were different. Different types of samples were collected form 13 cases for nucleic acid detection and the results showed that the Ct value of sputum sample was lower than that of throat swab sample. No significant difference in Ct values of throat swab samples was observed among patients with different clinical symptoms (PCt-N=0.797, PCt-ORF1a/b=0.551). The 123 cases were divided into different groups according to the time interval between the onset date and the date of the first positive detection of viral nucleic acid. No significant difference in Ct values of throat swab samples was observed among different time interval groups (PCt-N=0.373, PCt-ORF1a/b=0.058). Conclusions: Sputum samples were better than upper respiratory tract samples for viral nucleic acid detection. The sensitivity of N gene detection was higher, but re-sampling was needed when the result was positive for the single target N gene.

Within a short time period of only 05 months, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 213 countries, and till 28th May, 2020, nearly 5.8 million confirmed cases have been reported while taking lives of 0.36 million persons. Seeing the current situation of rapid increase in COVID-19 cases daily in many countries, this seems to be the deadliest pandemic after the 1918 Spanish Flu. There is currently no specific effective treatment for COVID-19 and also in absence of vaccine the radical cure of the disease is far away. Researchers are pacing high to design and develop effective vaccines, drugs and therapeutics to counter COVID-19, however such efforts, clinical trials, necessary approvals and then to reach the level of bulk production of many millions of doses may still take much time. Prevention and control of COVID-19 outbreaks requires an evidence-based, multi-factorial and effective mitigation strategy to be adopted. The current review discusses on the research advancements, challenges and opportunities in COVID 19 management with a focus on its transmission, prevention, treatment and control. © The Author(s) 2020.","Control; COVID-19; Prevention; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission; Treatment",,,"J.

The experimental results demonstrate that the P-SI models can describe the number of daily new infected people caused by COVID-19 in Hubei and the other 4 provinces according to the empirical data. In addition, the P-SI models can also predict the number of daily new infected people in the other 4 provinces after 1/24 according to the empirical data before 1/23. The P-SI models are steps toward the understanding of COVID-19's spreading characteristics, which provides supports to isolate the source of COVID-19, to prevent and slow down the spreading of COVID-19, and to roll out effective measures for COVID-19's prevention and control. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

The model fitting with result analysis is performed by utilizing COVID-19 data from 25 January 2020 to 22 February 2020. And then the fitted model is used to simulate the evolution after February 22, 2020. The results show that the introduction of 'undiscovered people' has a significant improvement in fitting and prediction performance, reducing the fitting error by 50% to 70%. The fitting coefficient shows that the virus-laden population accounted for 30% and 5% of exposed people, respectively, in the early and late stages of epidemic. The diagnosed probability of virus-laden population has increased from 7% to 40%, which shows that nucleic acid detection technology is becoming matured. Initial number of undiscovered people is about 70 000, and under effective national control, it is currently controlled at about 2 500.

Effective reproduction number is one of the key parameters to evaluate the effectiveness. It is difficult to estimate the effective reproduction number due to the incomplete symptom onsets. A model based on Monte Carlo method is proposed to estimate the effective reproduction number by using small number of symptom onsets. The control efficacy of Chinese mainland and some international countries is evaluated by the estimation of effective reproduction number.

The research showed that 97.6% of the patients seeking for help came from Wuhan, mainly centralized in Wuchang, Tongkou, Hanyang etc. urban areas, and the proportion is directly proportional to the local medical resources and population density. The cases of Weibo help were mainly distributed from February 4 to February 7, 2020. With the relief of medical resources, the number of cases seeking help through social media decreased significantly. The distribution of patients, whose diagnosed date was mainly from January 16 to February 6, 2020, was basically consistent with the case information released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC). The median age of patients seeking for help was 60 years old, which was much higher than the data released by the CCDC but was roughly coincident with the data of the central hospital of Wuhan. The results of this study indicate that when dealing with major outbreaks of infectious diseases, social media are equally important in epidemiological analysis as well as the role in the dissemination of public opinion. Based on the wide adoption and timeliness nature of social media, it will be helpful for decision-makers to quickly grasp the real-world situation as it is combined with data mining or big data analysis. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

COVID-19 is a serious illness with no efficacious antiviral medication or approved vaccine currently available. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the genome of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein genes from Indonesia to investigate their genetic composition and variability. Overall, ten SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene sequences retrieved from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) and the GISAID EpiCoV database (Germany) were compared. We analyzed nucleotide variants and amino acid changes using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X and analyzed gene similarity using the LALIGN web server. Interestingly, we revealed several specific mutation sites, however, there were no significant changes in the genetic composition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein genes, when compared to the Wuhan- Hu-1 isolate from China.

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets from human, non-human primate, and mouse barrier tissues identifies putative cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 represents a previously unappreciated interferon-stimulated gene in human, but not mouse, epithelial tissues, identifying anti-viral induction of a host tissue-protective mechanism, but also a potential means for viral exploitation of the host response. © 2020 The Authors","ACE2; COVID-19; human; influenza; interferon; ISG; mouse; non-human primate; SARS-CoV-2; scRNA-seq","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; interferon; serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein, human; virus receptor; ACE2 gene; adult; airway epithelium cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell subpopulation; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; gene; goblet cell; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; intestine cell; lung alveolus cell type 2; lung injury; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; primate; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single cell RNA seq; TMPRSS2 gene; upregulation; adolescent; animal; Betacoronavirus; cell culture; cell line; child; Coronavirus infection; cytology; genetics; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunology; influenza; lung; lung alveolus epithelium cell; metabolism; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nose mucosa; pandemic; pathology; physiology; rhesus monkey; single cell analysis; tuberculosis; virology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Alveolar Epithelial Cells; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Enterocytes; Goblet Cells; HIV Infections; Humans; Influenza, Human; Interferon Type I; Lung; Macaca mulatta; Mice; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nasal Mucosa; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus; Serine Endopeptidases; Single-Cell Analysis; Tuberculosis; Up-Regulation","32413319","Cell",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084425299

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA-positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Genomic and epidemiological analyses provide insights into how COVID-19 was contained in China's most populous province using a combination of surveillance and travel restriction measures. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; genomic epidemiology; phylogenetics; real-time disease surveillance; SARS-COV-2; virus evolution","adult; amplicon; Article; China; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease classification; disease duration; disease severity; disease surveillance; disease transmission; gene sequence; genetic epidemiology; genetic variability; genetic variation; human; metagenomics; molecular epidemiology; nonhuman; pandemic; phylogeny; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; Bayes theorem; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemiological monitoring; genetics; statistical model; travel; virology; virus pneumonia; Bayes Theorem; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Travel","32359424","Cell",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083889908

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity—but also aided in the control—of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6–8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 × 108 RNA copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples—in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"virus RNA; envelope protein, SARS-CoV-2; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; virus envelope protein; virus RNA; blood; immunity; pathogenicity; respiratory disease; RNA; severe acute respiratory syndrome; urine; viral disease; virus; antibody response; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease course; feces analysis; hospital patient; human; human tissue; immunofluorescence test; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; repeat procedure; RNA sequence; SARS coronavirus; seroconversion; throat culture; upper respiratory tract; urine sampling; virology; virus identification; virus immunity; virus infectivity; virus isolation; virus load; virus replication; virus shedding; Betacoronavirus; blood; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; feces; genetics; hospitalization; immunology; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; lung; nucleotide sequence; pandemic; pathogenicity; pharynx; seroconversion; single nucleotide polymorphism; sputum; urine; virus pneumonia; virus replication; China; Coronavirus; Antibodies, Viral; Base Sequence; Betacoronavirus; Blood; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Feces; Hospitalization; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Lung; Pandemics; Pharynx; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA, Viral; Seroconversion; Sputum; Urine; Viral Envelope Proteins; Viral Load; Virus Replication; Virus Shedding","32235945","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083827704

Methods • Data of COVID-19 cases in Jingzhou City from January 1 to March 12, 2020 were collected. Trend surface analysis, spatial autocorrelation and spatial-temporal scanning analysis were conducted to understand the spatial-temporal distribution of COVID-19 at town (street) level in Jingzhou City, and the spatial-temporal clustering characteristics of local cases and imported cases were compared. Results • Trend surface analysis showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 in Jingzhou City was slightly ""U"" from west to east, slightly higher in the east, and inverted ""U"" from south to north, slightly higher in the south. Global autocorrelation showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 in Jingzhou City was positively correlated (Moran's I=0.410, P=0.000). Local spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that the highly clustered areas and hot spot areas were mainly in Shashi District, Jingzhou District and the main urban area of Honghu City (Xindi Street) (P<0.05). Five clusters were found by spatial-temporal scanning of imported cases. The cluster time of the main cluster was from January 18 to February 3, 2020, and it was centered on Lianhe Street, covering 15 towns (streets) in Shashi District and Jingzhou District (LLR=174.944, RR=7.395, P=0.000). Five clusters were found by spatial-temporal scanning of local cases. The cluster time of the main cluster was from January 20 to February 24, 2020, which was located in Xindi Street, Honghu City (LLR=224.434, RR=16.133, P=0.000). Conclusion • Obvious spatialtemporal clustering of COVID-19 was found in Jingzhou City, and Shashi District, Jingzhou District and Honghu City were the most prevalent areas. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Shanghai Second Medical University.

Point-of-care (POC) biosensors, including chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically low-cost and user-friendly, which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. This mini review article discusses the recent advances in POC biosensors for COVID-19. First, the development of POC biosensors which are made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), papers, and other flexible materials such as textile, film, and carbon nanosheets are reviewed. The advantages of each biosensors along with the commercially available COVID-19 biosensors are highlighted. Lastly, the existing challenges and future perspectives of developing robust POC biosensors to rapidly identify and manage the spread of COVID-19 are briefly discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Choi.","COVID-19; flexible materials; paper; PDMS; POC biosensors",,,"Front.

The government of India has issued stringent guidelines and imposed a lockdown for long periods to ensure the practising of social distancing. This paper reviews and discusses the current trends in the confirmed cases of India in comparison with the other prominent countries around the globe. A novel approach using a sigmoid function to predict and forecast the trends for cases in India are also presented in this work. By placing the current time on the sigmoid curve, forecasting the total number of confirmed cases by the end of the pandemic is made. If proper measures and stringent guidelines are not followed, India may have to endure a total confirmed case of up to 4.4 lakh. The prediction also suggests that 99.9% of the pandemic may end in India by 27th July 2020. The best possible approach is to undertake preventive measures by strictly adhering to the guidelines and policies set by the government. Performing hand hygiene, practicing social distancing, surveillance and isolation is the only means to break the chain of transmission and control the pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Forecasting; India; Sigmoid",,,"J.

Reliable laboratory diagnosis of the disease has been one of the foremost priorities for promoting public health interventions. The routinely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the reference method for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it also reported a number of false-positive or-negative cases, especially in the early stages of the novel virus outbreak. In this work, a dual-functional plasmonic biosensor combining the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction provides an alternative and promising solution for the clinical COVID-19 diagnosis. The two-dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) functionalized with complementary DNA receptors can perform a sensitive detection of the selected sequences from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through nucleic acid hybridization. For better sensing performance, the thermoplasmonic heat is generated on the same AuNIs chip when illuminated at their plasmonic resonance frequency. The localized PPT heat is capable to elevate the in situ hybridization temperature and facilitate the accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences. Our dual-functional LSPR biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a lower detection limit down to the concentration of 0.22 pM and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multigene mixture. This study gains insight into the thermoplasmonic enhancement and its applicability in the nucleic acid tests and viral disease diagnosis. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","biosensors; coronavirus disease; LSPR; nuclei acids; plasmonic photothermal effect; RNA virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","Biosensors; Diagnosis; DNA sequences; Health risks; Plasmonics; Polymerase chain reaction; Public health; Surface plasmon resonance; Transcription; Viruses; Health interventions; In-situ hybridization; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Lower detection limit; Nucleic acid hybridization; Plasmonic biosensors; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Diseases; complementary DNA; gold; metal nanoparticle; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; coronavirus disease 2019; devices; genetic procedures; genetics; heat; nucleic acid hybridization; procedures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface plasmon resonance; Betacoronavirus; Biosensing Techniques; DNA, Complementary; Gold; Hot Temperature; Metal Nanoparticles; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Surface Plasmon Resonance","32281785","ACS Nano",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083419257

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, test centers were shut down in many countries, and major tests including the TOEFL iBT and IELTS could not be administered. The DET is an “at home” test, and thus many universities began accepting DET scores as ameasure of applicants’ English proficiency. Because a revised version of the DET was launched in July, 2019, and because of the large increase in universities accepting DET scores, a critical review of the DET is warranted. The current review lauds the accessibility of the test (e.g., it is an inexpensive “at home” test that can be taken anywhere, in less than an hour, with scores returned in 48 hours). However, the test has multiple shortcomings: the test tasks have little in common with the types of language tasks university students engage in; the test does not assess test takers’ academic language ability, discourse level competence, or interactional competence; it is susceptible to cheating and test preparation; and it has a potential for negative washback on learners and learning systems. In addition, there is a lack of independent research validating the use of DET scores for admissions. Given these shortcomings, the use of DET scores cannot be recommended for university admissions purposes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,,,"Lang. Assess. Q.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087507886

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence. © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.","2019-nCoV; acute respiratory disease; Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; epidemiology; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","adolescent; adult; age; age distribution; aged; Australia; Betacoronavirus; child; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease notification; epidemic; female; global health; health survey; history; hospitalization; human; incidence; infant; intensive care unit; male; medical geography; middle aged; mortality; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; risk factor; season; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Notification; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Geography, Medical; Global Health; History, 21st Century; Hospitalization; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Factors; Seasons; Young Adult","32522141","Commun Dis Intell (2018)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086355641

The ISNs are open systems with structural dynamics since the firms may exhibit multiple behaviours by changing the buyer-supplier roles in interconnected or even competing SCs. From the positions of resilience, the ISNs as a whole provide services to society (e.g. food service, mobility service or communication service) which are required to ensure a long-term survival. The analysis of survivability at the level of ISN requires a consideration at a large scale as resilience of individual SCs. The recent example of coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak clearly shows the necessity of this new perspective. Our study introduces a new angle in SC resilience research when a resistance to extraordinary disruptions needs to be considered at the scale of viability. We elaborate on the integrity of the ISN and viability. The contribution of our position study lies in a conceptualisation of a novel decision-making environment of ISN viability.

It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence. © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.","2019-nCoV; acute respiratory disease; Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; epidemiology; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","adolescent; adult; aged; Australia; child; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; health survey; human; infant; mass screening; middle aged; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Surveillance; Young Adult","32438898","Commun Dis Intell (2018)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085156063

SARS-CoV-2 has severely crippled the healthcare system and has caused huge economic losses. Following the outbreak, the SARS-CoV-2 was recognized timely and its genome was sequenced, leading to the development of real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for its detection in clinical samples collected from suspected cases.

ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000–5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs.

Better approaches of diagnostics and medical facilities have helped some countries recover early. Previous exposures to epidemics have imparted lessons to handle such a pandemic with a high level of preparedness. The World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities are taking great efforts via efficient and impactful interventions to contain the virus. Diagnostic tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction are increasingly being used to confirm the diagnosis because testing biological samples for the presence of the virus is the definitive method to identify the disease, analyze the risk for transmission, and determine whether someone has been cured or not. It is also important to screen asymptomatic individuals to get the exact overview of the virus spread. Antibody detection plays a pivotal role in diagnosis; however, using it at the wrong time yields negative results and conveys dissenting opinion about the tests. Although the scaling up of testing has been significant, overall testing has been limited by the availability of diagnostics. Rapid diagnoses and discontinuation of transmission are keys to ending this pandemic. Diagnostics manufacturers are developing test kits and distributing them to different countries. Therefore, more than 500 commercial test kits for molecular- and immunoassays, most with Emergency Use Authorization, are now becoming available in the market. In this review, we discuss the importance of diagnostics, approaches of different countries toward the epidemic, global testing situation, and lessons to countries at the start of the epidemic for better preparedness. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Diagnosis; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity; Specificity","China; community; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; Germany; human; India; Italy; Nigeria; nonhuman; pandemic; Peru; Review; Singapore; South Korea; United States; virus transmission",,"J.

In this paper, a novel neural network called WisdomNet has been proposed, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. The WisdomNet uses the concept of 'Wisdom of Crowds' as its founding idea. It is a two-layered convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes chest x-ray images as input. Both layers of the proposed neural network consist of a number of neural networks each. The dataset used for this study consists of chest x-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients, compiled and shared by Dr. Cohen on GitHub, and the chest x-ray images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by viral and bacterial pneumonia were obtained from Kaggle. The network not only pinpoints the presence of COVID-19, but also gives the probability of the disease maturing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus, predicting the progression of the disease in the COVID-19 positive patients. The network also slender the occurrences of false negative cases by employing a high threshold value, thus aids in curbing the spread of the disease and gives an accuracy of 100% for successfully predicting COVID-19 among the chest x-rays of patients affected with COVID-19, bacterial and viral pneumonia. © 2020 The Author(s).","ARDS; Chest x-rays; Convolutional neural networks; COVID-19; WisdomNet","adult respiratory distress syndrome; bacterial pneumonia; clinical article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early diagnosis; false negative result; human; image analysis; lung; predictive value; probability; prognosis; prospective study; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; WisdomNet",,"J.

METHODS: Based on the existing literature, the infection pathways of new coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) were systematically summarized by us, and used the SWISSDOCK molecular simulation method to carry out virtual screen systematically for key targets and marketed drugs. RESULTS: TMPRSS2/ACE2 pathway was found to be the most efficient and probably the major pathway for SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect the lung and other tissue by us. Bromhexine, an expectorant, can strongly inhibit TMPRSS2 protease (EC50:0.75 μmol•L-1) in vitro. Bromhexine has few adverse effects and also has the beneficial effects of promoting the release and maintenance of endogenous active substances in the lung, alveolar function, and promoting sputum excretion, which is suitable for use together with other COVID19 medication and therapies. CONCLUSION: Bromhexine has a unique potential antiviral mechanism, and clinical research should be conducted to play its role in the prevention, treatment and prognosis of COVID19.

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Currently new notifications in Australia are mostly considered to be locally-acquired with some cases still reported among people with recent overseas travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case or known cluster, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.3%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (7.1%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.7%) and the United Kingdom (15.4%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.","2019-nCoV; acute respiratory disease; Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; epidemiology; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","adult; aged; Australia; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; female; health survey; human; isolation and purification; male; middle aged; pandemic; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Young Adult","32393161","Commun Dis Intell (2018)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084532680

METHODS: Both the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were applied to analyze safety signals of chloroquine based upon the adverse drug events (ADEs) data ranging from 2004 to 2020 as reported in the Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to systematically assesse the safety signals of chloroquine phosphate on various organs systems. RESULTS: Among the 2 063 reports of ADEs studied, 557 reports were considered to be mainly caused by chloroquine. The results demonstrated that the high-risk ADEs signals of chloroquine involved various systems, such as atrioventricular block complete (ROR=2.90, IC-2SD=1.64), ventricular fibrillation (ROR=3.40, IC-2SD=1.27), blindness (ROR=27.51, IC-2SD=0.55), cardiogenic shock (ROR=6.86, IC-2SD=0.54), vomiting (ROR=1.70, IC-2SD=1.83). Moreover, some rare ADEs with high-risk signals showed a correlation with chloroquine, including hypokalaemia (ROR=4.18,IC-2SD=1.51), renal failure acute (ROR=3.08, IC-2SD=0.30), methaemoglobinaemia (ROR=4.37, IC-2SD=0.03), and pyrexia (ROR=1.80, IC-2SD=1.84), which were consistent with literature reports. However, these ADEs were not listed in instruction and worth much attention in clinic. Moreover, basic diseases of patients and drug incompatibility need much attention to prevent the occurrence and exacerbation of chloroquine-related adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive analysis of the ADEs signals of chloroquine could shed some light on understanding of its safety characteristics and would provide valuable information for rational use of chloroquine in clinic, especially in treatment of COVID-19.

Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data. In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses. An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

A space remote sensing dynamic monitoring system for urban complex is proposed and constructed from the aspects of application demand, technical method, remote sensing products, management release, etc. Using the system, the construction progress and surrounding water environment monitoring of the urban complex of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital are carried out. The construction progress of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital is monitored by high-resolution optical satellites such as Gaofen-2, Jilin-1 and Pleiades, which is identical with the construction progress in the news report and the officially published hospital area. The construction intensity of Huoshenshan Hospital is monitored by the high-resolution night light satellite Jilin-1, most areas of the construction plant are under high-intensity construction at night. The water environment around Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital is monitored by the hyperspectral satellite Zhuhai-1, the construction process has no significant impact on the surrounding water environment. The surface stability of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital before construction is analyzed by the high-resolution radar satellite Sentinel-1A, there is no obvious surface subsidence in the construction area of Huoshenshan Hospital, and there are different degrees of surface subsidence signals in the surrounding areas of Leishenshan Hospital. In the critical period of fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), it has met the public’s attention needs and plays a certain role in stabilizing social mood. A retrospective monitoring of the collapse of Xinjia hotel in Quanzhou is carried out to provide data reference for accident liability analysis. The deformation of Xinjia hotel is mainly caused by the south wall, and the foundation settlement is not obvious. This result is consistent with the fact that the hotel collapses to the south, and the main reason for the collapse is the instability of the internal structure of the building, rather than the uneven ground settlement.

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even though multiple vaccines and treatments are under development so far, the disease is only slowing down under extreme social distancing measures that are difficult to maintain. SARS-COV-2 is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store. The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis. Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. In this review, we discuss the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection as well as the possibility of targeting lipid metabolism to interfere with the viral life cycle. © 2020 by the authors.

Four hybridization chain reaction reactions are demonstrated herein, targeting N1/N2/N3 loci and human RNase P. The design of the hybridization chain reaction, herein, is assisted with an algorithm. The algorithm helps to search target sequences with low local secondary structure and high hybridization efficiency. The loop domain of the fuel hairpin molecule H1 and H2, which are the tunable segments in such reactions, are used as an optimization parameter to improve the hybridization efficiency of the chain reaction. The algorithm-derived HCR reactions were validated with gel electrophoresis. All proposed reactions exhibit a hybridization complex with a molecular mass >1.5k base pairs, which is clear evidence of chain reaction. The hybridization efficiency trend revealed by gel electrophoresis corresponds nicely to the simulated data from the algorithm. The HCR reactions and the corresponding algorithm serve as a basis to further SARS–CoV-2 sensing applications and facilitate better screening strategies for the prevention of on-going pandemics. © 2020 by the authors.

The performance of this type of device and the criteria for screening are worth studying. This study evaluated the performance of two types of tympanic infrared thermometers and an industrial infrared thermometer. The results showed that these infrared thermometers provide good precision. A fixed offset between tympanic and forehead temperature were found. The measurement values for wrist temperature show significant offsets with the tympanic temperature and cannot be used to screen fevers. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for the measurement of body temperature using an infrared thermometer was proposed.

This is due to the highly infectious nature of the disease and its possibility to cause pneumonia induced death in approximately 6.89% of infected individuals (data until 27 April 2020). The pathogen causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to be originated from the Wuhan Province in China. Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile. This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs.

The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods: We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings: Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation: MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; MERS-CoV S1; Microneedle array; SARS-CoV-2; Subunit vaccines; Trimerization","coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; influenza vaccine; neutralizing antibody; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 5; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; COVID-19 vaccine; fusion protein; immunoglobulin G; immunological adjuvant; subunit vaccine; virus antibody; virus vaccine; affinity chromatography; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antibody response; antibody titer; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gamma irradiation; genetic transfection; good manufacturing practice; humoral immunity; immunogenicity; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein purification; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus morphology; virus neutralization; virus replication; virus shedding; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; Betacoronavirus; biosynthesis; blood; C57BL mouse; Coronavirus infection; germfree animal; immunology; secondary immunization; subcutaneous drug administration; time factor; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Immunization, Secondary; Immunoglobulin G; Injections, Subcutaneous; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Time Factors; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines","32249203","EBioMedicine",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082819983

We use a combination of genomic analysis and sensitive profile-based sequence and structure analysis to understand the potential pathogenesis determinants of this virus. As a re-sult, we identify several fast-evolving genomic regions that might be at the interface of virus-host interactions, corresponding to the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, the three tandem Macro fold domains in ORF1a, and the uncharacter-ized protein ORF8. Further, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha-and beta-CoVs belong to novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished by being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert, and having a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its pre-dicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover numerous Ig domain proteins from several unrelated metazoan viruses, which are distinct in sequence and structure but share comparable architectures to those of the CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and other previously unidentified CoV Ig domain proteins fall under the umbrella of a widespread strategy of deployment of Ig domain proteins in animal viruses as pathogenicity factors that modulate host immu-nity. The rapid evolution of the ORF8 Ig domain proteins points to a potential evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts, likely arising from immune pressure, and suggests a role in transmission between distinct host species. IMPORTANCE The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strongly emphasizes the need for a more complete understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of its causative agent SARS-CoV-2. Despite intense scrutiny, several proteins encoded by the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses remain enigmatic. More-over, the high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals make wet-lab studies currently challenging. In this study, we used a series of computational strategies to identify several fast-evolving regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which are potentially under host immune pressure. Most notably, the hitherto-uncharacterized protein encoded by ORF8 is one of them. Using sensitive sequence and structural analysis methods, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha-and beta-coronavirus comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential immune modulators to delay or attenuate the host immune response against the viruses. © 2020 Tan et al.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Evolution; Immune evasion; Immunoglobulin; ORF8; Pathogenesis; SARS","immunoglobulin; protein ORF8; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus spike protein; viral protein; virulence factor; Alphacoronavirus; amino terminal sequence; animal virus; Article; Betacoronavirus; binding site; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; evolution; gene insertion; genetic analysis; immunoglobulin domain; immunoglobulin variable region; immunomodulation; ligand binding; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; open reading frame; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; receptor binding; sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; structure analysis; virus cell interaction; virus genome; virus immunity; virus transmission; virus virulence; amino acid sequence; animal; chemistry; classification; comparative study; Coronavirinae; genetics; host range; human; molecular evolution; molecular model; pathogenicity; phylogeny; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Host Specificity; Humans; Immunoglobulin Domains; Models, Molecular; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; Viral Proteins; Virulence Factors","32471829","mBio",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085713481

The virus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with mild-to-severe respiratory illness. The currently available diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of COVID-19 are mainly based on molecular assays. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the only diagnostic method currently recommended by the World Health Organization for COVID-19. With the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to utilize other tests, which would determine the burden of the disease as well as the spread of the outbreak. Considering the need for the development of such a screening test, an attempt was made to develop and evaluate an IgG-based ELISA for COVID-19. Methods: A total of 513 blood samples (131 positive, 382 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were collected and tested by microneutralization test (MNT). Antigen stock of SARS-CoV-2 was prepared by propagating the virus in Vero CCL-81 cells. An IgG capture ELISA was developed for serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum samples. The end point cut-off values were determined by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Inter-assay variability was determined. Results: The developed ELISA was found to be 92.37 per cent sensitive, 97.9 per cent specific, robust and reproducible. The positive and negative predictive values were 94.44 and 98.14 per cent, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: This indigenously developed IgG ELISA was found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum samples. This assay may be used for determining seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population exposed to the virus.

By means of whole-genome sequence comparisons, we demonstrate that the noncoding flanks of the viral genome can be used to correctly separate the recognized four betacoronavirus subspecies. The conservation would be sufficient to define target sequences that could, in theory, classify novel virus species into their subspecies. Only 253 upstream noncoding sequences of Sarbecovirus are sufficient to identify genetic similarities between species of this subgenus. Furthermore, it was investigated which bat species have commercial value in China, and would thus likely be handled for trading purposes. A number of coronavirus genomes have been published that were obtained from such bat species. These bats are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and their handling poses a potential risk to cause zoonotic coronavirus epidemics. Significance and Impact of the Study: The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel Betacoronavirus species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown.

COVID-19 is now a global pandemic and public health emergency due to rapid human-to-human transmission. The impact is far-reaching, with enforced social distancing and isolation, detrimental effects on individual physical activity and mental wellbeing, education in the young and economic impact to business. Whilst most COVID-19 patients demonstrate mild-to-moderate symptoms, those with severe disease progression are at a higher risk of mortality. As more is learnt about this novel disease, it is becoming evident that comorbid cardiovascular disease is associated with a greater severity and increased mortality. Many patients positive for COVID-19 demonstrate increased concentrations of cardiac troponin, creating confusion in clinical interpretation. While myocardial infarction is associated with acute infectious respiratory disease, the majority of COVID-19 patients demonstrate stable cTn rather than the dynamically changing values indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. Although full understanding of the mechanism of cTn release in COVID-19 is currently lacking, this mini-review assesses the limited published literature with a view to offering insight to pathophysiological mechanisms and reported treatment regimens. © The Author(s) 2020.","analytes; cardiac troponin I; cardiac troponin T; Covid-19; SARS-Cov-2; Troponin","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; troponin; biological marker; troponin; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease transmission; epidemic; heart infarction; incubation time; infection risk; laboratory test; myocarditis; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein secretion; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Troponin","32255359","Ann.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA). We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals. Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone. All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies. © 2020 by the authors.

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures. © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.","2019-nCoV; acute respiratory disease; Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; epidemiology; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Australia; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","32362270","Commun Dis Intell (2018)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084249375

Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials. To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model. While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group. Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group. To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprineimmunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers. Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect in vivo virus titers. Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems. Despite serious public health concerns, no effective vaccines or therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies. In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model. While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi. Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection. As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial. © 2020 Park et al.","Antiviral therapeutics; COVID-19; Ferrets; Immunosuppression; Serum neutralization; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","azathioprine; emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; hydroxychloroquine sulfate; lopinavir plus ritonavir; phosphate buffered saline; antivirus agent; hydroxychloroquine; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; animal experiment; animal model; antibody titer; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; critical illness; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug repositioning; drug safety; feces analysis; female; Food and Drug Administration; immune deficiency; in vivo study; lung parenchyma; Mustela putorius furo; nonhuman; nose smear; priority journal; rhinorrhea; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; turbinate; viral clearance; virus load; virus neutralization; animal; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; disease model; drug effect; human; immunology; Mustela putorius furo; pandemic; United States; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Ferrets; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Viral Load","32444382","mBio",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085537887

Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment. This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic. This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients’ in need of the required urgent dental care. Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic. This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients’ management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit.

Maximal precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by most nations in war footing to mitigate transmission and decrease fatality rates. This article was aimed to review the evidence on clinical management and to deal with the identification of high-risk groups, warning signs, appropriate investigations, proper sample collection for confirmation, general and specific treatment measures, strategies as well as infection control in the healthcare settings. Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage. Among the currently available drugs, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, awaiting further clinical trials. Stringent droplet and contact precautions will protect healthcare workers against most clinical exposures to COVID-19.

The COVID-19 epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience. It is unknown whether certain groups, for example children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness.

COVID-19 is a pandemic with an estimated death rate between 1% and 5%; and an estimated R0 between 2.2 and 6.7 according to various sources. As of March 28th, 2020, there were over 649,000 confirmed cases and 30,249 total deaths, globally. In the United States, there were over 115,500 cases and 1891 deaths and this number is likely to increase rapidly. It is critical to detect clusters of COVID-19 to better allocate resources and improve decision-making as the outbreaks continue to grow. Using daily case data at the county level provided by Johns Hopkins University, we conducted a prospective spatial-temporal analysis with SaTScan. We detect statistically significant space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. between January 22nd-March 9th, 2020, and January 22nd-March 27th, 2020. The space-time prospective scan statistic detected “active” and emerging clusters that are present at the end of our study periods – notably, 18 more clusters were detected when adding the updated case data. These timely results can inform public health officials and decision makers about where to improve the allocation of resources, testing sites; also, where to implement stricter quarantines and travel bans. As more data becomes available, the statistic can be rerun to support timely surveillance of COVID-19, demonstrated here. Our research is the first geographic study that utilizes space-time statistics to monitor COVID-19 in the U.S. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Disease surveillance; Pandemic; SaTScan; Space-time clusters","cluster analysis; COVID-19; detection method; disease spread; medical geography; respiratory disease; viral disease; China; Hubei; United States; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Appl.

We compare the modeling results to two related existing models based on a new criteria and several existing criteria for model selection. The results show the proposed model fits significantly better than the other two related models based on the U.S. Covid-19 death data. We observe that the errors of the fitted data and the predicted data points on the total number of deaths in the U.S. on the last available data point and the next coming day are less than 0.5% and 2.0%, respectively. The results show very encouraging predictability for the model. The new model predicts that the maximum total number of deaths will be approximately 62,100 across the United States due to the Covid-19 virus, and with a 95% confidence that the expected total death toll will be between 60,951 and 63,249 deaths based on the data until 22 April, 2020. If there is a significant change in the coming days due to various testing strategies, social-distancing policies, the reopening of community strategies, or a stay-home policy, the predicted death tolls will definitely change. Future work can be explored further to apply the proposed model to global Covid-19 death data and to other applications, including human population mortality, the spread of disease, and different topics such as movie reviews in recommender systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Covid-19; Model criteria; Model prediction; Model selection; Number of death estimation",,,"Mathematics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085571719

In the civilian domain, it can provide quantitative evidence to investigate urban mobility and traffic patterns in cities. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can help in detecting vehicles in (almost) all weather conditions and during the day and night. In this study, the capability of SAR StripMap imaging mode data to monitor traffic is analyzed using the case study of Wuhan, China. In ordinary times, the bridges crossing the Yangtze river are the key infrastructure allowing for urban mobility inWuhan. More recently, the city has been the first in the world to be put in lockdown due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Using a very long time series of 294 COSMO-SkyMed StripMap HIMAGE mode scenes collected from 2011 to 2020, we detected vehicles on seven bridges, estimated their speed, and analyzed the traffic pattern over time. Vehicles are detected based on their azimuth shift caused by their across-track motion. Our goal is to monitor the variations in traffic instead of single-car detection. The results from 2011 to 2019 show a general increase in the number of vehicles crossing the bridges, as new infrastructure was built over the years. Variations in detected vehicle numbers were especially found during the two events of the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games in October 2019, and the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020. These events were therefore used for internal validation of our assessment of traffic patterns. On the other side, TomTom traffic index data were used for external validation. The results and their comparison with TomTom data prove the effectiveness of our method in detecting traffic patterns, but also demonstrate that mostly large vehicles (e.g., trucks or buses) are detected. Future work should be carried out to improve the detection rate of smaller vehicles. © 2020 by the authors.","COSMO-SkyMed; COVID-19; Moving target detection; SAR; Traffic patterns; Wuhan","Military vehicles; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Detection rates; Long time series; Number of vehicles; Situational awareness; Traffic pattern; Urban mobility; Vehicle detection; Vehicle numbers; Vehicle to infrastructure",,"Remote Sens.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085565638

Methods: Clinical data and CT images of 23 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University were retrospectively collected, and the chest CT findings were summarized and analyzed. Result: Of the 23 patients, 56.5% (13/23) had bilateral disease, 69.6% (16/23) had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundle, 65.2% (15/23) had lesions distributed periphery, 82.6% (19/23) involved in the basal segment of lower lobe, 82.6% (19/23) had ground-glass opacities, 30.4% (7/23) had ground-glass opacities with consolidation, 26.1% (6/23) had reticular changes. In the stage of disease progression, 54.6% (6/11) had an increased number of lesions, and 63.6% (7/11) had the scope of lesions enlarged and density increased. In the remission stage, 25.0% (4/16) had reduced number of lesions, 81.3% (13/16) had scope of lesions reduced, 62.5% (10/16) had density of lesions decreased, and 37.5% (6/16) had fibrosis.

This study presents the combination of deep learning of extracted features with the Q-deformed entropy handcrafted features for discriminating between COVID-19 coronavirus, pneumonia and healthy computed tomography (CT) lung scans. In this study, pre-processing is used to reduce the effect of intensity variations between CT slices. Then histogram thresholding is used to isolate the background of the CT lung scan. Each CT lung scan undergoes a feature extraction which involves deep learning and a Q-deformed entropy algorithm. The obtained features are classified using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network classifier. Subsequently, combining all extracted features significantly improves the performance of the LSTM network to precisely discriminate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases.

There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing “trained” nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in COVID-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with MMR in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to COVID-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with MMR in high-risk populations may provide a “low-risk–high-reward” preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Fidel and Noverr.","Clinical trial; COVID-19; Inflammation; Live attenuated vaccines; MMR; Myeloid-derived suppressor cells; Sepsis; Trained innate immunity","BCG vaccine; live vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; BCG vaccine; live vaccine; antibody titer; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; high risk population; human; immunocompromised patient; inflammation; influenza; innate immunity; mortality; myeloid-derived suppressor cell; nonhuman; pandemic; pneumonia; priority journal; sepsis; vaccination; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; cross protection; immunology; measles; mumps; Mycobacterium bovis; pandemic; pathology; rubella; virus pneumonia; BCG Vaccine; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Protection; Humans; Measles; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Mumps; Mycobacterium bovis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rubella; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated","32561657","mBio",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086753888

Once identified, probable patients may be sent for more Covid-19 test for identification. This initial challenge is tickled by using thermal imaging with the use of thermal cameras over the entire world. It requires the manual operation for scanning of people. It is so risky for human being that handles the whole operation of scanning. Humanoid robot is designed for instructing, alerting and scanning of entering peoples for the sake of more prevention from Corona virus. Low cost humanoid robot is designed using Girl Mannequin plastic body. Hand and neck mechanism is developed using 2-axis Motion Mechanism. All the corresponding motions are modelled for particular action for scanning of person in front of it. Activation of data capturing and scanning schedule is initiated once entry of person is identified using PIR proximity sensor. Temperature data recorded is analysed and decision is taken place by opening and non-opening of entry gate. Buzzer, voice indication with SMS alert is given by robot for further action if scanned data is found abnormal. Whole Robot system is implemented and is tested for real time operation.

This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one). From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound.

The main goal of voting, in a scenario involving the citizens of a given country, is to come up with leaders of the people’s choice. Some of the problems involved in existing voting systems include vote rigging during election, insecure or inaccessible polling stations, inadequate polling materials and also inexperienced personnel. In the era of Internet of Things/Everything, it is decadent to say online voting is not secure.Rather we have to arise with Aadhaar as an enabler. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) ensures and slogs so that its ecosystem adopts measures to keep Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) up to dateand safe. Also, in current situation where almost whole world is facing pandemic situation because of COVID-19, only E-services like E-Banking, E-Learning, E-voting are unaffectedly operational. Proposed system seeks to address these issues. Voters can vote from anywhere around the globe online, satisfying the condition that they have a valid Aadhaar card and they are registered voters. We are proposing multilevel voter identity protocol for secure online voting. We are naming our proposed work as COVID (Consolidate Online Voter IDentification) as it is merging CIDR with E-voting system. In this, the Aadhaar number authenticates Demographic details and fingerprints to develop an online identity service system. The paper is complemented with algorithms for Multiple Face detection, Eye-blinking detection or eye-tracking as a countermeasure against spoofing in face recognition systems. Objective of this work includes online voting system to automate the data flow and validating the system to ensure that only legible voters are permitted to vote and only once. Considering enormity of CIDR, scope of the work can be extended by incorporating iris detection system for authenticating voters.

We develop a ‘mechanistic-statistical’ approach coupling a SIR epidemiological model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor ×8 (95%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5% (95%-CI: 0.3-0.8) based on hospital death counting data. Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8% (95%-CI: 0.45-1.25).

Investigations into these changes are very important for decision makers to implement policies on economic loss assessments and stimulation packages, city reopening, resilience of the environment, and arrangement of medical resources. In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives, activities, and the natural environment, this paper investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of Nighttime Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI) before and during the pandemic in mainland China. The monthly mean NTL radiance, and daily and monthly mean AQI are calculated over mainland China and compared before and during the pandemic. Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation, and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 (nWcm-2. sr-1), respectively. We found that the Number of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for mainland China from January to March 2020, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of mainland China has improved with the reduction in non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage. This evidence demonstrates that the Chinese government has executed very stringent quarantine policies to deal with the pandemic. The decisive response to control the spread of COVID-19 provides a reference for other parts of the world. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Earth system; Impact and response; Pandemic; Resilience","Air quality; Decision making; Housing; Losses; Luminance; Pixels; Plant shutdowns; Air quality indices; Chinese Government; Natural environments; Night-time lights; Residential areas; Spatiotemporal patterns; Surrounding environment; Temporal characteristics; Air cleaners",,"Remote Sens.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085544930

Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR-UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate’s health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging. Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring. © 2020 by the authors.","Algorithm; Fall detection; Heart rate; IR-UWB radar; Motion detection; Respiration rate; Sleep monitoring; Vital signs","Biomedical signal processing; Health; Heart; Impulse noise; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Radar measurement; Radar signal processing; Radio; Radio transceivers; Remote patient monitoring; Building collapse; Health monitoring; Heart-rate monitoring; Impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB); Multi-path interference; Non-invasive monitoring; Remote health monitoring; Signal processing technique; Ultra-wideband (UWB); breathing rate; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; devices; heart rate; human; pandemic; physiologic monitoring; procedures; radiofrequency radiation; signal processing; telecommunication; telemedicine; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Heart Rate; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radar; Radio Waves; Respiratory Rate; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Telemedicine","32349382","Sensors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084170606

Methods: A total of 104 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital with COVID-19 from January to February 2020 were selected as research group. Fifty-one healthy subjects were selected during the same period as negative control group. Serum antibodies (IgM/IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using two kinds of colloidal gold kits (A and B kits) and one chemiluminescence kit (C kit). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different samples from patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The clinical sensitivity of A kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG was 77.88% (81/104) and 65.38% (68/104), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 70.59% (36/51) and 100.00% (51/51). However, the false positive rate in IgM detection was as high as 29.41% (15/51). The sensitivity of B kit to test total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 63.46% (66/104), and the clinical specificity was 94.12% (48/51). The clinical sensitivity of C kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG were respectively 31.73% (33/104) and 64.42% (67/104), and the clinical specificity were both 98.04% (50/51). There was a moderate correlation between the detection results of two colloidal gold kits and the chemiluminescence kit with the Kappa values of 0.462 and 0.587 (Z=6.157, P<0.01; Z=7.345, P<0.01). C kit had the highest positive detection rate for IgG, and would be more reliable to be used for IgG detection in COVID-19 patients 14 d after onset. The total positive detection rate of nucleic acid in all types of samples was 63.46% (66/104). The highest positive detection rate was in throat swabs or sputum samples, followed by those in blood samples and anal swabs. No viral nucleic acid was detected in urine samples for the time being. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies could be detected in the early or late stage of COVID-19. The method of antibody detection has the advantages of shorter detection time, simple operation and high biological safety, indicating that it could be used as a supplementary or auxiliary detection for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases with negative nucleic acid test results. The chemiluminescence kit has good sensitivity and specificity, and is well recommended for clinical laboratories.

Methods: Laboratory test data and basic case information of Henan COVID-19 cases were collected from the China's Infectious Disease Information System as of March 5, 2020. All information was entered by local hospitals and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Local hospitals or country CDC were responsible for sampling and municipal CDC was responsible for nucleic acid testing. Results: A total of 6 714 specimens were detected and the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 23.82%. The specimens were collected from 1 200 confirmed cases, 2 178 suspected cases and 77 asymptomatic cases. The nucleic acid diagnosis rate of COVID-19 was 36.96% (1 277/3 455). In all cases, the positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasal swabs, sputum samples and throat swabs were 19.38%, 28.59% and 23.53%, respectively (χ2=15.896, P&lt;0.01).

The causative agent of COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease rapidly spreads from China to the world by trading and traveling. Until April 24, 2020, approximately 2,544,792 cases were confirmed with 175,694 deaths throughout the world. The highest number of cases were identified from the United States of America (USA) whereas the mortality rate is high in Portugal. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on Computed Tomography Scanning (CT Scan) and Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Assessing the extension of pathology, the exact location of the area involved, and assessment of the disease severity makes CT scan superior to other modalities. This review shows that real-time polymerase chain reaction and imaging technology both play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, imaging modalities have more importance in diagnosis and screening than qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR was positive in 81.3% whereas CT scan abnormality was observed in 89.8%. Bilateral lobe (51.4%) abnormality was found more than a single lobe (21.5%) in COVID-19 infected patients. The CT scan reports show a high-level abnormality in right lower lung lobe than others in COVID-19 infected patients. The CT scan evaluates different manifestations such as the presence of ground-glass opacities, consolidations, crazy paying linear, cavitation, discrete nodules, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. It is concluded that imaging technology especially CT scan and X-rays play an important role in the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients in limited access to qRT-PCR regions. The common radiological manifestation was also determined, which will be helpful for the radiologist to diagnosed COVID-19 infected patients in the early stages.

Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 × 101 pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 × 102 copies/mL).

Seven types of coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans, among which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are fatal for humans. It is well established that CypA is essential for the replication of various coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and FCoV. Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses. These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases.

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.

But this action is not really effective even it might cause the spread of the coronavirus from the infectious people to the person who does the screening process. In order to solve this issue, the fast and precise identification of coronavirus is needed. The aim of this study is to design a system that has capability to detect the coronavirus automatically from the thermal image fast with less human interactions using IoT based smart glasses technology. Furthermore, the proposed design has capability to perform face detection on suspected case of Covid-19 among crowds who has high body temperature.

Early detection with fast and sensitive assays and timely intervention are crucial for interrupting the spread of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Using a mismatch-tolerant amplification technique, we developed a simple, rapid, sensitive and visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on its N gene. The assay has a high specificity and sensitivity, and robust reproducibility, and its results can be monitored using a real-time PCR machine or visualized via colorimetric change from red to yellow. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 µL reaction. The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 µL reaction. To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay showed perfect agreement in detection with the RT-qPCR assay. The newly-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is a simple and rapid method for COVID-19 surveillance. © 2020 by the authors.

While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2. Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy. Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Given that several currently marketed drugs may be efficient therapeutic agents for severe COVID-19 cases, they may be beneficial for future viral pandemics and other infections caused by RNA viruses when standard treatments are unavailable. © 2020 by the authors.

Analyzing China’s failed early warning for the COVID-19 outbreak, we show that an epidemic governance system dominated by bureaucratic forces is doomed to failure. In particular, we identify the lack of autonomy of scientific/professional communities—in this case, virologists, physicians, and epidemiologists—as one of the major contributing factors to the malfunction of the early warning system. Drawing upon the idea of community governance, we argue that only by empowering scientific/professional groups to exert efficient community governance can a state modernize its early warning system and perform better in combatting epidemics. © 2020, © 2020 Zhejiang University.","Community governance; COVID-19; early warning of the epidemic; professional autonomy; scientific community",,,"J.

We find that the disease control experts have a clear tendency and preference to make conservative judgment about the epidemic risk of a low probability and high impact new disease. This conservative preference may have been a major factor in the judging and communicating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic. The experts’ perception of the epidemic risk is affected by their habitual thinking facing a low probability event with uncertain progression. Their conservative preference is augmented by political concerns due to the high social and political impact of the event and the potential political consequence of a false judgment. Balancing personal payoffs of decision options, the experts’ rational choice would lean towards a conservative decision. We propose a three-factor decision model that integrates habitual thinking, political concerns and rational choice to explain the experts’ conservative judgment, and corroborate the model with evidences from the case.

Of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay by Abbott that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min. Most molecular tests have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) and are Conformité Européenne (CE) marked. A wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), manual ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulinM(IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ongoing research efforts and advances in complementary technologies will pave the way to new POC IVD assays in the coming months.

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks.

In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years. The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential “super spreader” may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection. It was concluded that Covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation, especially for those with COPD.

Three deep transfer models are selected in this research for investigation. The models are the Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected for investigation through this research as it contains a small number of layers on their architectures, this will result in reducing the complexity, the consumed memory and the execution time for the proposed model. Three case scenarios are tested through the paper, the first scenario includes four classes from the dataset, while the second scenario includes 3 classes and the third scenario includes two classes. All the scenarios include the COVID-19 class as it is the main target of this research to be detected. In the first scenario, the Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 80.6% in testing accuracy. In the second scenario, the Alexnet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 85.2% in testing accuracy, while in the third scenario which includes two classes (COVID-19, and normal), Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 100% in testing accuracy and 99.9% in the validation accuracy. All the performance measurement strengthens the obtained results through the research. © 2020 by the authors.","2019 novel coronavirus; Convolutional neural network; COVID-19; Deep transfer learning; GAN; Machine learning; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Symmetry",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084656133

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification. © 2020 Randhawa et al.

The role of dental professionals in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 is critically important. While all routine dental care has been suspended in countries experiencing COVID-19 disease during the period of pandemic, the need for organised urgent care delivered by teams provided with appropriate personal protective equipment takes priority. Dental professionals can also contribute to medical care. Major and rapid reorganisation of both clinical and support services is not straightforward. Dental professionals felt a moral duty to reduce routine care for fear of spreading COVID-19 among their patients and beyond, but were understandably concerned about the financial consequences.

Results: The average age of 273 COVID-19 patients enrolled with imaging progression were older than those without imaging progression (p = 0.006). The white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and acid glycoprotein were all decreased in imaging progression patients (all p < 0.05), and monocytes were increased (p = 0.025). The parameters including homocysteine, urea, creatinine and serum cystatin C were significantly higher in imaging progression patients (all p < 0.05), while eGFR decreased (p < 0.001). Monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was significantly higher in imaging progression patients compared to that in imaging progression-free ones (p < 0.001).

For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens’ privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens’ “personal data stores”, to be shared separately and selectively (e.g., with a backend system, but possibly also with other citizens), voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: It allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. The decentralized approach is also scalable to large populations, in that only the data of positive patients need be handled at a central level. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allowthe user to share spatio-temporal aggregates-if and when they want and for specific aims-with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longerterm pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society. © 2020, University of Skovde.

We found that NOx emissions in East China averaged during P2 decreased by 50% compared to those averaged during P1. The NOx emissions averaged during P3 increased by 26% compared to those during P2. Most provinces in East China gradually regained some of their NOx emissions after February 10, the official back-to-work day, but NOx emissions in most provinces have not yet to return to their previous levels in early January. NOx emissions in Wuhan, the first epicenter of COVID-19, had no sign of emission recovering by March 12. A few provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shanxi, have recovered fast, with their averaged NOx emissions during P3 almost back to pre-lockdown levels. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; COVID-19; GEOS-Chem; NOx emission; Satellite retrieval; WRF-GC","Emission control; Recovery; Control measures; East China; NOx emissions; Pollutant emission; Topdown; Zhejiang; Nitrogen oxides; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; emission control; nitrogen oxides; pollution control; respiratory disease; viral disease; China; Hubei; Wuhan",,"Atmosphere",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085248363

Based on the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the D2EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states. Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture. In the experiment part, we use the D2EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province. Fitting to the collected real data as non-linear optimization, the D2EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down.

One of the main differences between the proposed architecture and other ones is the methodology of information acquisition regarding the robot’s interlocutor. In order to obtain as much information as possible before the actual interaction took place, a custom Internet-of-Things-based sensor subsystems connected to Smart Infrastructure was designed and implemented, in order to support the interlocutor identification and acquisition of initial interaction parameters. The Artificial Intelligence interaction framework of the developed robotic system (including humanoid Pepper with its sensors and actuators, additional local, remote and cloud computing services) is being extended with the use of custom external subsystems for additional knowledge acquisition: device-based human identification, visual identification and audio-based interlocutor localization subsystems. These subsystems were deeply introduced and evaluated in this paper, presenting the benefits of integrating them into the robotic interaction system. In this paper a more detailed analysis of one of the external subsystems—Bluetooth Human Identification Smart Subsystem—was also included.

Respiratory illnesses are the third leading cause of death amongst the noncommunicable diseases. The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, also highlights the impact of communicable respiratory syndromes. In the clinical routine, prolonged postanesthetic respiratory instability worsens the patient outcome. Even though early and continuous, long-term cardiorespiratory monitoring has been proposed or even proven to be beneficial in several situations, implementations thereof are sparse. We employed our recently presented, multimodal patch stethoscope to estimate Einthoven electrocardiogram (ECG) Lead I and II from a single 55 mm ECG lead. Using the stethoscope and ECG subsystems, the pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET) were estimated. ECG-derived respiration techniques were used in conjunction with a novel, phonocardiogram-derived respiration approach to extract respiratory parameters. Medical-grade references were the SOMNOmedics SOMNO HD™ and Osypka ICON-Core™. In a study including 10 healthy subjects, we analyzed the performances in the supine, lateral, and prone position. Einthoven I and II estimations yielded correlations exceeding 0.97. LVET and PEP estimation errors were 10% and 21%, respectively. Respiratory rates were estimated with mean absolute errors below 1.2 bpm, and the respiratory signal yielded a correlation of 0.66. We conclude that the estimation of ECG, PEP, LVET, and respiratory parameters is feasible using a wearable, multimodal acquisition device and encourage further research in multimodal signal fusion for respiratory signal estimation. © 2020 by the authors.

In these situations, the wireless networks may become congested or completely disrupted and may not be adequate to support the traffic generated by rescuers. It is also considered as the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway. To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS). Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for packet reception rate and average delay quality of service (QoS) metrics. It is observed that the mechanisms implemented in a UAV-enabled LoRa network effectively help to improve the packet reception rate with nominal buffer delays. © 2020 by the authors.

Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.71, which determines whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that Re(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak. This shows that the government's timely establishment of hospitals and effective quarantine via quick detection prevent a larger outbreak. © 2020 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission and most people get infection easily, so the current main prevention method is interrupting the pathway of transmission. The dental treatments are very special because these operations produce substantial aerosols and lead a high risk of cross-infection, which brings challenge for epidemic prevention and control.

Clustered-Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), and CRISPR associated (Cas) protein (CRISPR/Cas) structures were first identified in E. coli in 1987 and guard prokaryotic cells from any invading pathogens, harmful events and plasmids by recognizing and cutting foreign nucleic acid sequences that contain short palindromic repeats spacer sequences. Several genome editing approaches have been developed based on these mechanisms; the most recent is known as CRISPR/Cas. Before the CRISPR technique was revealed in 2012, editing the genomes of plants and animals took many years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thus, CRISPR/Cas has attracted significant interest in the scientific community, especially for disease diagnosis and treatment, as it is quicker, less expensive and more precise than other genome editing approaches. The evidence from gene mutations in specific patients generated using CRISPR/Cas can assist in the prediction of the optimal treatment schedule for individual patients and for innovation purposes in other researches like replication in cell culture of coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2 or COVID-19). However, in numerous situations, the effects of the furthermost significant driver mutations are not yet understood and interpretation of the optimal treatment is impossible. CRISPR/Cas classifications feature highly sensitive and selective tools for the detection of various target genes. When we see the next steps of genomic research, it is obvious that genome-wide association studies are relatively new way to identify the genes involved in human disease. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas provides a tool to manipulate non-coding regions and will thus accelerate examination of these poorly characterized regions of the genome and play a vital role in the progress of whole genome libraries. Aim. We aimed to review the history of CRISPR/Cas, the mechanisms of CRISPR techniques, its current status as a tool for studying both natural mutations and genomic manipulations, and explore how CRISPR/Cas may improve the treatment of diseases. © 2020 Scienceline Publication.","COVID-19; CRISPR/Cas9; DNA-targeting; Genome sequencing; Palindromic; Plasmids; SARS-CoV2",,,"J.

However, in the 21st century, 2 highly pathogenic HCoVs-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality. In December 2019, yet another pathogenic HCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was recognized in Wuhan, China, and has caused serious illness and death. The ultimate cope and effect of this outbreak is unclear at present as the situation is rapidly evolving. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is zoonotic diseases causing severe respiratory illness emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Phylogenetic studies and viral sequencing results strongly suggest that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors after evolutionary recombination process, primarily in dromedary camels in Africa. The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, the identification of MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus from dromedary camels of Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula are the suggestive evidence for inter-transmission of the virus, primarily from camels to humans and its public health risks. However, the infection in camel is mostly asymptomatic. In contrast to the camel case, the clinical signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure with an overall mortality rate of about 35%. Though inter-human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV human cases, the virus is currently incapable of causing sustained human-to-human transmission (pandemic occurrence). Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine available for treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV. The important measures to control MERS-CoV spread are strict regulation of camel movement, regular herd screening and isolation of infected camels, use of personal protective equipment by camel handlers and awareness creation on the public where consumption of unpasteurized camel milk is common. Therefore, urgent global epidemiological studies are required, to understand the transmission patterns and the human cases of MERS-CoV and also for the proper implementation of the above-mentioned control measures. © 2020 Scienceline Publication.","Bats; Dipeptidyl peptidase 4; Dromedary camels; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; Transmission",,,"J.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial.

Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5. This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; creatine kinase; genomic RNA; glucocorticoid; lactate dehydrogenase; nucleotide; virus RNA; COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus RNA; disease prevalence; epidemiology; genome; hospital sector; infectious disease; phylogenetics; public health; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; uncertainty analysis; virus; adult; arterial gas; Article; Betacoronavirus; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; case report; chest tightness; China; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; Coronaviridae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; dizziness; fever; hepatitis; hospital admission; human; human cell; hypoxemia; male; metagenomics; nonhuman; noninvasive ventilation; nucleotide sequence; pain; phylogeny; physical examination; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory failure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequencing; RNA virus; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; tuberculosis; virus genome; virus identification; virus isolation; virus strain; weakness; classification; communicable disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; genetic recombination; genetics; lung; pathology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; whole genome sequencing; x-ray computed tomography; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Animalia; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; RNA viruses; Zika virus; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Genome, Viral; Humans; Lung; Male; Phylogeny; Pneumonia, Viral; Recombination, Genetic; RNA, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Whole Genome Sequencing","32015508","Nature",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081626097

Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model. Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection. More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

The 21st century appears no longer an exception, with the trend continued with escalated fear of SARS coronavirus in 2002 and further concern of influenza H5N1 in 2003. A novel influenza virus created the first pandemic of the 21st century, the pandemic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus, MERS-CoV in 2012. A novel coronavirus “SARS-CoV-2” (and the disease COVID-19) emerged suddenly, causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatality rate. This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out? Endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to infect naïve, as well as individual with pre-existing immunity. Continuous monitoring is strongly advisable, not only to the newly infected individuals, but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as re-infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; pre existing immunity; SARS; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antibiotic agent; antiinflammatory agent; corticosteroid; methylprednisolone; asymptomatic infection; case fatality rate; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; critically ill patient; endemic disease; epidemic; health care personnel; human; humoral immunity; immunopathogenesis; inflammation; intermediate host; migrant bird; nonhuman; pandemic influenza; patient monitoring; phylogeny; pneumonia; priority journal; reinfection; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus entry; virus genome; virus immunity; virus mutant; virus mutation; virus replication; virus strain; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; immunology; mortality; mutation; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virulence; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Endemic Diseases; Humans; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virulence","32282268","Crit.

Given the increasing caseload, there is an urgent need to augment clinical skills in order to identify from among the many mild cases the few that will progress to critical illness. We present a first step towards building an artificial intelligence (AI) framework, with predictive analytics (PA) capabilities applied to real patient data, to provide rapid clinical decision-making support. COVID-19 has presented a pressing need as a) clinicians are still developing clinical acumen to this novel disease and b) resource limitations in a surging pandemic require difficult resource allocation decisions. The objectives of this research are: (1) to algorithmically identify the combinations of clinical characteristics of COVID-19 that predict outcomes, and (2) to develop a tool with AI capabilities that will predict patients at risk for more severe illness on initial presentation. The predictive models learn from historical data to help predict who will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe outcome in COVID-19. Our results, based on data from two hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China, identified features on initial presentation with COVID-19 that were most predictive of later development of ARDS. A mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (a liver enzyme), the presence of myalgias (body aches), and an elevated hemoglobin (red blood cells), in this order, are the clinical features, on presentation, that are the most predictive. The predictive models that learned from historical data of patients from these two hospitals achieved 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting severe cases. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

Its cause was identified as a novel coronavirus, named provisionally 2019-nCoV. Subsequently, an official name was given as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) study group. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the Coronavirus disease-2019 as COVID-19. The epidemics of COVID-2019 have been recorded over 113 countries/territories/areas apart from China and filched more than 4,292 humans, affecting severely around 1,18,326 cases in a short span. The status of COVID-2019 emergency revised by the WHO within 42 days from Public Health International Emergency (January 30, 2020) to a pandemic (March 11, 2020). Nonetheless, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the current epidemic is on the rise (between 2-4%), relatively is lower than the previous SARS-CoV (2002/2003) and MERS-CoV (2012) outbreaks. Even though investigations are on its way, the researchers across the globe have assumptions of animal-origin of current SARS-CoV-2. A recent case report provides evidence of mild COVID-2019 infection in a pet dog that acquired COVID-2019 infection from his owner in Hong Kong. The news on travellers associated spread across the globe have also put many countries on alert with the cancellation of tourist visa to all affected countries and postponement of events where international visits were required. A few diagnostic approaches, including quantitative and differential real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, have been recommended for the screening of the individuals at risk. In the absence of any selective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, re-purposed drugs are advocated in many studies.

The disease caused by 2019-nCoV has been named as “coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19”. Due to the rising number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infected cases and widespread detection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced 2019-nCoV as a threatening health concern, and urgent robust actions are of supreme interest to tackle this global health emergency. Owing to this new emergence, we know relatively little about 2019-nCoV, which is a highly pathogenic human pathogen. To completely overcome this life-threatening 2019-nCoV pathogen, further in-depth studies are needed to gain insight and complete understanding about its fast mode spread, replication, and pathogenesis. Since the first appearance and detection of 2019-nCoV and COVID-19, respectively, the current literature lacks the global perspective and replication cycle of 2019-nCoV. Thus, herein, an effort has been made to cover this literature gap. A proper understanding of the 2019-nCoV replication will further insight and strengthen the infection control measures, transmission prevention, and vaccine development, effectively. © The Author(s) 2020.

In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods: Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results: Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation & conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health. This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research.","Bats; Coronavirus; India; Next-generation sequencing; Phylogenetic; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","envelope protein; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus spike protein; Article; bioinformatics; Coronavirinae; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; metagenomics; neighbor joining method; nonhuman; open reading frame; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; Pteropus; Pteropus medius; RdRp gene; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; Rousettus; Sanger sequencing; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus gene; animal; bat; classification; Coronavirinae; India; isolation and purification; virology; virus genome; Animals; Chiroptera; Coronavirus; Genome, Viral; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; India; Phylogeny; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","32317409","Indian J.

Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by travellers who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Studies suggested bats, as well as pangolins may be the vectors of both epidemics, prompting calls for a ban on eating wild animals. In fact, the country has already legislated against the consumption of legally protected and illegally sourced wild animals. Market survey found no bats for sale in those markets in 16 major Chinese megacities after SARS. Therefore, how did SARS-CoV and the new coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS2-CoV) spread from wild animals to humans? What lessons should we learn from these two epidemics? Besides a total ban on consumption wild animal meets from illegal source, I suggest to perfect the legislation of zoonosis and to fill the gaps in the laws concern with the prevention of zoonosis; to amend the provisions of the existing law governing the managing of zoonosis contaminated，areas. A permanent institution should be set up to cover the whole process of wildlife epidemic investigation and monitoring, human-wildlife interface, quarantine, immunization of susceptible populations, popularization of law and scientific knowledge, thus to realize early prevention, early detection and early treatment of zoonosis to ensure public health security. I also recommend that to establish a mechanism for the prevention and control of zoonosis, to identify wildlife hosts of zoonosis pathogens, to strengthen bat monitoring, and to issue red lines for the control of zoonosis. Additionally, we shall strengthen law enforcement to prevent zoonosis; improve animal production management, marketing, and quarantine procedures. I urge people to change their habit of pursuing fresh animal foods by killing animals on site in markets. © 2020, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Because approved drugs and vaccines are limited or not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are in high demand. To identify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days after diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days after diagnosis. Of these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC100 as low as 0.04 μg/mL, showing a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursor sequences were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals who were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic.

For each animal, rectal, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were taken. Swabs were submitted to RT-qPCR assays targeting 2 genes of SARS-CoV-2. All dogs were tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. One cat was tested positive by RT-qPCR on rectal swab. Nasopharyngeal swabs from this animal were tested negative. This cat showed mild respiratory and digestive signs. Serological analysis confirms the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in both serum samples taken 10 days apart. Genome sequence analysis revealed that the cat SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the phylogenetic clade A2a like most of the French human SARS-CoV-2.

Results: A total of eight donors were considered for enrollment; two of them were excluded because of ineligible routine check. Of the six remaining participants, five samples were tested weakly positive by the IgM ELISA. Meanwhile, high titers of IgG were observed in five samples. The patient treated with CP did not require mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion, and was then transferred to a general ward. Conclusions: Our serological findings in convalescent plasma from recovered patients may help facilitate understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish CP donor screening protocol in COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies including IgM and IgG were measured by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in convalescent plasma from six donors who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nanjing, China.

There is a diverse range of SARS-CoV-2 detection rates in reported studies, with uncertainty as to the optimal sampling strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing respiratory sampling strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed at least two respiratory sampling sites (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum) in participants with COVID-19. The percentage positive tests were compared between sampling modalities by constructing a Z-test assuming independence and using the standard errors obtained from the random effects meta-analysis. Findings: From 1039 total studies, we identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, with SARS-CoV-2 testing results from a total of 3442 respiratory tract specimens. Compared to nasopharyngeal swab sampling, sputum testing resulted in significantly higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection while oropharyngeal swab testing had lower rates of viral RNA detection. Earlier sampling after symptom onset was associated with improved detection rates, but the differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by sampling method was consistent regardless of the duration of symptoms. Interpretation: The results support sputum sampling as a valuable method of COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring, and highlight the importance of early testing after symptom onset to increase the rates of COVID-19 diagnosis.

Such emerging pathogens should be considered as a high threat to humans, animals, and environmental health. The year 2020 was welcomed by another significant virus from family Coronaviridae called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Within a short time, this disease attained the status of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Presently, COVID-19 has spread to more than 150 countries, therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic. The Chinese government, along with WHO, other health agencies, and many nations, are monitoring the current situation closely to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on humans, animals, and environmental health. In the context of the current situation, biosafety and biosecurity measure that focus on One Health aspects of the disease outbreaks and the SARS-CoV-2 spread are of great importance to restrain this pathogen.

Unfortunately, false negative test results are often reported. In this study, we attempted to determine the principal causes leading to false negative results of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in respiratory tract specimens. Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%–95.26%) and specificity (83.72%–98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified. Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality. In addition, our results demonstrated that false negativity accounted for a vast majority of contradicting results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA test by RT-PCR. © 2020, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS.","COVID-19; False negative results; Internal reference; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Virol.

Being a potent oxidant, ozone is lethal against most bacteria and viruses found in water, or on surfaces and aerosols. Ozone has also been successfully used to treat several viral diseases such as Ebola and HIV Hepatitis B and C. Using molecular modeling, this study evaluated the reactivity of ozone toward representative key molecules in the structure of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that ozone is able to attack the proteins and lipids of the virus’s spikes and envelope, particularly the amino acids tryptophan, methionine and cysteine, and the fatty acids, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid. Ozone also attacks the N-glycopeptides of the spike protein subunits 1 and 2, though at lower reactivity. Disruption of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 could inactivate the virus, suggesting that ozone could be an effective oxidant against COVID-19 virus. If incorrectly applied, ozone is toxic and contact with the respiratory tract must be avoided. © 2020 International Ozone Association.","coronavirus; COVID-19; Ozone; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome","Amino acids; Linoleic acid; Oxidants; Ozone; Proteins; Viruses; Arachidonic acids; Glycopeptides; Hepatitis B; Respiratory tract; Spike protein; Viral disease; Diseases",,"Ozone Sci.

It remained to be determined why diabetic individuals with uncontrolled glucose levels are more prone to develop the severe form of COVID-19. The molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and what determines the onset of the cytokine storm found in severe COVID-19 patients are unknown. Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication. The infection triggers mitochondrial ROS production, which induces stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and consequently promotes glycolysis. HIF-1α-induced changes in monocyte metabolism by SARS-CoV-2 infection directly inhibit T cell response and reduce epithelial cell survival. Targeting HIF-1ɑ may have great therapeutic potential for the development of novel drugs to treat COVID-19. Diabetic people with uncontrolled blood glucose levels have a greater risk to develop severe COVID-19 disease.

COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, currently recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates and are unable to identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting in patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of targeted amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, herein, nanopore targeted sequencing (NTS) is developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6–10 h, with a limit of detection of ten standard plasmid copies per reaction. Compared with its specificity for five common respiratory viruses, the specificity of NTS for SARS-CoV-2 reaches 100%. Parallel testing with approved real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kits for SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases show that NTS identifies more infected patients (22/61) as positive, while also effectively monitoring for mutated nucleic acid sequences, categorizing types of SARS-CoV-2, and detecting other respiratory viruses in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses and pathogens. © 2020 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L–1 air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable (‘live’), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample. The complete SAR-CoV-2 genomic sequence was nevertheless determined by Sanger sequencing and most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously described in Georgia, USA. Results of this study illustrate the feasibility of tracking progression of the COVID-19 pandemic using environmental aerosol samples instead of human specimens. Collection of a positive sample from a distance more than 2 m away from the nearest patient traffic implies the virus was in an aerosol. © The Author(s).","Aerosol; Air sampling; COVID-19","Aerosols; Cell culture; Genes; Health care; Viruses; Cytopathic effect; Direct sequencing; Environmental aerosols; Function of time; Genomic sequence; Post inoculation; Sanger sequencing; University students; Diseases; air sampling; genomics; health care; student; university sector; virus; Georgia; United States; SARS coronavirus",,"Aerosol Air Qual.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for devising more efficient preventive measures, to limit the spread of the infection until an effective treatment or vaccine is available. The preventive measures depend mainly on the understanding of the transmission routes of this virus, its environmental stability, and its persistence on common touch surfaces. Due to the very limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, we can speculate its stability in the light of previous studies conducted on other human and animal coronaviruses. In this review, we present the available data on the stability of coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, from previous reports to help understand its environmental survival. According to available data, possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested. SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal CoVs have remarkably short persistence on copper, latex and surfaces with low porosity as compared to other surfaces like stainless steel, plastics, glass and highly porous fabrics. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with diarrhoea and that it is shed in the faeces of COVID-19 patients. Some CoVs show persistence in human excrement, sewage and waters for a few days. These findings suggest a possible risk of faecal–oral, foodborne and waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries that often use sewage-polluted waters in irrigation and have poor water treatment systems. CoVs survive longer in the environment at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity. It has been suggested that large numbers of COVID-19 cases are associated with cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and that seasonality of the virus spread is suspected. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","animal coronaviruses; common touch surfaces; COVID-19; environmental conditions; fomites; human coronaviruses; inanimate surfaces; persistence; SARS-CoV-2; stability; survivability; virus survival",,"32603505","Transboundary Emer.

There is a growing body of reports indicating that COVID-19 patients, especially those in severe condition, exhibit neurological symptoms, thus supporting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could infect and damage neurons within the central nervous system in humans. Using human pluripotent stem cells-derived neurons, here we show the expression of ACE2 in human neurons via immunocytochemistry.

Twelve patients at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were selected on February 13, 2020 and throat swabs were taken. The swabs were stored at room temperature (20–25°C), then divided into aliquots and subjected to different temperature for different periods in order to inactivate the viruses (56°C for 30, 45, 60 min; 65, 70, 80°C for 10, 15, 20 min). Control aliquots were stored at room temperature for 60 min. Then all aliquots were tested in a real-time fluorescence PCR using primers against SARS-CoV-2. Regardless of inactivation temperature and time, 7 of 12 cases (58.3%) tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and cycle threshold values were similar. These results suggest that virus inactivation parameters exert minimal influence on PCR test results.

Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shares the same cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 deaths showed that the lungs had characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type-specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide a route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and in mice treated by lipopolysaccharide. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream.

Methods: We collected biological samples from 10% of the rhesus macaque population for systematic testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-PCR and host antibody response by ELISA. Testing required the development and validation of new assays and an algorithm using in laboratory-developed and commercially available reagents and protocols. Results and Conclusions: No SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antibody was detected in this study; therefore, we have proposed a modified testing algorithm for sentinel surveillance to monitor for any future transmissions.

One key requirement to safely transition out of lockdown is the continuous testing of the population to identify infected subjects. Currently, detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, thus requiring dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on reverse transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This protocol is applied directly to SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared the results to those obtained using the standard method. We further succeeded in applying the protocol to self-collected saliva samples from confirmed cases. Since the proposed protocol can detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva and provides on-the-spot results, it allows simple and continuous surveillance of the community. Impact statement: Humanity is currently experiencing a global pandemic with devastating implications on human health and the economy. Most countries are gradually exiting their lockdown state. We are currently lacking rapid and simple viral detections, especially methods that can be performed in the household. Here, we applied RT-LAMP directly on human clinical swabs and self-collected saliva samples. We adjusted the method to allow simple and rapid viral detection, with no RNA purification steps. By testing our method on over 180 human samples, we determined its sensitivity, and by applying it to other viruses, we determined its specificity. We believe this method has a promising potential to be applied world-wide as a simple and cheap surveillance test for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","Covid-19; Molecular; pandemic; RT-LAMP; SARS-CoV-2; surveillance",,"32668983","Exp.

We generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in SARS CoV-2 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans. Our results show that among the genomes analyzed, two sequence regions in the N-terminal domain “MESEFR” and “SYLTPG” are specific to human SARS CoV-2. In the receptor-binding domain, two sequence regions “VGGNY“ and ”EIYQAGSTPCNGV” and a disulfide bridge connecting 480C and 488C in the extended loop are structural determinants for the recognition of human ACE-2 receptor. The complete genome analysis of representative SARS CoVs from bat, civet, human host sources, and human SARS CoV-2 identified the bat genome (GenBank code: MN996532.1) as closest to the recent novel human SARS CoV-2 genomes. The bat SARS CoV genomes (GenBank codes: MG772933 and MG772934) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression toward becoming human SARS CoV-2. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","complete genomes; multiple sequence alignment; phylogenetic tree; receptor-binding domain; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; spike proteins",,"32543705","Proteins Struct.

In this context, the present study employed an in silico approach to assess the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS analysis of twelve Clerodendrum species against the imperative spike protein, main protease enzyme Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the phytocompounds at the active binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals taraxerol, friedelin and stigmasterol. Decent physicochemical attributes of the compounds in accordance with Lipinski’s rule of five and Veber’s rule further established them as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy estimation revealed that taraxerol was the most promising candidate displaying the highest binding efficacy with all the concerned SARS-CoV-2 proteins included in the present analysis. Our observations were supported by robust molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of the viral proteins with taraxerol for a timescale of 40 nanoseconds. It was striking to note that taraxerol exhibited better binding energy scores with the concerned viral proteins than the drugs that are specifically targeted against them. The present results promise to provide new avenues to further evaluate the potential of the phytocompound taraxerol in vitro and in vivo towards its successful deployment as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor and combat the catastrophic COVID-19.

Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed.

Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple non-neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease.

Most human CoVs have recently attracted global attention to their lethal potential and great infectious capacity. A highly pathogenic CoV, called COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, dramatically emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This new CoV has caused severe pneumonia in China and rapidly spreads around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing evidence pieces show that viruses, such as CoVs, can enter the central nervous system from different pathways and inducing neurotoxicity. Therefore, it is urgent to make clear whether SARS-CoV-2 has access to the central nervous system and can cause direct neuronal effects. Moreover, a brain–lung–brain axis is been proposed from the scientific community where severe neurological dysfunction and injury are associated with lung injury, and vice versa. In this axis, virus-induced inflammation and oxidative stress could be the common mechanisms responsible for CoV neurological symptoms. Therefore, is important to make clear whether SARS-CoV-2 lung damage can cause direct or indirect neuronal effects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society","Brain–lung–brain axis; Central nervous system; Coronaviruses; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Neurosci.

Moreover, the high mutation rate of this virus heavily affects the understanding of its evolution and diffusion mechanisms, and, in turn, the development of effective solutions. In this study, two novel algorithms are provided for finding out recurrent patterns of nucleotide subsequences of different SARS-CoV-2 genomes as a unique signature capable of identifying the most peculiar features of the pathogen. In particular, we provide several subsequence patterns related to the Spike glycoprotein, which is believed to be the main target for developing effective drugs and vaccines against the COVID-19 disease because of its role in the entrance of coronaviruses into host cells. The experimental results, obtained by analyzing 5000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2, have shown that the extracted patterns are able to recognize the Spyke protein in the 99.35% of the considered genomes. In addition, such patterns have proven to be highly discriminating with respect to other pathogenic genomes, such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Nipah, and the streptococcus bacteria.

The objective of this study was to standardize lower cost molecular methods for SARS-CoV-2 identification. E gene primers previously determined for TaqMan assays by Colman et al. (2020) were adapted in SYBR Green assay and RT-PCR conventional. The cross-reactivity test was performed with 17 positive samples for other respiratory viruses, and the sensibility test was performed with 8 dilutions (10 based) of SARS-CoV-2 isolated and 63 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. The SYBR Green assays and conventional RT-PCR have not shown amplification of the 17 respiratory samples positives for other viruses. The SYBR Green-based assay was able to detect all 8 dilutions of the isolate. The conventional PCR detected until 107 dilution, both assays detected the majority of the 63 samples, 98.42% of positivity in SYBR Green, and 93% in conventional PCR. The average Ct variation between SYBR Green and TaqMan was 1.92 and the highest Ct detected by conventional PCR was 35.98. Both of the proposed assays are less sensitive than the current gold standard; however, our data shows a low sensibility variation, suggesting that these methods could be used by laboratories as a lower cost molecular method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.","Conventional PCR; COVID-19 pandemic; Molecular diagnoses; SARS-CoV-2; SYBR Green assay",,,"Braz.

No proven effective therapies or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. The rapidly increasing research regarding COVID-19 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Remdesivir may be the most promising therapy up till now.

To date, there are no proven effective therapies for this virus. Efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 are underway. Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, predispose patients to co-infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality. Numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). Although antibiotics do not directly affect SARS-CoV-2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that some patients die from bacterial co-infection rather than virus itself. To date, a considerable number of bacterial strains have been resistant to various antibiotics such as azithromycin, and the overuse could render those or other antibiotics even less effective. Therefore, bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection are considered critical risk factors for the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19. Also, the antibiotic-resistant as a result of overusing must be considered. In this review, we will summarize the bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection in some featured respiratory viral infections, especially COVID-19. © 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","antibiotic; bacterial co-infection; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; viral infection",,,"IUBMB Life",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089064242

The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3). RESULTS: Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other. Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.",,"riboflavin; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; blood analysis; blood transfusion; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; growth, development and aging; human; pandemic; passive immunization; plasma; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; virology; virus load; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Blood Chemical Analysis; Blood Transfusion; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Riboflavin; RNA, Viral; Ultraviolet Rays; Viral Load","32470046","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085905531

The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is also evidence of transmission through aerosols and digestive tracts. Because orthodontic treatment involves a large population who need routine return-visits, it was significantly affected and suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of the dental clinics and hospitals. Although the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China, and many areas have gradually resumed work and classes, orthodontic participants are still under high risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the fact that the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or patients in the incubation period may cause the cross-infection between orthodontic practitioners and patients. The close proximity between the practitioners and the patients, and the generation of droplets and aerosols that contain saliva and blood during treatment further increase the risks of transmission.

In this study, our approach integrates different ligand based drug design strategies of some in-house chemicals. The study design was composed of some major aspects: (a) classification QSAR based data mining of diverse SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitors, (b) QSAR based virtual screening (VS) to identify in-house molecules that could be effective against putative target SARS-CoV PLpro and (c) finally validation of hits through receptor-ligand interaction analysis. This approach could be used to aid in the process of COVID-19 drug discovery. It will introduce key concepts, set the stage for QSAR based screening of active molecules against putative SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme.

Methods: In this unmatched 1:1 case-control study, blood samples from 46 real-time RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized cases and 45 healthy donors (negative controls) were studied. Diagnostic accuracy of the IgG RDT was assessed against both an in-house recombinant spike-expressing immunofluorescence assay (rIFA), as an established reference method (primary endpoint), and the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (secondary endpoint). Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male (61% vs 20%; P =.0001) and older (median 66 vs 47 years old; P <.001) than controls. Whole blood IgG-RDT results showed 86% and 93% overall Kendall concordance with rIFA and IgG ELISA, respectively. IgG RDT performances were similar between plasma and whole blood. Overall, RDT sensitivity was 88% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 70-96), specificity 98% (95%CI: 90-100), PPV 97% (95%CI: 80-100) and NPV 94% (95%CI: 84-98).

A better understanding of B- and T-cell immunity is critical to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A cohort of 129 patients with COVID-19 and 20 suspected cases were enrolled in this study, and a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) and a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (MCLIA) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG detection. Additionally, 127 patients with COVID-19 were selected for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate B-cell immunity, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were quantified in 95 patients with COVID-19 to evaluate T-cell immunity. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays for detecting SARS-CoV infection were > 90%, comparable with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detection. IgM antibody levels peaked on day 13 and began to fall on day 21, while IgG antibody levels peaked on day 17 and were maintained until tracking ended. Lymphocyte and subset enumeration suggested that lymphocytopenia occurred in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays can indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection, which elicits an antibody response. Lymphocytopenia occurs in patients with COVID-19, which possibly weakens the T-cell response. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,"32710269","Mol. Diagn.

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lung infection, gastrointestinal symptoms described in COVID-19 patients and detection of the viral RNA in feces of infected patients drove attentions to a possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. However, not only the viral RNA but also the infectious viral particles are required for the viral infection and no proof has been demonstrated the transmission of the infectious virus particles via the fecal-oral route yet. Growing evidence indicates the crosstalk between gut microbiota and lung, that maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system. This gut-lung interaction may influence the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Severity of COVID-19 has mostly associated with old ages and underlying medical conditions. Since the diversity in the gut microbiota decreases during aging, dysbiosis could be the reason for older adults being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. We believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of COVID-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota results in gut permeability leading to secondary infection and multiple organ failure. Conversely, disruption of the gut barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may lead to translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from the lung into the intestinal lumen via circulatory and lymphatic system. This review points out the role of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota involving in sepsis, on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, this review aims to clarify the ambiguity in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. © TÜBİTAK.","COVID-19; Dysbiosis; Gut permeability; Gut-lung axis",,,"Turk. J.

To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which packages viral RNA into new virions. We determined a 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of this protein's N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer similar to that of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. While the N2b domain forms a dimer in solution, addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a homotetramer. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an α-helix that self-associates and cooperates with the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of amino acid substitutions in the N protein from over 38,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We find that these substitutions are strongly clustered in the protein's N2a linker domain, and that substitutions within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, with implications for both drug design and antibody-based testing. © 2020 The Protein Society","coronavirus; COVID-19; crystal structure; nucleocapsid; SARS-CoV-2",,"32654247","Protein Sci.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089064168

Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues. In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed. It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19. In conclusion, this review may provide useful information in developing some promising strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of −87.01 ± 5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds. In conclusion, our study suggests that Withanoside V in Ashwagandha may be serve as a potential inhibitor against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 and may have an antiviral effect on nCoV.

Since the initial outbreak in China on December 2019, the international scientific community joined efforts in an unprecedent public health battle. In late May 2020, 5 204 508 cases and 337 687 deaths have been reported by World Health Organization, with higher number of cases in Europe and Americas. SARS-CoV-2 was described as a novel variant from the coronavirus family and its genome was sequenced within a few months while COVID 19 quickly spread worldwide. The main cell receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) was identified as involved in the invasion of host cells. As a result of the findings from cell biology, immunology and clinical studies, the pathogenesis of the virus started to be understood but it has been not fully elucidated so far. While a massive effort for the development of a vaccine is on course, preventive protocols for infection control have been proposed. Many studies on the discovering of effective therapeutic protocols have been developed, particularly on the redirection of already approved substances, but no gold standard treatment was established until now. An overview on the envisioned socioeconomic and politic impacts suggest that our society will be transformed after COVID 19 pandemia. As a result, deep changes in science, politics, socioeconomic and healthcare priorities shall appear in post-pandemia agenda. © 2020, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Institute of Science and Technology of Sao Jose dos Campos.

Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. Methods: Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. Results: We found that the freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18 ~ 25 °C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37 °C and 56 °C, respectively. Conclusion: The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories. © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists","COVID-19; Freeze-drying; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","Cold storage; Diagnosis; Moisture; Reagents; Freeze drying; Karl Fischer Titration; Logistics network; Low temperatures; Residual moisture; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Storage spaces; Transport networks; Diseases",,"J.

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. METHODS: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs ® 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress ® SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs ® 480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs ® 480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media.

However, their application is limited in countries that lack sufficient resources to handle large-scale testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and machine learning analysis. This approach uses equipment and expertise commonly found in clinical laboratories in developing countries. We obtained mass spectra from a total of 362 samples (211 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 151 negative by RT–PCR) without prior sample preparation from three different laboratories. We tested two feature selection methods and six machine learning approaches to identify the top performing analysis approaches and determine the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The support vector machine model provided the highest accuracy (93.9%), with 7% false positives and 5% false negatives. Our results suggest that MALDI-MS and machine learning analysis can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab samples. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"Desorption; Developing countries; Mass spectrometry; Support vector machines; Analysis approach; False negatives; Feature selection methods; Large scale testing; Machine learning approaches; Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; Sample preparation; Support vector machine models; Learning systems; article; clinical laboratory; developing country; false negative result; false positive result; feature selection; human; major clinical study; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; nonhuman; nose smear; polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; support vector machine",,"Nat.

Development of effective vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection will be aided by a molecular-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their interactions with host cell proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly homologous to the N protein of SARS-CoV, which is essential for viral RNA replication and packaging into new virions. Emerging models indicate that nucleocapsid proteins of other viruses can form biomolecular condensates to spatiotemporally regulate N protein localization and function. Our bioinformatic analyses, in combination with pre-existing experimental evidence, suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is capable of forming or regulating biomolecular condensates in vivo by interaction with RNA and key host cell proteins. We discuss multiple models, whereby the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may harness this activity to regulate viral life cycle and host cell response to viral infection. © 2020 The Authors.

However, little is currently known about the biology of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes polyproteins, four structural proteins and six accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of various mammals. The imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor pathway in the renin-angiotensin system leads to multi-system inflammation. The early symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough and fatigue. Vigilant screening is important. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Isolation and quarantine of suspected cases is recommended.

Process management through Good Farming Practices for animal production and Animal Welfare should be important preventive measures to avoid this contagion. In coronaviruses and Ebola there are ancestral hosts (such as bats) and intermediate hosts (such as Civettictis civetta or Paradoxurus hermaphroditus for SARS-CoV-1, dromedaries for MERS-CoV, and snakes and Manis javanica for SARS-CoV-2). In its natural state the inter-specie jump would take much longer to occur; however, the existence of wet markets, where animals are traded, would have allowed viruses to find a new host in humans. In addition to pneumonia, the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 produces temporary discomfort, such as diarrhea, due to the abundance of the ACE-2 receptor in both lung cells and enterocytes, where its replication would increase the probability of transmission by the fecal-oral route. This risk could be minimized by improving Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) procedures in the food industry. Future research should clarify the relationship between viruses and their hosts, as well as the effect of climate change and proteins availability for human consumption, on these pandemics. © 2020 All rights reserved.","Animal welfare; COVID-19; Domestic animals; Food safety; Good livestock practices; Good manufacturing practices; Wet markets",,,"Scientia Agropecu.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087442668

A list of such epitopes is provided. The number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus. For inducing protection, booster vaccinations enhancing existing immunity are less demanding than primary vaccinations against new antigens.

The first prospective study consisted of 75 patients with COVID-19 who were ready for discharge and who had 2 consecutive negative results per nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of viral samples retrieved with nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs). Because of detection of potential false negatives in that cohort, the NAAT results of paired OS and NPS samples from 50 additional recruits with COVID-19 during their recovery stage were used in a second prospective study to compare the diagnostic values of the 2 viral RNA sampling methods. For identification of the frequency of inconsistency between the sampling methods, the McNemar’s test was used for difference analysis and the kappa statistic for consistency analysis. OSs obtained from 2 of the 75 participants in the first study yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Both were male and aged >60 y. Subsequent chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays indicated that they were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. For parallel NAAT of OS and NPS samples in the second study, McNemar’s test indicated that the difference between the frequencies of inconsistent parts of OS and NPS was statistically significant (P = 0.021). Cohen’s kappa coefficient for OS and NPS was 0.244, which is indicative of fair consistency. The NPS test has a risk of sending home more patients (59%) who still have the infection, while the OS test will make such an error in fewer patients (14%). Although OS sampling improves the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing, it has to be emphasized that this conclusion is based on a very small sample size.

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a prelude to viral entry into the cell. Using a naive llama single-domain antibody library and PCR-based maturation, we have produced two closely related nanobodies, H11-D4 and H11-H4, that bind RBD (KD of 39 and 12 nM, respectively) and block its interaction with ACE2. Single-particle cryo-EM revealed that both nanobodies bind to all three RBDs in the spike trimer. Crystal structures of each nanobody–RBD complex revealed how both nanobodies recognize the same epitope, which partly overlaps with the ACE2 binding surface, explaining the blocking of the RBD–ACE2 interaction. Nanobody-Fc fusions showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (4–6 nM for H11-H4, 18 nM for H11-D4) and additive neutralization with the SARS-CoV-1/2 antibody CR3022. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,,"Nat.

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Central nervous system; Nasal cavity; Olfaction; Respiratory virus; SARS",,"32629042","Brain Behav.

The causative agent was identified as the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and was named SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 2). By 16 April the virus had spread to 185 different countries, infected over 2,000,000 people and resulted in over 130,000 deaths3. In the Netherlands, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was notified on 27 February. The outbreak started with several different introductory events from Italy, Austria, Germany and France followed by local amplification in, and later also outside, the south of the Netherlands. The combination of near to real-time whole-genome sequence analysis and epidemiology resulted in reliable assessments of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community, facilitating early decision-making to control local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands.

The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through ‘Virtual Work Flow’ (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

Fortunately, there are no reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in dental practices. Dental professionals were advised only to treat dental emergencies, and such cases were screened via telephone to maintain social distancing. Nevertheless, new protocols and measures are needed as dental professionals return to normal practice after weeks of confinement in many countries.

Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID-19. Nonstructural protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development. We have performed in silico based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID-19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules. Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia, respectively, were selected as stronger binder of EndoU. Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250, and Lys290. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU. The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be –141±11 and –136±16kJ/mol, respectively. The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2µM and 30µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin, respectively. Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than to uridine monophosphate (UMP). Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å2 by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide. However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

Coronavirus was not thought to be a significant problem in humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, but infections in animals, including pigs, cats, dogs, and poultry, have been problematic for a long time. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, drew special attention towards this virus once again. The intermediate host of this novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is yet to be determined, but it has a very close genomic relationship with the bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV), RaTG13 strain, and the pangolin coronaviruses. As veterinary medicine has a long-term experience dealing with coronaviruses, this could be helpful in better understanding and detecting the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and drive human medicine towards the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs through the collaborative and transdisciplinary approaches of One Health. © 2020, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

Like the other viruses belonging to the same family of coronaviruses, it can cause from mild flu-like symptoms, such as cold, sore throat, cough and fever, to more severe ones such as pneumonia and breathing difficulties, and it can even lead to death. Since no effective specific drug therapy has been found yet, nor any vaccine capable of limiting the spread of this pathogen, it is important for ways of preventing the spread of this infection to be established. The purpose of our research was to provide a protocol to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in light of the limited information related to this coronavirus. In detail, we analysed and searched targeted evidence-based guidelines issued in the various countries affected by this epidemic up till now. In addition, we analyzed the recommendations for the prevention and control of other epidemics caused by other pathogens belonging to the same family of coronaviruses or others that present the same mechanisms of transmission. General organizational measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency of COVID-19 have been imposed by the competent authorities for an adequate and proportionate management of the evolution of the epidemiological situation. The prevention and protection organizational measures therefore aim to minimize the probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, measures must also be taken at work to avoid new infections or even the spread of the virus where it has already been present. Furthermore, environmental measures are aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to individuals through contact with infected subjects, objects, equipment, or contaminated environmental surfaces. Protective devices must be used whenever there is potentially close contact with a suspect case, especially when the potentially infected person does not wear a surgical mask that could reduce the spread of viruses in the environment. By adopting this specific prevention and protection measures recommended in the workplace, it will be possible to help overcome this COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerosol; Competitive sport; Coronavirus; COVID-19; DPI; Droplets; Environmental measures; Fatigue; Gloves; Inanimate surface; Infection; Mask; Occupational medicine; Organizational measures; Pandemic; PPE; Prevention; Protection; Protocol; SARS-CoV-2; Stress; Transmission; Work","containment; disease control; disease spread; disease transmission; epidemic; epidemiology; pathogen; pneumonia; spatiotemporal analysis; symptom; viral disease; virus; workplace; China; Hubei; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084478537

As of now, there is not enough testing capacity in the world to meet the stated testing targets, which are expected to skyrocket globally for broader testing during reopening Aim: This review focuses on the development of lab-on-chip biosensing platforms for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Results: We discuss advantages of utilizing lab-on-chip technologies in response to the current global pandemic, including their potential for low-cost, rapid sample-to-answer processing times, and ease of integration into a range of healthcare settings. We then highlight the development of magnetic, colorimetric, plasmonic, electrical, and lateral flow-based lab-on-chip technologies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to other viruses. We focus on rapid, point-of-care technologies that can be deployed at scale, as such devices could be promising alternatives to the current gold standard of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic testing.

The study accounts for potentially spatial confounding factors related to urbanization that may have influenced the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 mortality. Our epidemiological analysis uses geographical information (e.g., municipalities) and negative binomial regression to assess whether both ambient PM2.5 concentration and excess mortality have a similar spatial distribution. Our analysis suggests a positive association of ambient PM2.5 concentration on excess mortality in Northern Italy related to the COVID-19 epidemic.

Materials and Methods: Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations. Results: Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes. The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel. Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications. Conclusions: During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities. Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage. Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol. © 2020 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.","COVID-19; Dentistry; Orthodontic emergency; Orthodontics; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Angle Orthod.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084753660

Physical properties of surfaces and spike-glycoprotein are correlated with the reported stability of SARS-CoV-2. The spike-protein is reported to be hydrophobic in nature with an isoelectric point of 5.9. Hence surface with both positive charge and hydrophobic groups are expected to achieve a strong binding with the surface spike-protein. Various surface engineering strategies of polypropylene and other materials with hybrid self-assembled monolayers and dopamine are discussed to design the mixed hydrophobic and charged surfaces.

In India, suspected cases were screened for SARS-CoV-2 as per the advisory of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. Methods: Throat swab/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B-and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. Results: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. Interpretation & conclusions: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B-and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the sequences of new cases from India and the other affected countries would be vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of substitution of the SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.","Epitopegenomes; India; Kerala; next-generation sequencing; phylogeny; real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","biologic factors and agents acting on the immune system; cell antigen; epitope; gamma interferon; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus RNA; virus spike protein; antigenicity; Article; artificial neural network; Betacoronavirus; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; E gene; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic heterogeneity; high throughput sequencing; hospitalization; human; immune response; India; machine learning; major histocompatibility complex; N gene; nose smear; open reading frame; phylogeny; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SARS coronavirus; sea food; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; support vector machine; throat culture; virus characterization; virus detection; virus gene; virus genome; virus transmission; whole genome sequencing",,"Indian J.

This study aims to summarize the key points and supply suggestions on screening paediatric COVID-19 patients more appropriately. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively included paediatric patients who have accepted SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (30 January 2020 to 13 February 2020) and compared them with paediatric-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Besides, a review was carried out by analysing all current literature about laboratory-confirmed paediatric cases with COVID-19. Results: There were 46 suspected cases included in the descriptive study. The results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were all negative. Compared with paediatric-confirmed cases, the incidence of epidemic history was lower in suspected cases (P <.001). The rate of fever (P <.001), cough (P <.001), headache or dizziness (P <.001), vomiting (P <.001) and abdominal discomfort or distention (P =.01) were more observed in the included suspected children. There were more children having decreased WBC count in the confirmed group. In the literature review, twenty-nine studies were obtained with 488 paediatric COVID-19 cases. 88.6% of them had epidemiological history. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms. Compared with older patients, the incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, lethargy and headache or dizziness was lower, while gastrointestinal symptoms were reported more. Conclusions: Children with a history of close contact with confirmed cases, manifested as cough and fever should be paid more attention to after excluding infection of other common pathogens. Atypical symptoms should not be over-emphasized in screening paediatric COVID-19. More studies are needed for guiding efficient recognition in paediatric COVID-19. © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

This systemic involvement is postulated to be mainly related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors located on several different human cells. Lung involvement is the most common serious manifestation of the disease, ranging from asymptomatic disease or mild pneumonia, to severe disease associated with hypoxia, critical disease associated with shock, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure or death. Among patients with COVID-19, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and especially cardiovascular disease, has been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas the emergence of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias, has been associated with poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also frequently encountered and may persist for several days. Haematological complications are frequent as well and have been associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, recent studies have reported that over a third of infected patients develop a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscles, including anosmia and ageusia. The skin, the kidneys, the liver, the endocrine organs and the eyes are also affected by the systemic COVID-19 disease.

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice-at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation & conclusions: Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.","COVID-19; diagnosis; preparedness; quality control; quarantine; severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2; Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory","adolescent; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; female; human; India; infant; laboratory technique; male; mass screening; middle aged; organization and management; pandemic; preschool child; quality control; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; specimen handling; virus pneumonia; young adult; Article; clinical laboratory; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; disease transmission; dyspnea; epidemic; fever; health care organization; health care policy; high throughput sequencing; laboratory diagnosis; N gene; ORF-1b gene; quarantine; RdRp gene; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sampling; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; standardization; symptomatology; virus culture; virus gene; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality Control; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Specimen Handling; Young Adult","32242875","Indian J.

The scientific effort to understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical impact has been huge, and important achievements are highlighted in this review. Diagnosis is central and is the first step in recognizing and fighting any infectious agent. Instrumental to that is the quality of the data, relying on serological and molecular surveys in addition to trustworthy clinical records. However, the fast spread of a virus adapted for human-to-human respiratory transmission raised a demand for millions of molecular tests that are simply not available. Several candidate drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials. Those with an already recognized safety profile are more auspicious, since, if proven effective, can cut several steps of production and phase 2 and 3 trials. More than one hundred vaccine prototypes are in different stages of development, however, safety and efficacy evaluations cannot be obviated, implicating, most optimistically, in at least months for us to have an effective immunization, the definite measure to allow a safe return to the pre-pandemic lifestyle. Science has never been more necessary and present in daily life.

However, the correlation between the immune infiltration and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility or severity in cancer patients remains to be fully elucidated. ACE2 expressions in normal tissues, cancers and cell lines were comprehensively assessed. Furthermore, we compared ACE2 expression between cancers and matched normal tissues through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). In addition, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate the related signaling pathways. Finally, the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune infiltration were investigated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and GEPIA. We found that ACE2 was predominantly expressed in both adult and fetal tissues from the digestive, urinary and male reproductive tracts; moreover, ACE2 expressions in corresponding cancers were generally higher than that in matched healthy tissues. GSEA showed that various metabolic and immune-related pathways were significantly associated with ACE2 expression across multiple cancer types. Intriguingly, we found that ACE2 expression correlated significantly with immune cell infiltration in both normal and cancer tissues, especially in the stomach and colon. These findings proposed a possible fecal-oral and maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that cancers of the respiratory, digestive or urinary tracts would be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. © The author(s).","ACE2; Cancer; COVID-19; Immune infiltration",,"32760213","Int.

Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARSCoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways.

This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in pathology and mortality. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives changes in immune cell-derived factors that then interact with receptors expressed by the sensory neuronal innervation of the lung to further promote important aspects of disease severity, including ARDS. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions.

Patients infected with the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 are placed in quarantine, so the virus does not spread. The medical community has not discovered any vaccine that can be immediately used on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The only method discovered so far to protect people from this virus is keeping a distance from other people, wearing masks and gloves, as well as regularly washing and sanitizing hands. Government and law enforcement agencies are involved in banning the movement of people in different cities, to control the spread and monitor people following the guidelines of the CDC. But it is not possible for the government to monitor all places, such as shopping malls, hospitals, government offices, and banks, and guide people to follow the safety guidelines. In this paper, a novel technique is developed that can guide people to protect themselves from someone who has high exposure to the virus or has symptoms of COVID-19, such as having fever and coughing. Different deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models are implemented to test the proposed technique. The proposed intelligent monitoring system can be used as a complementary tool to be installed at different places and automatically monitor people adopting the safety guidelines. With these precautionary measurements, humans will be able to win this fight against COVID-19. © 2020 M.

In this study, eighty-eight reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17–83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity. © 2020, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS.","Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA); COVID-19; Nucleic acid test (NAT); Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT); Serologic test",,"32705575","Virol.

The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritised development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomised controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities.

Traditional Chinese medicine has recommended the use of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza species) in the treatment of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to identify the active molecule from the liquorice against different protein targets of COVID-19 using an in-silico approach. The molecular docking simulation study of 20 compounds along with two standard antiviral drugs (Lopinavir and Rivabirin) was carried out with the help of Autodock vina software using two protein targets from COVID-19 i.e. spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VSB) and Non-structural Protein-15 (Nsp15) endoribonuclease (PDB ID: 6W01). From the observed binding energy and the binding interactions, glyasperin A showed high affinity towards Nsp15 endoribonuclease with uridine specificity, while glycyrrhizic acid was found to be best suited for the binding pocket of spike glycoprotein and also prohibited the entry of the virus into the host cell. Further, the dynamic behavior of the best-docked molecules inside the spike glycoprotein and Nsp15 endoribonuclease were explored through all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Several parameters from the MD simulation have substantiated the stability of protein-ligand stability. The binding free energy of both glyasperin A and glycyrrhizic acid was calculated from the entire MD simulation trajectory through the MM-PBSA approach and found to high binding affinity towards the respective protein receptor cavity. Thus, glyasperin A and glycyrrhizic acid could be considered as the best molecule from liquorice, which could find useful against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are very similar viruses genomically and structurally, the huge number of severe cases and deaths now being caused by 2019-nCoV infections has understandably prompted intense research on the receptor used by it to enter human cells. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV, now appears likely to mediate 2019-nCoV entry into human cells. In this review, we describe the roles performed by ACE2 as an enzymatic catalyst and as a receptor for this novel coronavirus. We also summarize the latest research pertaining to the changes noted in ACE2 expression after viral binding, and the relationships relating to virus transmission and population susceptibility to it. Lastly, we speculate on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and provide a useful reference for drug development against this aggressive virus. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2019-nCoV; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus; Immune function; Renin angiotensin system; Virus receptor",,,"Cell.

The current gold standard is the conventional virus neutralization test requiring live pathogen and a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Here, we report a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test that detects total immunodominant neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain in an isotype- and species-independent manner. Our simple and rapid test is based on antibody-mediated blockage of the interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein and the receptor-binding domain. The test, which has been validated with two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 in two different countries, achieves 99.93% specificity and 95–100% sensitivity, and differentiates antibody responses to several human coronaviruses. The surrogate virus neutralization test does not require biosafety level 3 containment, making it broadly accessible to the wider community for both research and clinical applications. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"Antibodies; Biohazards; Clinical research; Testing; Vaccines; Viruses; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Antibody response; Clinical application; Neutralizing antibodies; Protein interaction; Receptor-binding domains; Vaccine efficacies; Virus neutralization; Diseases",,"Nat.

EY6A Fab binds the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein tightly (KD of 2 nM), and a 2.6-Å-resolution crystal structure of an RBD–EY6A Fab complex identifies the highly conserved epitope, away from the ACE2 receptor binding site. Residues within this footprint are key to stabilizing the pre-fusion spike. Cryo-EM analyses of the pre-fusion spike incubated with EY6A Fab reveal a complex of the intact spike trimer with three Fabs bound and two further multimeric forms comprising the destabilized spike attached to Fab.

Transmission of virus takes place either directly through close contact with infected individual (symptomatic/asymptomatic) or indirectly by touching contaminated surfaces. Virus survives on the surfaces from few hours to days. It enters the human body through nose, eyes or mouth. Other sources of contamination are faeces, blood, food, water, semen etc. Parameters such as temperature/relative humidity also play an important role in transmission. As the disease is evolving, so are the number of cases. Proper planning and restriction are helping in influencing the trajectory of the transmission. Various measures are undertaken to prevent infection such as maintaining hygiene, using facemasks, isolation/quarantine, social/physical distancing, in extreme cases lockdown (restricted movement except essential services) in hot spot areas or throughout the country. Countries that introduced various mitigation measures had experienced control in transmission of COVID-19. Python programming is conducted for change point analysis (CPA) using Bayesian probability approach for understanding the impact of restrictions and mitigation methods in terms of either increase or stagnation in number of COVID-19 cases for eight countries. From analysis it is concluded that countries which acted late in bringing in the social distancing measures are suffering in terms of high number of cases with USA, leading among eight countries analysed. The CPA week in comparison with date of lockdown and first reported case strongly correlates (Pearson’s r = − 0.86 to − 0.97) to cases, cases per unit area and cases per unit population, indicating earlier the mitigation strategy, lesser the number of cases. The overall paper will help the decision makers in understanding the possible steps for mitigation, more so in developing countries where the fight against COVID-19 seems to have just begun. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Bayesian probability; Change point analysis; COVID-19; COVID-19 health impacts; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Social distancing",,,"Environ.

Its pandemic form in human population and its probable animal origin, along with recent case reports in pets, make drivers of emergence crucial in domestic carnivore pets, especially cats, dogs and ferrets. Few data are available in these species; we first listed forty-six possible drivers of emergence of COVID-19 in pets, regrouped in eight domains (i.e. pathogen/disease characteristics, spatial-temporal distance of outbreaks, ability to monitor, disease treatment and control, characteristics of pets, changes in climate conditions, wildlife interface, human activity, and economic and trade activities). Secondly, we developed a scoring system per driver, then elicited scientific experts (N = 33) to: (a) allocate a score to each driver, (b) weight the drivers scores within each domain and (c) weight the different domains between them. Thirdly, an overall weighted score per driver was calculated; drivers were ranked in decreasing order. Fourthly, a regression tree analysis was used to group drivers with comparable likelihood to play a role in the emergence of COVID-19 in pets. Finally, the robustness of the expert elicitation was verified. Five drivers were ranked with the highest probability to play a key role in the emergence of COVID-19 in pets: availability and quality of diagnostic tools, human density close to pets, ability of preventive/control measures to avoid the disease introduction or spread in a country (except treatment, vaccination and reservoir(s) control), current species specificity of the disease-causing agent and current knowledge on the pathogen. As scientific knowledge on the topic is scarce and still uncertain, expert elicitation of knowledge, in addition with clustering and sensitivity analyses, is of prime importance to prioritize future studies, starting from the top five drivers.

At present, diagnosis COVID-19 were based on real-time RT-PCR, which have to be performed in biosafe laboratory and is unsatisfactory for suspect case screening. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body detection in suspected COVID-19 cases. Methods: In the prospective cohort, 150 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang province, China, between January 20 to February 2, 2020. All patients were tested by the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for COVID-19. At least two samples of each patient were collected for RT-PCR assay analysis, and the PCR results were performed as the reference standard of diagnosis. Meanwhile 26 heathy blood donor were recruited. The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated. Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity. Results: The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993]. In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result. In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970]. Conclusions: The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19. Further investigations should be done to evaluate this assay in variety of clinical settings and populations. © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted. © The author(s).","Animal reservoir; Bats; Coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2","animal; bat; Betacoronavirus; China; classification; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease carrier; host pathogen interaction; human; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; rodent; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; China; Chiroptera; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Evolution, Molecular; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rodentia; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Zoonoses","32226286","Int.

The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, geros ""old man"" and epilavis, ""harmful"") infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older. This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging. Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases. While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations. Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients. This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections. This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age. These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included ‘sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)’ as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. Results: Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine. © 2020 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society.","anosmia; chemosensory dysfunction; COVID-19; dysgeusia; loss of smell; Loss of taste; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Acta Odontol.

Hence a rapid drug repositioning and lead identification strategy are required to mitigate these outbreaks. We report a pharmacophore and molecular dynamics-based approach for drug repositioning and lead identification against dual targets (3CLp and PLp) of SARS-CoV-2. The pharmacophore model of 3CLp inhibitors was apolar with two aromatic and two H-bond acceptors, whereas that of PLp was relatively polar, bearing one aromatic and three H-bond acceptors. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening yielded six existing FDA-approved drugs and twelve natural products with both the pharmacophoric features. Among them are nelfinavir, tipranavir and licochalcone-D, which has shown better binding characteristics with both the proteases compared to lopinavir. The molecular dynamics revealed that the connecting loop (residues 176–199) of 3CLp is highly flexible, and hence, inhibitors should avoid high-affinity interactions with it. Lopinavir, due to its high affinity with the loop region, exhibited unstable binding. Further, the van der Waals size of the 3CLp inhibitors positively correlated with their binding affinity with 3CLp. However, the van der Waals size of a ligand should not cross a threshold of 572Å3, beyond which the ligands are likely to make high-affinity interaction with the loop and suffer unstable binding as observed in the case of lopinavir. Similarly, the total polar surface area of the ligands were found to be negatively correlated with their binding affinity with PLp. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3CL-protease; anti-HIV drugs; molecular dynamics; natural products; Pharmacophore; PL-protease; protease inhibitors; SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors","antiretrovirus agent; chymotrypsin; licochalcone D; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nelfinavir; novobiocin; ofloxacin; papain; protein 3 chymotrypsin; proteinase inhibitor; tipranavir; trimethoprim; unclassified drug; viral protein; Article; binding affinity; coronavirus disease 2019; drug approval; drug protein binding; drug repositioning; drug screening; drug structure; hydrogen bond; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; pharmacophore; phytochemistry; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface area","32698693","J.

We conducted a prospective study aimed at assessing the ability of LUS to predict mortality and intensive care unit admission of COVID-19 patients evaluated in a tertiary level emergency department.

The consequent inflammation is not able to clear viruses. The persistent excessive inflammatory response can build up a clinical picture that is very difficult to manage and potentially fatal. Modulating the immune response plays a key role in fighting the disease. One of the main defence systems is the activation of neutrophils that release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) under the stimulus of autophagy. Various molecules can induce NETosis and autophagy; some potent activators are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and, in particular, the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). This molecule is released by damaged lung cells and can induce a robust innate immunity response. The increase in HMGB1 and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, blocking these molecules might be useful in COVID-19 treatment and should be further studied in the context of targeted therapy. © 2020 Sebastiano Cicco et al.",,"anakinra; biological factor; chloroquine; cytokine receptor antagonist; damage associated molecular pattern; eculizumab; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; remdesivir; steroid; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; alarmin; high mobility group B1 protein; HMGB1 protein, human; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; extracellular trap; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; immunity; inflammation; lung disease; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; plasma; respiratory virus; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; steroid therapy; systematic review (topic); viral respiratory tract infection; virus; virus infection; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; extracellular trap; immunology; lung; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Alarmins; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Extracellular Traps; HMGB1 Protein; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32724296","Mediators Inflamm.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088851846

So far, no specific antiviral therapeutic agent has been demonstrated to be effective for COVID-19; therefore, the clinical management is largely supportive and depends on the patients' immune response leading to a cytokine storm followed by lung edema, dysfunction of air exchange, and ARDS, which could lead to multiorgan failure and death. Given that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various tissue sources have revealed successful clinical outcomes in many immunocompromised disorders by inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the microenvironment, there is a growing demand for MSC infusions in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS in the ICU. In this review, we have documented the rationale and possible outcomes of compassionate use of MSCs, particularly in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, toward proving or disproving the efficacy of this approach in the near future. Many centers have registered and approved, and some already started, single-case or phase I/II trials primarily aiming to rescue their critical patients when no other therapeutic approach responds. On the other hand, it is also very important to mention that there is a good deal of concern about clinics offering unproven stem cell treatments for COVID-19. The reviewers and oversight bodies will be looking for a balanced but critical appraisal of current trials. © 2020 The Authors.

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results: Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions: HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; QT prolongation; SARS-CoV-2; Torsades de Pointes",,,"Res.

This disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions.

The objective of this study is to identify, among Madrid's adult population, the impact of COVID-19 on self-perceived vulnerability, infectiousness, aversion to germs, and other behaviors in the current situation regarding dental practice. This cross-sectional observational study involves 1,008 persons randomly surveyed on the streets of Madrid, Spain between March 1 and March 8, 2020. Their perceived vulnerability to disease was measured using the perceived vulnerability to disease scale. An additional questionnaire evaluated basic sociodemographic aspects, medical history, personal hygiene behavior, willingness to go to certain places and the perception of the risk of contagion when going to a dental practice. There are significant differences by sex on the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05) and in the risk of waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), tooth extraction (p < 0.05), endodontics (p < 0.05) and fillings (p < 0.05). Women consider the risk to be higher than men do. The risk group (over 60 and with systemic disease) has significant differences on the subscales of infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01). Our study shows high levels of vulnerability regarding contracting COVID-19 and avoiding dental care as perceived by the population over 60 years old and with a systemic disease. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia.","Coronavirus infections; COVID-19; Disease transmission; Infectious","adolescent; adult; adverse event; aged; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; dental procedure; female; human; male; middle aged; nonparametric test; pandemic; risk assessment; risk factor; self report; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex ratio; socioeconomics; Spain; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Care; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Self Report; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Spain; Statistics, Nonparametric; Young Adult","32401934","Braz.

At present, the role of lung ultrasonography (LUS) has yet to be explored. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between LUS findings and chest CT in patients confirmed to have (positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) or clinically highly suspected of having (dyspnea, fever, myasthenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry cough, ageusia or anosmia) COVID-19. This prospective study was carried out in the emergency department, where patients confirmed of having or clinically highly suspected of having COVID-19 were recruited and underwent chest CT and concurrent LUS exam. An experienced emergency department physician performed the LUS exam blind to the clinical history and results of the CT scan, which were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus for signs compatible with COVID-19 (bilateral ground-glass opacities in peripheral distribution). A compatible LUS exam was considered a bilateral pattern of B-lines, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations. Between March and April 2020, 51 patients were consecutively enrolled. The indication for CT was a negative or indeterminate RT-PCR test (49.0%) followed by suspicion of pulmonary embolism (41.2%). Radiologic signs compatible with COVID-19 were present in 37 patients (72.5%) on CT scan and 40 patients (78.4%) on LUS exam. The presence of LUS findings was correlated with a positive CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 (odds ratio: 13.3, 95% confidence interval: 4.5–39.6, p < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 100.0%, specificity of 78.6%, positive predictive value of 92.5% and negative predictive value of 100.0%. There was no missed diagnosis of COVID-19 with LUS compared with CT in our cohort. The correlation between LUS score and CT total severity score was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.803, 95% confidence interval: 0.60–0.90, p < 0.001).

A fast and label free detection method for the novel coronavirus needs to be developed along with the existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based methods. Areas covered: In this report, biophysical aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein are outlined based on its recent reported electron microscopy structure. Protein binding sites are analyzed theoretically, which consisted of hydrophobic and positive charged amino acid residues. Different strategies to form mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of hydrophobic (CH3) and negatively charged (COOH) groups are discussed to be used for the specific and strong interactions with spike protein. Bio-interfacial interactions between the spike protein and device (sensor) surface and its implications towards designing suitable engineered surfaces are summarized. Expert opinion: Implementation of the engineered surfaces in quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) based detection techniques for the diagnosis of the novel coronavirus from oral swab samples is highlighted. The proposed strategy can be explored for the label free and real time detection with sensitivity up to ng level. These engineered surfaces can be reused after desorption. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Binding sites; Bio-interface; Quartz crystal microbalance; SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein; Self-assembled monolayers; Surface modification","amino acid; glycoprotein; self assembled monolayer; Article; binding site; electron microscopy; nonhuman; prospective study; protein binding; quartz crystal microbalance; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface property; virus detection","32654533","Expert Rev.

Herein, we review the imaging characteristics and computing models that have been applied for the management of COVID-19. CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up. The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored. Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19. In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.

The plasma sample preparation procedure includes a combination of protein precipitation using cold acetonitrile and liquid–liquid extraction with n-hexane–ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v). A good chromatographic separation was achieved with a Phenomenex Gemini column (C18, 150 mm × 2.0 mm, 5 μm) at 40°C with gradient elution, at 211 nm. Calibration curves were linear in the range 10–10,000 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantification of 10 ng/mL using 100 μL of plasma. The accuracy and precision in all validation experiments were within the criteria range set by the guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration. This method was successfully applied to a preliminary pharmacokinetic study in rats following an intravenous bolus administration of LPV. Moreover, the method was subsequently fully validated for human plasma, allowing its use in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). In conclusion, this novel, simple and cost-efficient bioanalytical method for determination of LPV is useful for pharmacokinetic and drug delivery studies in rats, as well as TDM in human patients. © 2020 The Authors.

Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine. © 2020 Triggle et al.","COVID-19; Drugs; Vaccines","arbidol; azithromycin; baricitinib; BCG vaccine; beta interferon; celecoxib; chloroquine; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; paracetamol; remdesivir; ritonavir; tocilizumab; umifenovir; zanamivir; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug bioavailability; drug development; evidence based medicine; human; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Short Survey; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines","32404514","mSphere",Short Survey,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084626247

Complement regulator gene variants prevalent in African-Americans have been associated with a higher risk for severe TMA and multi-organ injury.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), highly regarded for their regenerative capacities, also possessesremarkable immunoregulatory functions affecting all types of innate and adaptive immune cells. Owing to that, MSCs have been heavily investigated in clinic for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases along with transplant rejection. Extensive research in the last decaderevealed that MSCs carry out most of their functions through paracrine factors which are soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, including exosomes and microvesicles, are an efficient way of intercellular communication due to their unique ability to carry biological messages such as transcription factors, growth factors, cytokines, mRNAs and miRNAs over long distances. EVs originate through direct budding of the cell membrane or the endosomal secretion pathway and they consist of the cytosolic and membrane components of their parent cell. Therefore, they are able to mimic the characteristics of the parent cell, affecting the target cells upon binding or internalization. EVs secreted by MSCs are emerging as a cell-free alternative to MSC-based therapies. MSC EVs are being tested in preclinical and clinical settings where they exhibit exceptional immunosuppressivecapacity. They regulate the migration, proliferation, activation and polarization of various immune cells, promoting a tolerogenic immune response while inhibiting inflammatory response. Being as effective immunomodulators as their parent cells, MSC EVs are also preferable over MSC-based therapies due to their lower risk of immunogenicity, tumorigenicity and overall superior safety. In this review, we present the outcomes of preclinical and clinical studies utilizing MSC EVs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide variety of immunological disorders. © TUBİTAK.","Autoimmunity; COVID-1; Exosomes; Extracellular vesicles; Inflammation; Mesenchymal stem cells",,,"Turk.

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%.

These include viral variability and hence the requirement to match strains by estimating which will become prevalent each season, problems associated with vaccine and adjuvant production, and the route of administration as well as the perceived lower vaccine efficiency in older adults. Clinical protection is still suboptimal for all of these reasons, and vaccine uptake remains too low in most countries. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines include developing universal vaccines independent of the circulating strains in any particular season and stimulating cellular as well as humoral responses, especially in the elderly.

Since the beginning of 2020, an unprecedented international academic and industrial effort to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has diverted attention away from influenza, but many of the lessons learned for the one will synergize with the other to mutual advantage. And, unlike the SARS-1 epidemic and, we hope, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, influenza will not be eliminated and thus efforts to improve influenza vaccines will remain of crucial importance. © 2020 Pawelec G and McElhaney J.","Adjuvant; Effectiveness; Elderly; Influenza; Vaccine","adjuvant; influenza vaccine; toll like receptor; influenza vaccine; cost effectiveness analysis; drug administration route; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug formulation; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; nonhuman; personalized medicine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccine production; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; influenza; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32399192","F1000 Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084627053

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care for several solid cancers and are associated with peculiar toxicities, including pneumonitis which has similar features to COVID-19 pneumonia. Areas covered: We summarize the main hallmarks of lung injury induced by ICIs and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and discuss the critical aspects for differential diagnosis and management. Symptoms and radiological findings are often similar; conversely, treatments are quite different. Furthermore, we focus on potential interactions generating hypotheses that need confirmatory studies. Expert opinion: All cancer patients treated with immunotherapy should receive screening for SARS-CoV-2. This would improve the diagnosis and management of pneumonia and guide therapeutic choices. Furthermore, clinicians could estimate the risk/benefit of continuing ICI treatment in COVID-19 positive patients. Temporary withdrawal of the immunotherapy treatment pending resolution of viral infection may be a reasonable option in long-responders patients. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coronavirus; COVID-19; immune checkpoint inhibitors; immune-related Pneumonitis; immunotherapy; pneumonia","immunological antineoplastic agent; cancer immunotherapy; coronavirus disease 2019; differential diagnosis; Editorial; human; immune related pneumonitis; immunopathology; lung injury; nonhuman; pneumonia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction","32588674","Expert Opin.

This began as an outbreak in December 2019, and till February 28, 2020, there have been 83,704 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, with 2,859 deaths, resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 3.41 per cent (95% confidence interval 3.29-3.54%). By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) were affected. As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of kneejerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.","COVID-19-epidemic; MERS-CoV; novel coronavirus; pandemic; quarantine; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; transmission","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cobicistat; D dimer; darunavir; hydroxychloroquine; lactate dehydrogenase; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; umifenovir; virus vaccine; case fatality rate; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; disease control; disease surveillance; disease transmission; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extracorporeal oxygenation; fatigue; fecal microbiota transplantation; fever; hand washing; human; hypertension; incubation time; India; indirect fluorescent antibody technique; lymphocytopenia; myalgia; pandemic; prophylaxis; prothrombin time; public health; quarantine; Review; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum analysis; travel; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; organization and management; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","32362642","Indian J.

Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples are generally collected for serial viral load screening of respiratory contagions, but temporal profiles of these samples are not completely clear in patients with COVID-19. We performed an observational cohort study at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, which involved 31 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without underlying diseases. We obtained samples from each patient, and serial viral load was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that the viral load in the sputum was inclined to be higher than samples obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab at disease presentation. Moreover, the viral load in the sputum decreased more slowly over time than in the nasopharyngeal group as the disease progressed. Interestingly, even when samples in the nasopharyngeal swab turned negative, it was commonly observed that patients with underlying diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, remained positive for COVID-19 and required a longer period for the sputum samples to turn negative. These combined findings emphasize the importance of tracking sputum samples even in patients with negative tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, especially for those with underlying conditions. In conclusion, this work reinforces the importance of sputum samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection to minimize transmission of COVID-19 within the community. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2020.","bodily secretions; coronavirus; public health; serial passage; virulence; virus infections",,,"J.

The viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus or COVID-19 (CoV-19) is known as a pandemic. After SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)–related CoV, COVID-19 is the third most pathogenic virus, hazardous to humans which have raised worries concerning the capacity of current security measures and the human services framework to deal with such danger. Recent Findings: According to WHO, the mortality rate of COVID-19 exceeded that of SARS and MERS in view of which COVID-19 was declared as public health emergency of international concern. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with single stranded RNA and non-segmented envelopes. Recently, genome sequencing confirmed that COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus, but the major source of this pandemic outbreak, its transmission, and mechanisms related to its pathogenicity to humans are not yet known. Summary: In order to prevent the further pandemic and loss to humanity, scientists are studying the development of therapeutic drugs, vaccines, and strategies to cure the infections. In this review, we present a brief introduction to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, i.e., coronavirus in humans and animals, its taxonomic classification, genome organization, its replication, pathogenicity, impact on socioeconomic growth, and drugs associated with COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Coronavirus; MERS-CoV; RNA genomes; SARS-CoV",,,"Curr.

With the rapid spread of this virus, an immense burden has fallen upon both healthcare and economic systems. As a consequence, there is an unprecedented urgency for researchers and scientific committees from all over the world to find an effective treatment and vaccine. Review Structure: Many potential therapies are currently under investigation, with some, like Hydroxychloroquine, being authorized for emergency use in some countries. The crucial issue is now clearly to find the suitable treatment strategy for patients given comorbidities and the timeline of the illness. Vaccines are also under development and phase 1 clinical trials are rolling. Despite all efforts, no single drug or vaccine has yet been approved. In this review, we aim at presenting the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide clinicians with a brief and solid overview of the current potential treatments classified according to their use at the three different currently proposed disease stages. In light of pathogenesis and proposed clinical classification, this review's purpose is to summarize and simplify the most important updates on the management and the potential treatment of this emergent disease. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Pathophysiology; Treatment",,,"Curr.

Coronaviruses are positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses that infect several animal species, causing symptoms that range from those similar to the common cold to severe respiratory syndrome. The Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV2 functional receptor. Measures are currently undertaken worldwide to control the infection to avoid disruption of the social and economic equilibrium, especially in countries with poor healthcare resources. In a guarded optimistic view, we hope that the undertaken preventive and treatment measures will at least contribute to contain viral diffusion, attenuate activity, or even eliminate SARS-CoV2. In this review, we discuss emerging perspectives for prevention/treatment of COVID-19 infection. In addition to vaccines under development, passive immunization is an open opportunity since patients develop neutralizing antibodies. A full spectrum of potential drugs for COVID-19 infections could in turn affect virus binding or enzymatic activities involved in viral replication and transcription. Furthermore, clinical trials are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as tocilizumab. Bioinformatics may allow characterization of specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses; thus, CoV2 T cells’ frequency can be correlated with the disease severity and outcome. Combinatorial antibody phage display may be empowered to identify the immune repertoire of CoV2-specific neutralizing antibodies. © 2020 by the authors.

SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. We describe here the positivity for COVID-19 among SARI patients and their characteristics. Methods: SARI patients admitted at 41 sentinel sites from February 15, 2020 onwards were tested for COVID-19 by real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, targeting E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network for analysis. Results: A total of 104 (1.8%) of the 5,911 SARI patients tested were positive for COVID-19. These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 States/Union Territories. The COVID-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years. In all, 40 (39.2%) COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel. Interpretation & conclusions: COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting COVID-19 cases among SARI patients. Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.","Containment; COVID-19; SARI; sentinel; surveillance","RNA directed RNA polymerase; adult; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; E gene; female; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nose smear; quarantine; RdRp gene; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus gene; adolescent; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; India; infant; middle aged; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; sentinel surveillance; severe acute respiratory syndrome; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sentinel Surveillance; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Young Adult","32362647","Indian J.

Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, the recombination of an alpha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely.

The ecological behavior and unique immune characteristics of bats are optimal for the homologous recombination of CoVs.

COVID-19 is a disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that produces in patients fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, and even sore throat. The virus spreads through the air, and to date, is expanding as a global pandemic. There is no vaccine, and it is fatal to approximately 2-7% of the infected population. Among the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of infected patients, nodules have been identified in images of chest x-rays that can be visually identified, producing a simple, rapid, and generally available method of identification. However, the rapid spread of the disease means that there is a lack of specialized medical personnel capable of identifying it, which is why automated schemes are being developed. We propose the tuning of a NASNet-type convolutional model to automatically determine the initial state of a patient in the triage process or intervention protocol of health care centers. The neural network is trained with public images of cases positively identified as patients infected with the virus and patients in normal conditions without infection. Performance evaluation is also done with real images unknown to the neuronal model. As for performance metrics, we use the function of loss of cross-entropy (categorical cross-entropy), the accuracy (or success rate), and the MSE (Mean Squared Error). The tuned model was able to correctly classify the test images with an accuracy of 97%. © 2020, Insight Society.","Convolutional neural network; COVID-19; Data mining; Diagnostic radiography; Diseases; Feature extraction; Image classification; Medical image processing; Radiographs data mining; ROC chart",,,"Int.

IgM titer ≥ 50 AU/ml was also correlated with higher incidences of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis shock. Antibody remeasurements were performed in 42 patients, where IgM titer declined significantly in survivors (p=0.031). Serum IgM titer changes according to the COVID-19 progression. The severe/critical patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of clinical adverse events when IgM titer ≥ 50 AU/ml. Further decreasing of IgM could imply a better outcome in severe/critical cases. © Liu et al.","Antibody; COVID-19; In-hospital mortality; Intensive care; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; China; cohort analysis; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; female; hospital mortality; human; immunology; male; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies","32628642","Aging",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088495002

Many factors are involved, and though impressive strides have been made in studying this novel disease in a very short time, there is still a great deal that is unknown about how the virus functions. Clinical data has been crucial for providing information on COVID-19 progression and determining risk factors. However, the mechanisms leading to the multi-tissue pathology are yet to be fully established. Although insights from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been valuable, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is different and merits its own extensive studies. In this review, we highlight unresolved questions surrounding this virus including the temporal immune dynamics, infection of non-pulmonary tissue, early life exposure, and the role of circadian rhythms. Risk factors such as sex and exposure to pollutants are also explored followed by a discussion of ways in which bioengineering approaches can be employed to help understand COVID-19. The use of sophisticated in vitro models can be employed to interrogate intercellular interactions and also to tease apart effects of the virus itself from the resulting immune response. Additionally, spatiotemporal information can be gleaned from these models to learn more about the dynamics of the virus and COVID-19 progression. Application of advanced tissue and organ system models into COVID-19 research can result in more nuanced insight into the mechanisms underlying this condition and elucidate strategies to combat its effects. © 2020, Biomedical Engineering Society.","ACE2; ARDS; Circadian rhythms; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Host response; Immune; Organotypic models; Placenta; Sex differences",,,"Cell.

By February 2020, cases had been identified in multiple countries, clinical trials of treatments with some biological plausibility had begun in China, and the initial steps of vaccine development were underway. In mid-March, by which time countries around the world were experiencing rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the World Health Organization categorized the outbreak as a pandemic. This new coronavirus was designated SARS-COV-2 in recognition of its similarity to the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002–2003. The race is on to develop treatments that can mitigate the severe consequences of infection and vaccines that can prevent infection and/or diminish the severity of disease in those who do get infected. Many challenges face these development efforts. Some are similar to those faced in the past; others are new.

Since they were unable to detect the precise cause, they named it ”Pneumonia of unknown etiology”. Later it was identified as SARS COV 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – coronavirus 2). At first, the disease spread locally affecting the people of Wuhan, and then started spreading throughout China, creating a worldwide panic. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from China and local healthcare units organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The causative organism of this infection is a new virus that belongs to the “coronavirus (CoV)” family. After which the disease was called nCoV-19 (Novel coronavirus – 19). On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, renamed the disease as ”COVID-19,” which is the acronym of ”coronavirus disease 2019”. Viral epidemics like SARS-CoV in 2002, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and the most recent one the MERS-CoV Middle East Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus (first identified in Saudi Arabia) in 2012 threatened the health of mankind in the past two decades. All of these were successfully prevented by systematically approaching the problem to solve it. Healthcare professionals around the world are well trained to manage any type of health crisis. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a ”PANDEMIC” pointing to over 118,000 cases and 80,000 dead in 110 countries or more.

SARS, MERS, Ebola, Nipah and an array of arenavirus infections sporadically spillover into human populations and are often contained only as a result of their poor transmission in human hosts, coupled with intense public health control efforts in the early stages of an emerging epidemic. It is now more apparent than ever that we need a better and more proactive approach. One possibility is to eliminate the threat of spillover before it occurs using vaccines capable of autonomously spreading through wild animal reservoirs. We are now poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines targeting a wide range of human pathogens, but important decisions remain about how they can be most effectively designed and used to target pathogens with a high risk of spillover and/or emergence. In this Perspective, we first review the basic epidemiological theory establishing the feasibility and utility of self-disseminating vaccines. We then outline a road map for overcoming remaining technical challenges: identifying high-risk pathogens before they emerge, optimizing vaccine design with an eye to evolution, behaviour and epidemiology, and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,,,"Nat.

The causative agent of this infection is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The data available on one of the promising therapeutic agents—nucleotide analog remdesivir (Gilead Sciences number GS5734)—were evaluated. These data were concerned with remdesivir activation from the prodrug to the active molecule—triphosphate containing 1′-cyano group and modified nucleobase. This triphosphate competes with the natural substrate adenosine triphosphate. Additionally, its mechanisms of action based on RNA and proofreading exonuclease inhibition, leading to the delayed RNA chain termination of infected cells, and basic pharmacological data were assessed. Additionally, the analytical determination of remdesivir and its metabolites in cells and body liquids and also some data from remdesivir use in other RNA infections—such as Ebola, Nipah virus infection, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—were summarized. More recent and more detailed data on the clinical use of remdesivir in COVID-19 were reported, showing the intensive efforts of clinicians and scientists to develop a cure for this new disease. Remdesivir as such represents one of the more promising alternatives for COVID-19 therapy, however the current understanding of this disease and the possible ways of dealing with it requires further investigation. © 2020 by the authors.

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) enables early detection of pandemic viruses and plays a vital role in preventing onward transmission. However, the requirement of skilled operators, expensive instrumentation, and biosafety laboratories has hindered the use of NAAT for screening and diagnosis of suspected patients. Here we report development of a fully automated centrifugal microfluidic system with sample-in-answer-out capability for sensitive, specific, and rapid viral nucleic acid testing. The release of nucleic acids and the subsequent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) were integrated into the reaction units of a microfluidic disc. The whole processing steps such as injection of reagents, fluid actuation by rotation, heating and temperature control, and detection of fluorescence signals were carried out automatically by a customized instrument. We validate the centrifugal microfluidic system using oropharyngeal swab samples spiked with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) armored RNA particles. The estimated limit of detection for armored RNA particles is 2 copies per reaction, the throughput is 21 reactions per disc, and the assay sample-to-answer time is approximately 70 min.

In this study, a total of 512 bat faecal samples from the bat habitats at different geographical locations in South Korea were investigated between 2016 and 2019. Seventy-eight samples were positive for coronaviruses (15.2%), comprising 68 alphacoronaviruses (13.3%) and 10 betacoronaviruses (2.0%). The positive rates tended to increase during the awakening (April) period. Notably, betacoronaviruses were only found in the site where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was the major species of bats, and were related to SARS- and MERS-related CoVs identified in China and South Korea, respectively. No betacoronaviruses were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in this study. Alphacoronaviruses were detected in the sites where Hypsugo alaschanicus, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis bombinus, Myotis macrodactylus and Myotis petax were found to be the major bat species. Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses and had a wider distribution in Korea. Considering that different bat species are co-roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross-species transmission events due to the richness in host species. Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co-roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","alphacoronavirus; bats; coronavirus; diversity; host sharing; Korea",,"32473082","Transboundary Emer.

During this epidemic, health authorities requested swab tests, while seeking new patient paths. Methods: A dual laboratory approach was evaluated, consisting of patient care reports for viral RNA detection on swabs and rapid serological tests in 516 patients (192 symptomatic or paucisymptomatic and 324 asymptomatic). Results: We found the molecular positive fraction equal to 12% (23/192) among symptomatic/paucisymptomatic (S/P) and 15.4% (50/324) in asymptomatic (As) sets. Among subsets, we observed serologically positive results, corresponding to 35% (8/23) for S/P and 38% (19/50) for As. Among molecular negative cases, we detected specific Immunoglobulin G or M (Ig G or Ig M) positivity in the S/P cohort equal to 6.6% (11/167) and 6% (15/246) in As cases. For indeterminate molecular results, we found S/P serological positivity equal to 100% (1/1) and 54% (13/24) in As patients. We found higher (p < 0.05) seropositivity in older patients (n = 8) among symptomatic and positives for viral RNA (n.23). Conclusions: It has been observed that a dual approach of serological and molecular tests detects a higher absolute number of disease cases in a pandemic context,which could improve monitoring and health surveillance efficacy. The age-related seropositivity frequency in this study, if confirmed, could enhance the validity of serological tests, especially in older patients.In these subjects, molecular positivity accompanied by serological positivity (distinct for M and G immunoglobulins) should help determine disease status and support decisions related to patient management. © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists","Asymptomatic patients; COronaVIrus disease 19; Serological tests; Swabs; Symptomatic/paucisymptomaticpatients",,"32702365","Clin.

First, in Wuhan, China, the novel SARS-CoV2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO), as 2019-nCOV (COVID-19), and spread extremely all over the world. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted to individuals by human-to-human transmission leading to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory system injury. SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction. There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered. Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; diagnosis; molecular assays; radiological findings; serological assays",,"32452050","J.

A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach. Method. Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results. Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion. The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks. © 2020 Miyssa I.

Therefore, the development of COVID-19 testing kits is still an open area of research. Recently, many studies have shown that chest Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for COVID-19 testing, as chest CT images show a bilateral change in COVID-19 infected patients. However, the classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images is not an easy task as predicting the bilateral change is defined as an ill-posed problem. Therefore, in this paper, a deep transfer learning technique is used to classify COVID-19 infected patients. Additionally, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive attributes is also utilized to handle noisy and imbalanced COVID-19 dataset kind of problems. Experimental results reveal that the proposed deep transfer learning-based COVID-19 classification model provides efficient results as compared to the other supervised learning models. © 2020","Chest CT images; Classification; COVID-19; Deep learning; Disease",,,"IRBM",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085319628

Recent statistics indicate that the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 is increasing exponentially, with more than 1.6 million confirmed cases; the disease is spreading to many countries across the world. In this study, we analyse the incidence of COVID-19 distribution across the world. We present an artificial-intelligence technique based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect COVID-19 patients using real-world datasets. Our system examines chest X-ray images to identify such patients. Our findings indicate that such an analysis is valuable in COVID-19 diagnosis as X-rays are conveniently available quickly and at low costs. Empirical findings obtained from 1000 X-ray images of real patients confirmed that our proposed system is useful in detecting COVID-19 and achieves an F-measure range of 95-99%. Additionally, three forecasting methods-the prophet algorithm (PA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM)-were adopted to predict the numbers of COVID-19 confirmations, recoveries, and deaths over the next 7 days. The prediction results exhibit promising performance and offer an average accuracy of 94.80% and 88.43% in Australia and Jordan, respectively. Our proposed system can significantly help identify the most infected cities, and it has revealed that coastal areas are heavily impacted by the COVID-19 spread as the number of cases is significantly higher in those areas than in non-coastal areas. © 2020 MIR Labs.","Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; COVID-19; Machine learning; X-ray",,,"Int.

In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease. We propose a transfer learning model to quicken the prediction process and assist the medical professionals. The proposed model outperforms the other existing models. This makes the time-consuming process easier and faster for radiologists and this reduces the spread of virus and save lives. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chest X-Ray; Computed tomography; COVID-19; Haralick feature; Transfer learning; Viral pneumonia","Acoustic impedance; Computerized tomography; Disease control; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Textures; Viruses; Area of interest; Haralick features; Learning techniques; Medical professionals; Prediction process; Spread of disease; Spread of virus; Texture feature extraction; Transfer learning",,"Appl Intell",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089356353

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; computer-aided diagnostic tool; COVID-19 pneumonia; machine learning; transfer learning; viral pneumonia","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Database systems; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Functional polymers; Polymerase chain reaction; Transfer learning; Automatic Detection; Classification accuracy; Computer aided diagnostics; Health care professionals; Learning techniques; Preventive measures; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Technological tools; Learning algorithms",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089309357

However, RT-PCR kits are costly and take 6-9 hours to confirm infection in the patient. Due to less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it provides high false-negative results. To resolve this problem, radiological imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect and diagnose COVID-19. In this paper, chest X-rays is preferred over CT scan. The reason behind this is that X-rays machines are available in most of the hospitals. X-rays machines are cheaper than the CT scan machine. Besides this, X-rays has low ionizing radiations than CT scan. COVID-19 reveals some radiological signatures that can be easily detected through chest X-rays. For this, radiologists are required to analyze these signatures. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Hence, there is a need to automate the analysis of chest X-rays. The automatic analysis of chest X-rays can be done through deep learning-based approaches, which may accelerate the analysis time. These approaches can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine-tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. However, these approaches applied to chest X-rays are very limited. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to develop an automated deep transfer learning-based approach for detection of COVID-19 infection in chest X-rays by using the extreme version of the Inception (Xception) model.

To tackle this problem, we herewith report the fabrication of the surface functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNP’s) and viral RNA-extraction protocol for potential detection of COVID-19. The zinc ferrite nanoparticles were prepared by combustion synthesis and its surface was functionalised by silica and carboxyl-modified polyvinyl alcohol. The MNP’s were characterized to confirm the nano-scale appearance and functionalization.

The coronavirus spread so quickly between people and approaches 100,000 people worldwide. In this consequence, it is very much essential to identify the infected people so that prevention of spread can be taken. In this paper, the deep feature plus support vector machine (SVM) based methodology is suggested for detection of coronavirus infected patient using X-ray images. For classification, SVM is used instead of deep learning based classifier, as the later one need a large dataset for training and validation. The deep features from the fully connected layer of CNN model are extracted and fed to SVM for classification purpose. The SVM classifies the corona affected X-ray images from others. The methodology consists of three categories of Xray images, i.e., COVID-19, pneumonia and normal. The method is beneficial for the medical practitioner to classify among the COVID-19 patient, pneumonia patient and healthy people. SVM is evaluated for detection of COVID-19 using the deep features of different 13 number of CNN models. The SVM produced the best results using the deep feature of ResNet50. The classification model, i.e. ResNet50 plus SVM achieved accuracy, sensitivity, FPR and F1 score of 95.33%,95.33%,2.33% and 95.34% respectively for detection of COVID-19 (ignoring SARS, MERS and ARDS). Again, the highest accuracy achieved by ResNet50 plus SVM is 98.66%. The result is based on the Xray images available in the repository of GitHub and Kaggle. As the data set is in hundreds, the classification based on SVM is more robust compared to the transfer learning approach. Also, a comparison analysis of other traditional classification method is carried out. The traditional methods are local binary patterns (LBP) plus SVM, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) plus SVM and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) plus SVM. In traditional image classification method, LBP plus SVM achieved 93.4% of accuracy. © 2020 International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Deep features; Diagnosis; SVM",,,"Int.

In December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus emerged in Wuhan (China), causing a global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the capacity of three event-based surveillance (EBS) systems (ProMED, HealthMap and PADI-web) to detect early COVID-19 emergence signals. We focused on changes in online news vocabulary over the period before/after the identification of COVID-19, while also assessing its contagiousness and pandemic potential. ProMED was the timeliest EBS, detecting signals one day before the official notification. At this early stage, the specific vocabulary used was related to ‘pneumonia symptoms’ and ‘mystery illness’. Once COVID-19 was identified, the vocabulary changed to virus family and specific COVID-19 acronyms. Our results suggest that the three EBS systems are complementary regarding data sources, and all require timeliness improvements.

These techniques can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. Due to the small COVID-19 dataset available, the pre-trained neural networks can be used for diagnosis of coronavirus. However, these techniques applied on chest CT image is very limited till now. Hence, the main aim of this paper to use the pre-trained deep learning architectures as an automated tool to detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 in chest CT. A DenseNet201 based deep transfer learning (DTL) is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not i.e. COVID-19 (+) or COVID (−). The proposed model is utilized to extract features by using its own learned weights on the ImageNet dataset along with a convolutional neural structure. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the propose DTL model on COVID-19 chest CT scan images. Comparative analyses reveal that the proposed DTL based COVID-19 classification model outperforms the competitive approaches. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Of those 30 countries, 27 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases is relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. Generally, the transmission rates in Europe were lower than in the Americas and Asia. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19.

Thousands of people have lost their lives to this disease. Its negative effects on public health are ongoing. In this study, an intelligence computer-aided model that can automatically detect positive COVID-19 cases is proposed to support daily clinical applications. The proposed model is based on the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and can automatically reveal discriminative features on chest X-ray images through its convolution with rich filter families, abstraction, and weight-sharing characteristics. Contrary to the generally used transfer learning approach, the proposed deep CNN model was trained from scratch. Instead of the pre-trained CNNs, a novel serial network consisting of five convolution layers was designed. This CNN model was utilized as a deep feature extractor. The extracted deep discriminative features were used to feed the machine learning algorithms, which were k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The experiments were conducted on a public COVID-19 radiology database. The database was divided into two parts as training and test sets with 70% and 30% rates, respectively. As a result, the most efficient results were ensured by the SVM classifier with an accuracy of 98.97%, a sensitivity of 89.39%, a specificity of 99.75%, and an F-score of 96.72%. Consequently, a cheap, fast, and reliable intelligence tool has been provided for COVID-19 infection detection. The developed model can be used to assist field specialists, physicians, and radiologists in the decision-making process. Thanks to the proposed tool, the misdiagnosis rates can be reduced, and the proposed model can be used as a retrospective evaluation tool to validate positive COVID-19 infection cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Deep feature extraction; Deep learning; Machine learning; Medical decision support system","Behavioral research; Convolution; Decision making; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Transfer learning; Bayesian optimization; Bayesian optimization algorithms; Computer aided modeling; Convolution neural network; Decision making process; Discriminative features; Machine learning models; Retrospective evaluations; Learning systems",,"Appl.

The model naturally captures the phase transitions of the epidemic growth rate via change-points and further enjoys great interpretability due to its semiparametric nature. On the methodological front, we advance the nascent self-normalization (SN) technique (Shao, 2010) to testing and estimation of a single change-point in the linear trend of a nonstationary time series. We further combine the SN-based change-point test with the NOT algorithm (Baranowski et al., 2019) to achieve multiple change-point estimation. Using the proposed method, we analyze the trajectory of the cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for 30 major countries and discover interesting patterns with potentially relevant implications for effectiveness of the pandemic responses by different countries. Furthermore, based on the change-point detection algorithm and a flexible extrapolation function, we design a simple two-stage forecasting scheme for COVID-19 and demonstrate its promising performance in predicting cumulative deaths in the U.S. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Growth rate; Piecewise linear techniques; Change point detection; Change-points; Interpretability; Linear trends; Multiple changes; Non-stationary time series; Piecewise linear; Semiparametric; Time series analysis",,"J Econom",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089085318

In spite of the effects and efforts taken by governments, the pandemic is still uncontrolled in major cities of the world. The proposed technique in this paper introduces a non-intrusive and major screening of vital symptoms and changes in the respiratory organs. Design/methodology/approach: The novel coronavirus or Covid-19 has become a serious threat to social and economic growth of many nations worldwide. The pace of progression was significantly higher in the past two months. Identified by severe respiratory illness, fever and coughs, the disease has been threatening the lives of human society. Early detection and prognosis is absolutely necessary to isolate the potential spreaders of the disease and to control the rate of progression. Findings: Recent studies have highlighted the changes observed in breathing characteristics of infected patients. Respiratory pattern of Covid-19 patients can be differentiated from the respiratory pattern of normal cold/flu affected patients. Tachypnoea is one among the vital signs identified to be distinguishing feature of Covid-19. The proposed respiratory data capture will commence with facial recognition, use of infrared sensors and machine-learning approaches to classify the respiratory patterns, which finally narrows down as a symptom of Covid-19. Originality/value: Proposed system produced outcome of 94% accuracy, precision, recall and a F1-measure as an average in the conducted experiments.

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images.

The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings3. Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data4,5, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,,"Nature",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085062703

During this lockdown period, everyone is sitting at homes and interacting with others mostly through smartphones. With an exponential increase in Android apps and hence in Android malware, it has become really challenging that how to secure user’s privacy. For this purpose, a number of academicians and researchers have proposed various signature-based and machine learning approaches to detect Android malware. Signature-based approaches can detect only known malware whose signature definitions are already present in its database. On the other hand, machine learning approaches, which were proposed in the literature were developed either with irrelevant features or not able to detect malware which are developed during COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome these issues it becomes highly essential to develop an effective and efficient Android malware detection model. Therefore, in this research paper, 11,000 distinct Android apps are collected, that belong to twelve different categories of Android apps. A total of 1844 unique features from these gathered Android apps are extracted and using ten distinct feature selection approaches irrelevant features have been removed. After that, an Android malware detection framework is developed by using significant features as input and Deep Neural Network (DNN) as machine learning technique. The experiment results reveal that the model developed by using rough set analysis as feature selection approach along with DNN can detect 97.9% malware from real-world apps. © 2020, Research Trend.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges.

In this study, we examined the immune cell compositions in the lung tissues and hilar lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry on 6 deceased COVID-19 patients and 4 focal organizing pneumonia (FOP) patients who underwent lung surgery and served as controls. We found a dominant presence of macrophages and a general deficiency of T cells and B cells in the lung tissues from deceased COVID-19 patients. In contrast to the FOP patients, Tfh cells and germinal center formation were largely absent in the draining hilar lymph nodes in the deceased COVID-19 patients. This was correlated with reduced IgM and IgG levels compared to convalescent COVID-19 patients. In summary, our data highlight a defect of germinal center structure in deceased COVID-19 patients leading to an impaired humoral immunity.

Machine learning (ML) is one of intelligent technique that able to automatically predict the event with reasonable accuracy based on the experience and learning process. In the meantime, a rapid number of ML models have been proposed for predicate the cases of COVID-19. Thus, there is need for an evaluation and benchmarking of COVID-19 ML models which considered the main challenge of this study. Furthermore, there is no single study have addressed the problem of evaluation and benchmarking of COVID diagnosis models. However, this study proposed an intelligent methodology is to help the health organisations in the selection COVID-19 diagnosis system. The benchmarking and evaluation of diagnostic models for COVID-19 is not a trivial process. There are multiple criteria requires to evaluate and some of the criteria are conflicting with each other. Our study is formulated as a decision matrix (DM) that embedded mix of ten evaluation criteria and twelve diagnostic models for COVID-19. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is employed to evaluate and benchmarking the different diagnostic models for COVID19 with respect to the evaluation criteria. An integrated MCDM method are proposed where TOPSIS applied for the benchmarking and ranking purpose while Entropy used to calculate the weights of criteria. The study results revealed that the benchmarking and selection problems associated with COVID19 diagnosis models can be effectively solved using the integration of Entropy and TOPSIS. The SVM (linear) classifier is selected as the best diagnosis model for COVID19 with the closeness coefficient value of 0.9899 for our case study data. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has solved the significant variance for each criterion in terms of ideal best and worst best value, beside issue when specific diagnosis models have same ideal best value. © 2013 IEEE.","benchmarking methodology; chest X-rays images; COVID19 diagnostic; entropy; machine learning; multi-criteria decision-making; TOPSIS","Artificial life; Benchmarking; Decision making; Diagnosis; Disease control; Entropy; Benchmarking methodology; Coefficient values; Evaluation criteria; Intelligent techniques; Multi-criteria decision making; Reasonable accuracy; Selection problems; Specific diagnosis; Learning systems",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086311901

The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for data scientists to model COVID-19, when the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 are yet to be fully explained. The uncertainty around the COVID-19 with no vaccine and effective medicine available until today create additional pressure on the epidemiologists and policy makers. In such a crucial situation, it is very important to predict infected cases to support prevention of the disease and aid in the preparation of healthcare service. In this paper, we have tried to understand the spreading capability of COVID-19 in India taking into account of the lockdown period. The numbers of confirmed cases are increased in India and states in the past few weeks. A differential equation based simple model has been used to understand the pattern of COVID-19 in India and some states.

Although a chest X-Ray scan is a useful candidate tool the images generated by the scans must be analyzed accurately and quickly if large numbers of tests are to be processed. COVID-19 causes bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. In this work, we aim to extract rapidly from chest X-Ray images the similar small regions that may contain the identifying features of COVID-19. This paper therefore proposes a hybrid COVID-19 detection model based on an improved marine predators algorithm (IMPA) for X-Ray image segmentation. The ranking-based diversity reduction (RDR) strategy is used to enhance the performance of the IMPA to reach better solutions in fewer iterations. RDR works on finding the particles that couldn't find better solutions within a consecutive number of iterations, and then moving those particles towards the best solutions so far. The performance of IMPA has been validated on nine chest X-Ray images with threshold levels between 10 and 100 and compared with five state-of-art algorithms: equilibrium optimizer (EO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), sine cosine algorithm (SCA), Harris-hawks algorithm (HHA), and salp swarm algorithms (SSA). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms all other algorithms for a range of metrics. In addition, the performance of our proposed model was convergent on all numbers of thresholds level in the Structured Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) and Universal Quality Index (UQI) metrics. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19 detection; image segmentation; Kapur's entropy; marine predators algorithm; ranking-based reduction diversity","Image segmentation; Viruses; Chest X-ray image; Lung distributions; Number of iterations; Optimization algorithms; Reduction strategy; Similarity indices; Sine-cosine algorithm; X-ray image segmentation; Image enhancement",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084920220

Biopsies of the olfactory epithelium were taken from patients with confirmed COVID-19 as well as uninfected controls. Levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) were assessed using ELISA and compared between groups. Average TNF-α levels were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, no differences in IL-1β were seen between groups. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α were seen in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19.

Studies are increasing to find the best therapeutic approach for the disease and its management. Regenerative medicine offers various cell-tissue therapeutics and related products, such as stem cell therapy, natural killer (NK) cell therapy, Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, exosomes, and tissue products. Interestingly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce inflammatory symptoms and protect against cytokine storm, which critically contributes to the COVID-19 progression. Notably, having the potentials to exert cytotoxic effects on infected cells and induce interferon production probably make NK cells a candidate for COVID-19 cell therapy. Besides, exosomes are one of the crucial products of cells that can exert therapeutic effects through the induction of immune responses and neutralizing antibody titers.

The fake news phenomenon was studied using the Uses and Gratification framework, which was extended by an “altruism” motivation. The data were analysed with Partial Least Squares (PLS) to determine the effects of six variables on the outcome of fake news sharing. Our results showed that altruism was the most significant factor that predicted fake news sharing of COVID-19. We also found that social media users’ motivations for information sharing, socialisation, information seeking and pass time predicted the sharing of false information about COVID-19. In contrast, no significant association was found for entertainment motivation.

While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.

The outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. Thus, identification of regions with high risk for COVID-19 outbreak and analyzing the behaviour of the infection is a major priority of the governmental organizations and epidemiologists worldwide. The aims of the present study were to analyze the risk factors of coronavirus outbreak for identifying the areas having high risk of infection and to evaluate the behaviour of infection in Fars Province, Iran. A geographic information system (GIS)-based machine learning algorithm (MLA), support vector machine (SVM), was used for the assessment of the outbreak risk of COVID-19 in Fars Province, Iran whereas the daily observations of infected cases were tested in the-polynomial and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to examine the patterns of virus infestation in the province and in Iran. The results of the disease outbreak in Iran were compared with the data for Iran and the world. Sixteen effective factors were selected for spatial modelling of outbreak risk. The validation outcome reveals that SVM achieved an AUC value of 0.786 (March 20), 0.799 (March 29), and 86.6 (April 10) that displays a good prediction of outbreak risk change detection. The results of the third-degree polynomial and ARIMA models in the province revealed an increasing trend with an evidence of turning, demonstrating extensive quarantines has been effective. The general trends of virus infestation in Iran and Fars Province were similar, although a more volatile growth of the infected cases is expected in the province.

Meanwhile, the manifestations of COVID-19 as seen through computed tomography (CT) imaging show individual characteristics that differ from those of other types of viral pneumonia such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia (IAVP). This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from IAVP and healthy cases through pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. A total of 618 CT samples were collected: 219 samples from 110 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 50 years; 63 (57.3%) male patients); 224 samples from 224 patients with IAVP (mean age 61 years; 156 (69.6%) male patients); and 175 samples from 175 healthy cases (mean age 39 years; 97 (55.4%) male patients). All CT samples were contributed from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China. First, the candidate infection regions were segmented out from the pulmonary CT image set using a 3D deep learning model. These separated images were then categorized into the COVID-19, IAVP, and irrelevant to infection (ITI) groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores, using a location-attention classification model. Finally, the infection type and overall confidence score for each CT case were calculated using the Noisy-or Bayesian function. The experimental result of the benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy rate was 86.7% in terms of all the CT cases taken together. The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and were demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors. © 2020","Computed tomography; Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia; COVID-19; Location-attention classification model","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Polymerase chain reaction; Bayesian functions; Benchmark datasets; Classification models; Diagnostic methods; Individual characteristics; Learning techniques; Overall accuracies; Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Deep learning",,"Engineering",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087757499

However, DNN classifiers trained on known diseases usually fail when they confront new diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework and pipeline for explainable medical imaging that can classify known diseases as well as detect new/unknown diseases when the models are only trained on known disease images. We first provide in-depth mathematical analysis to explain the overconfidence phenomena and present the calibrated confidence that can mitigate the overconfidence. Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors’ ground truth. While our work was not designed to target COVID-19, our experimental validation using the real world COVID-19 cases/data demonstrates the general applicability of our pipeline for different diseases based on medical imaging. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","COVID-19; DNN confidence calibration; New/unknown disease discovery; Visual explanation","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image analysis; Image understanding; Medical imaging; Pipelines; Chest x-rays; Decision engines; Experimental validations; Ground truth; Large amounts; Learning frameworks; Mathematical analysis; Skin lesion; Diagnosis",,"Commun.

As no vaccine or medical treatment made available till date, the only solution is to detect the COVID-19 cases, block the transmission, isolate the infected and protect the susceptible population. In this scenario, the pervasive computing becomes essential, as it is environment-centric and data acquisition via smart devices provides better way for analysing diseases with various parameters. Design/methodology/approach: For data collection, Infrared Thermometer, Hikvision’s Thermographic Camera and Acoustic device are deployed. Data-imputation is carried out by principal component analysis. A mathematical model susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) is implemented for classifying COVID-19 cases. The recurrent neural network (RNN) with long-term short memory is enacted to predict the COVID-19 disease. Findings: Machine learning models are very efficient in predicting diseases. In the proposed research work, besides contribution of smart devices, Artificial Intelligence detector is deployed to reduce false alarms. A mathematical model SIR is integrated with machine learning techniques for better classification. Implementation of RNN with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model furnishes better prediction holding the previous history. Originality/value: The proposed research collected COVID −19 data using three types of sensors for temperature sensing and detecting the respiratory rate. After pre-processing, 300 instances are taken for experimental results considering the demographic features: Sex, Patient Age, Temperature, Finding and Clinical Trials. Classification is performed using SIR mode and finally predicted 188 confirmed cases using RNN with LSTM model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Pervasive computing; Prediction; Sensors; Smart devices",,,"Int.

Method: This is a brief note in which authors rely on various statistics and insights regarding domestic violence since the detection of Covid-19. Based on the available statistics regarding domestic violence prevalence during previous times of uncertainty, the number and nature of domestic violence incidents around the globe, and existing literature, the authors argue that clear links exist between Covid-19 and domestic violence, which also impacts on the economic and social crisis. Results: Countries across the world are battling Covid-19 by enacting measures to reduce the speed of transmission. Multiple reports, however, suggest that such measures are increasing the incidence of domestic violence and not only in number but also in severity. We find that layoffs, loss of income, extended domestic stays, and exposure to habits due to stay-at-home orders are driving up the incidence of domestic violence. Moreover, these domestic violence increases are driving economic and social crises due to the form and severity of the violence, the burden placed on government, a crisis of resources, and decreases in the productivity of workforces. Conclusion: Domestic violence increase resulting from Covid-19 is an indirect driver of economic and social crisis.

The disease is said to be highly contagious with the contact of infected persons. Feared to be air-borne, droplets of body fluids can transmit the disease in a matter of hours. The predominant symptoms of the COVID-19 are high fever, cough, breathing problem, etc. Recent studies have demonstrated the evolution of the disease to hide its symptoms. As it is highly transmissible, this disease might spread at an exponential rate costing the lives of thousands of people. The chain of transmission has to be detected with utmost priority through early detection and isolation of infected people. Automated internet of things (IoT) devices can be used in design and implementation of a prediction scheme for reporting the health-care risks of the patients with various parameters such as temperature, humidity and blood pressure. Design/methodology/approach: IoT is a configuration of multiple autonomous and embedded wireless devices for serving a purpose. Every object possesses an individual identity and will serve to register critical events as entries for future learning and decisions. IoT plays an inevitable role in medical industries, detection of vital signs of diseases and monitoring. Among other life-threatening diseases, a new pandemic is on rise among world nations. COVID-19, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome virus originated from animals in December 2019 and is becoming a serious menace to Governments, despite serious measures of lockdowns. Findings: In this paper, the authors defined an architecture of an IoT system to predict the Covid-19 disease by getting the data from the human through sensors and send the data to the doctor using mobile, computer, etc. The main goal is early health surveillance by predicting COVID-19. Accordingly, the authors are able to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which will help in the early prediction of disease.

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak. © 2013 IEEE.","5G; AI; Blockchain; Coronavirus; COVID-19; global economic impact; IoMT applications; IoT; pandemic; transmission stages; UAVs for disaster management","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Blockchain; Drones; Coronaviruses; Global economies; Health implications; Health-care system; Internet of thing (IOT); World Health Organization; Internet of things",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086139553

The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis will likely accelerate the implementation of automation and create unique problems involving human–automation trust for naïve users of automated technologies in the future. Method: We briefly review factors that can influence the development of human–automation trust amidst and following the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on two theories on human-automation trust and how naïve users develop and maintain their trust in unfamiliar technologies. Results: The current review identifies user workload and perceived risk as critical factors that will impact human–automation trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both theories predict that it is important for naïve users to accumulate and analyze behavioral evidence of automated technologies to maintain appropriate trust levels as the pandemic progresses. Conclusion and application: Theories of human–automation trust inform trajectories of trust development toward unfamiliar technologies for naïve users. In application, manufacturers and distributers should focus on communicating system information effectively to retain users who may be “forced” to use unfamiliar technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","COVID-19; human–automation trust; naïve automation users; trust development","Ergonomics; Human engineering; Automated technology; Critical factors; Perceived risk; System information; Trust level; Automation",,"Hum.

According to the World Economic Forum, fake news is one of the threats in today's societies, since this type of information circulates fast and is often inaccurate and misleading. Moreover, fake-news are far more shared than evidence-based news among social media users and thus, this can potentially lead to decisions that do not consider the individual’s best interest. Drawing from this evidence, the present study aims at comparing the type of tweets and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19 that contain either false or scientific veracious information from February 6 and 7 of 2020. To that end 1923 messages from each social media were retrieved, classified and compared. Results from this analysis show that there is more false news published and shared on Twitter than in Sina Weibo, at the same time science-based evidence is more shared on Twitter than in Weibo but less than false news.

Due to the huge mask demand–supply gap all over the world, the development of user-friendly technologies and methods is urgently needed to effectively extend the service time of masks. In this article, we report a very simple approach for the decontamination of masks for multiple reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used masks were soaked in hot water at a temperature greater than 56 °C for 30 min, based on a recommended method to kill COVID-19 virus by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The masks were then dried using an ordinary household hair dryer to recharge the masks with electrostatic charge to recover their filtration function (the so-called “hot water decontamination + charge regeneration” method). Three kinds of typical masks (disposable medical masks, surgical masks, and KN95-grade masks) were treated and tested. The filtration efficiencies of the regenerated masks were almost maintained and met the requirements of the respective standards. These findings should have important implications for the reuse of polypropylene masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The performance evolution of masks during human wear was further studied, and a company (Zhejiang Runtu Co., Ltd.) applied this method to enable their workers to extend the use of masks. Mask use at the company was reduced from one mask per day per person to one mask every three days per person, and 122 500 masks were saved during the period from 20 February to 30 March 2020. Furthermore, a new method for detection of faulty masks based on the penetrant inspection of fluorescent nanoparticles was established, which may provide scientific guidance and technical methods for the future development of reusable masks, structural optimization, and the formulation of comprehensive performance evaluation standards. © 2020","COVID-19; Decontamination; Green development concept; Masks; Reusable","Decontamination; Electrostatics; Nondestructive examination; Polypropylenes; Protective clothing; Structural optimization; Viruses; Water; Comprehensive performance evaluation; Electrostatic charges; Filtration efficiency; Fluorescent nanoparticles; Penetrant inspection; People's Republic of China; Performance evolutions; Personal protective equipment; Water filtration",,"Engineering",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087754192

Our objective was to examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. Methods: UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40–69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisations for COVID-19 were ascertained between 16th March and 26th April 2020. Results: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 England-based study members. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function – verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend ≤ 0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). Conclusions: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisation for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function, a marker of health literacy, was most robust. © 2020 The Authors","Cohort study; COVID-19; Hospitalisation; Risk factors; UK Biobank",,"32561221","Brain Behav.

Within months of the first reported case in China, the virus has spread worldwide at an unprecedented rate. COVID-19 illustrates that the biomaterials community was engaged in significant research efforts against bacteria and fungi with relatively little effort devoted to viruses. Accordingly, biomaterials scientists and engineers will have to participate in multidisciplinary antiviral research over the coming years. Although tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have historically dominated the field of biomaterials, current research holds promise for providing transformative solutions to viral outbreaks. To facilitate collaboration, it is imperative to establish a mutual language and adequate understanding between clinicians, industry partners, and research scientists. In this article, clinical perspectives are shared to clearly define emerging healthcare needs that can be met by biomaterials solutions. Strategies and opportunities for novel biomaterials intervention spanning diagnostics, treatment strategies, vaccines, and virus-deactivating surface coatings are discussed.

It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations. © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Adolescent; Child; Chronic disease; COVID-19; Pediatric",,,"Enferm.

COVID-19 led to a decrease of anthropogenic activities in Turkey, largely due to lockdown. Changes in the air quality index (AQI) were assessed before and during coronavirus. In this study, the authors investigated the changes of AQI for 2.5 µm particulate matter (PM2.5), a primary air pollutant, as well as ozone, a secondary air pollutant, in Turkey during December 2019, April 2020, and May 2020. Overall, the PM2.5 index improved by 34.5% by the end of April 2020. However, the ozone index increased from 16.8 to 28.8 by the end of April. The increase in ozone is attributed to the reduction of PM levels, which increased sunlight penetration. Before COVID-19, the AQI for Turkey was categorized as unhealthy for sensitive groups (PM2.5 = 103); however, during the pandemic, AQI fell to lower boundaries of the moderate category by May 2020 (PM2.5 = 56.9). Changes in municipal wastewater were also assessed. Municipal wastewater quality and hospital waste generation did not change during the pandemic in Turkey. Therefore, we should not expect COVID-19 risks in treatment plant effluents. This study gives confidence to regulators that when strict measures are implemented, air quality can improve.

Methods: Large entities that support chiropractic education or practice were invited to participate in this report. Leaders of various entities were emailed an invitation. A designee who was assigned by the leader provided a brief synopsis of actions the entity had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only entities that responded are included in this report. Results: Five entities agreed to participate: The Council on Chiropractic Education, Association of Chiropractic Colleges, Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, and the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company. Common themes included (1) recognizing the crisis and taking action, (2) establishing a safe working environment for staff so that services could continue, (3) delivering communications to stakeholders (chiropractic students, practitioners, licensing boards, and others) to guide decisions and direct actions, and (4) continuing to monitor the situation and respond as new information becomes available. Conclusion: These entities serve a large portion of the chiropractic profession. They have been quick to respond in a responsible, compassionate, and supportive manner to assist chiropractic licensing boards, practitioners, and students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are encouraging as the chiropractic profession looks to the future as it navigates changes in education and the health care environment in the months and years ahead. © 2020","Chiropractic; COVID-19; Health Occupations; Pandemics",,,"J.

This variability is sensed by electrocardiograms observed from a multi-parameter monitor and electronic wearable. This field of interest has evolved into a wide area of investigation with today’s advancement in technology of internet of things for immediate sensing and processing information about profound pain. A window span is estimated and reports of profound pain data are used for monitoring heart rate variability (HRV). A median heart rate is considered for comparisons with a diverse range of variable information obtained from sensors and monitors. Observations from healthy patients are introduced to identify how root mean square of difference between inter beat intervals, standard deviation of inter-beat intervals and mean heart rate value are normalized in HRV analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The function of a human heart relates back to the autonomic nervous system, which organizes and maintains a healthy maneuver of inter connected organs. HRV has to be determined for analyzing and reporting the status of health, fitness, readiness and possibilities for recovery, and thus, a metric for deeming the presence of COVID-19. Identifying the variations in heart rate, monitoring and assessing profound pain levels are potential lives saving measures in medical industries. Findings: Experiments are proposed to be done in electrical and thermal point of view and this composition will deliver profound pain levels ranging from 0 to 10. Real time detection of pain levels will assist the care takers to facilitate people in an aging population for a painless lifestyle. Originality/value: The presented research has documented the stages of COVID-19, symptoms and a mechanism to monitor the progress of the disease through better parameters. Risk factors of the disease are carefully analyzed, compared with test results, and thus, concluded that considering the HRV can study better in the presence of ignorance and negligence. The same mechanism can be implemented along with a global positioning system (GPS) system to track the movement of patients during isolation periods. Despite the stringent control measurements for locking down all industries, the rate of affected people is still on the rise. To counter this, people have to be educated about the deadly effects of COVID-19 and foolproof systems should be in place to control the transmission from affected people to new people. Medications to suppress temperatures, will not be sufficient to alter the heart rate variations, and thus, the proposed mechanism implemented the same. The proposed study can be extended to be associated with Government mobile apps for regular and a consortium of single tracking. Measures can be taken to distribute the low-cost proposal to people for real time tracking and regular updates about high and medium risk patients. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Detection; Heart rate monitoring; Internet of things; Pandemic; Symptom",,,"Int.

To reduce the spread of the virus, governments have introduced crisis management interventions that include border closures, quarantines, strict social distancing, marshalling of essential workers and enforced homeworking. COVID-19 measures are necessary to save the lives of some of the most vulnerable people within society, and yet in parallel they create a range of negative everyday effects for already marginalized people. Likely unintended consequences of the management of the COVID-19 crisis include elevated risk for workers in low-paid, precarious and care-based employment, over-representation of minority ethnic groups in case numbers and fatalities, and gendered barriers to work. Drawing upon feminist ethics of care, I theorize a radical alternative to the normative assumptions of rationalist crisis management. Rationalist approaches to crisis management are typified by utilitarian logics, masculine and militaristic language, and the belief that crises follow linear processes of signal detection, preparation/prevention, containment, recovery and learning. By privileging the quantifiable — resources and measurable outcomes — such approaches tend to omit considerations of pre-existing structural disadvantage. This article contributes a new theorization of crisis management that is grounded in feminist ethics to provide a care-based concern for all crisis affected people. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","COVID-19; crisis management; ethics of care; feminism",,,"Gender Work Organ.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087458771

Among the new approaches that could be tested, that relying on nanotechnology finds one of its main grounds in the similarity between nanoparticle (NP) and coronavirus (COV) sizes, which promotes NP-COV interactions. Since COVID-19 is very recent, most studies in this field have focused on other types of coronavirus than COVID-19, such as those involved in MERS or SARS diseases. Although their number is limited, they have led to promising results on various COV using a wide range of different types of nanosystems, e.g., nanoparticles, quantum dos, or nanoassemblies of polymers/proteins. Additional efforts deserve to be spent in this field to consolidate these findings. Here, I first summarize the different nanotechnology-based methods used for COV detection, i.e., optical, electrical, or PCR ones, whose sensitivity was improved by the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, I present vaccination methods, which comprise nanoparticles used either as adjuvants or as active principles. They often yield a better-controlled immune response, possibly due to an improved antigen presentation/processing than in non-nanoformulated vaccines. Certain antiviral approaches also took advantage of nanoparticle uses, leading to specific mechanisms such as the blocking of virus replication at the cellular level or the reduction of a COV induced apoptotic cellular death. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,"32639742","Bioconjugate Chem.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088112956

Despite the resurgences in positive cases after reopening businesses in May, the country is seeing a shift in mindset surrounding the pandemic as people have been eagerly trickling out from federally-mandated quarantine into restaurants, bars, and gyms across America. History can teach us about the past, and today’s pandemic is no exception. Without a vaccine available, three lessons from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic may arm us in our fight against COVID-19. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity to the second wave, highlighting the potential of passive immunity-based treatments like convalescent plasma and cell-based therapy. Second, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are unknown. Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality. Human behavior is the most important strategy for preventing the virus spread and we must adhere to proper precautions. This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology and treatment for COVID-19 and highlight similarities between past pandemics. By revisiting history, we hope to emphasize the importance of human behavior and innovative therapies as we wait for the development of a vaccine.

In response, countries are implementing societal measures aimed at curtailing transmission of SARS-CoV-22,3. Despite these measures, the COVID-19 epidemic could still result in millions of deaths as local health facilities become overwhelmed4. Advances in malaria control this century have been largely due to distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)5, with many SSA countries having planned campaigns for 2020. In the present study, we use COVID-19 and malaria transmission models to estimate the impact of disruption of malaria prevention activities and other core health services under four different COVID-19 epidemic scenarios. If activities are halted, the malaria burden in 2020 could be more than double that of 2019. In Nigeria alone, reducing case management for 6 months and delaying LLIN campaigns could result in 81,000 (44,000–119,000) additional deaths. Mitigating these negative impacts is achievable, and LLIN distributions in particular should be prioritized alongside access to antimalarial treatments to prevent substantial malaria epidemics. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,,"Nat.

Objectives: To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results: A total of 1189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n = 4) and China (n = 4). The most common type of publication were letters (n = 4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n = 8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n = 7), through one-to-one contact (n = 11), telephone (n = 6) or video conference (n = 5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n = 7) as well as patient counseling (n = 8). Conclusions: A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and/or other pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Pharmaceutical services; Pharmacists; Review",,,"Res.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the governments of hundreds of countries to apply several heavy restrictions in the citizens' socio-economic life. Italy was one of the most affected countries with long-term restrictions, impacting the socio-economic tissue. During this lockdown period, people got informed mostly on Online Social Media, where a heated debate followed all main ongoing events. In this scenario, the following study presents an in-depth analysis of the main emergent topics discussed during the lockdown phase within the Italian Twitter community. The analysis has been conducted through a general purpose methodological framework, grounded on a biological metaphor and on a chain of NLP and graph analysis techniques, in charge of detecting and tracking emerging topics in Online Social Media, e.g. streams of Twitter data. A term-frequency analysis in subsequent time slots is pipelined with nutrition and energy metrics for computing hot terms by also exploiting the tweets quality information, such as the social influence of the users. Finally, a co-occurrence analysis is adopted for building a topic graph where emerging topics are suitably selected. We demonstrate via a careful parameter setting the effectiveness of the topic tracking system, tailored to the current Twitter standard API restrictions, in capturing the main sociopolitical events that occurred during this dramatic phase. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19; infodemiology; infoveillance; Natural language processing; social network analysis; text mining; topic detection; topic tracking","Data streams; Electric grounding; Quality control; Social networking (online); Text processing; Co-occurrence analysis; In-depth analysis; Methodological frameworks; Online social medias; Parameter setting; Quality information; Social influence; Socio-economics; Economic and social effects",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089310340

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in March 2020 to wear a face-covering to prevent people from breathing out tiny droplets that may contain the virus. Properly wearing a face mask means the virus transmission can be lowered. However, watching every person in a crowded area for who is properly wearing or who is not wearing a face mask is a daunting task. This study aims to process face images in a video frame and detects if a person is wearing a mask, not properly wearing a mask (nostrils are visible), and not wearing a mask at all. Using an inception network trained with 4,789 face images with three classifications, the model was able to classify faces with 98.5% accuracy using the training images and 98.8% accuracy using the validation images. All of the training images are black and white images with 16✕16 pixels of resolution.

This study aimed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on orthodontists and orthodontic residents in Nigeria. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among consenting orthodontists and orthodontic residents. The respondents were contacted through the WhatsApp group of the Nigerian Association of Orthodontists to fill the self-administered online questionnaires (Google forms). The questionnaire had two sections: A, Sociodemographics; B, Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to compute mean and standard deviation and chi-square for association. Level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Results: This study population comprised 98 people; however, only 73 participants responded, which represented a response rate of 74.5%. Approximately 60% (44) of the respondents thought that the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a reduction in the number of orthodontic patients in the future, whereas almost all the respondents reported that it would affect their future practice of orthodontics. Most of the respondents (63.0%) reported that the pandemic had recorded a moderate to severe negative economic impact on them. Significant gender differences were recorded, in the social life of respondents, in addition to economic and psychosocial effects. Conclusions: Almost all respondents reported that they would change their future practice of orthodontics, particularly with respect to placing a greater emphasis on infection control.

The present investigation explores the transmissibility of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using some suitable mathematical models such as (a) a simplified Bats-Hosts-Reservoir (Wuhan Seafood Market)-People (BHRP) transmission network model useful in mapping the spread of the novel COVID-19 from its source (may be bats) to humans, (b) a concise baseline model based on individual behavioral response and control measures taken to control the transmission of the novel COVID-19 and (c) an exponential and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models to predict the transmission of the pandemic on day-to-day basis. The basic Reproduction number (R0) (for the next generation matrix) was derived to estimate the transmission of the novel COVID-19 using the simplified BHRP transmission network model. The logic estimates that around 2.30 persons could be affected by the reservoir and around 3.58 persons could be affected by the community (individual person to community population). On the other hand, the concise model based on real-time time-dependent data, such as day-to-day number of tests, appreciates the initiatives (control measures) of the Chinese government to break the transmission chain of the pandemic in the capital city of Hubei province. Furthermore, the basic Reproduction number (R0) for India is reviewed to be in the range between 1.4 and 3.9 using the classical SIR model and thus, the transmission rate is the same as that of California and Washington. The review also outlines the epidemiological SIR model (based on real-time time-dependent data) which estimates about the equilibrium stage of t he pandemic by the last week of May, 2020. The predictions of the age-structured epidemiological SIR model could be more accurate if data such as day-to-day number of tests are correctly fed during evaluation of the results. The present investigation emphasizes over the need of effective implementation of mitigatory strategies such as social distancing to prevent the transmission of the SARS-CoV2 outbreak in India. © 2020 Eva Gupta and Nand Jee Kanu.","COVID-19; Model; Novel Coronavirus; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2; Transmission",,,"Rev.

The basic reproduction number (R0) of infection is variable in different populations and periods. This study aimed to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in Qom, Iran, and compare it with that in other countries. For estimation of the serial interval, we used data of the 51 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their 318 close contacts in Qom, Iran. The number of confirmed cases daily in the early phase of the outbreak and estimated serial interval were used for R0 estimation. We used the time-varying method as a method with the least bias to estimate R0 in Qom, Iran, and in China, Italy and South Korea. The serial interval was estimated with a gamma distribution, a mean of 4.55 days and a standard deviation of 3.30 days for the COVID-19 epidemic based on Qom data. The R0 in this study was estimated to be between 2 and 3 in Qom. Of the four countries studied, the lowest R0 was estimated in South Korea (1.5–2) and the highest in Iran (4–5). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R0 is sensitive to the applied mean generation time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to estimate R0 in Qom. To control the epidemic, the reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the contact rate, decreasing the transmission probability and decreasing the duration of the infectious period. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","basic reproduction number; Coronavirus Infections; COVID-19; disease outbreaks; pandemics",,"32473049","Transboundary Emer.

Uniquely in recent times, governments have imposed partly voluntary, partly compulsory restrictions on the population to slow the spread of the virus. In this context, public attitudes and behaviors are vitally important for reducing the death rate. Analyzing tweets about the disease may therefore give insights into public reactions that may help guide public information campaigns. This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about Covid-19 from March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction: gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare, whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global spread of the virus, and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the population safe. The detailed results may be useful to inform public information announcements and to help understand the spread of the virus.

SuPAR, the soluble form of uPAR, represents a biomarker of disease progression, and its levels correlate well with comorbidities associated with the death of patients with coronavirus. New drugs that regulate the uPA/uPAR system could help treat the severe complications of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (hCoVs), including pandemic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

Whereas some infectious diseases are localized owing to the unique geospatial and biochemical characteristics of the aetiologic agents, others are not bound by such restrictions hence their manifest tendencies towards evolving an epidemic or even a pandemic. CoVID-19 sprang up in Wuhan China in November 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the in January 2020 World Health Organization (WHO). Like the Spanish flu of 1918 that claimed millions of lives, the COVID-19 has caused the demise of thousands with China, Italy, Spain and the USA having the highest statistics on infection and mortality rates. Regardless of existing sophisticated technologies and medical science, the spread has continued to surge high. Tracking of suspected carriers (cases) has been difficult, thereby increasing the risk of spread. As a novel infection, real-time information management beyond national geographical borders is vital to the success of any disease management campaign. Currently, information on the Covid-19 and applicable management procedures in most countries is limited thus creating a knowledge and management gap among the populace and even health management personnel especially in areas susceptible to the pandemic. In response to the aforementioned, this paper proposes an Alert and Tracking System (CVATS) that enhances information dissemination, disease management, tracking of cases, and management of confirmed cases. The system follows an object-oriented approach in articulating the various actors and evolves a model that could be implemented on both web and mobile platforms. On mobile platform, it employs google maps and could be used to track persons as well as geographical areas with prevalence of infections. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies. Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation. This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic.

Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs.

This effect becomes more challenging for the manufacturers of high-demand and most essential items, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer. In a pandemic situation, the demand of the essential products increases expressively; on the other hand, the supply of the raw materials decreases considerably with a constraint of production capacity. These dual disruptions impact the production process suddenly, and the process can collapse without immediate and necessary actions. To minimize the impacts of these dual disruptions, we aim to develop a recovery model for making a decision on the revised production plan. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors use a mathematical modeling approach to develop a production recovery model for a high-demand and essential item during the COVID-19. The authors also analyze the properties of the recovery plan, and optimize the recovery plan to maximize the profit in the recovery window. Findings: The authors analyze the results using a numerical example. The result shows that the developed recovery model is capable of revising the production plan in the situations of both demand and supply disruptions, and improves the profit for the manufacturers. The authors also discuss the managerial implications, including the roles of digital technologies in the recovery process. Originality/value: This model, which is a novel contribution to the literature, will help decision-makers of high-demand and essential items to make an accurate and prompt decision in designing the revised production plan to recover during a pandemic, like COVID-19. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Digital technologies; Mathematical model; Pandemic; Recovery plan; Supply chains",,,"Int.

The significant value of community pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Objective: The assessment of community pharmacies preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional interview survey of 1018 community pharmacies working in four regions of Egypt (South, East, Centre, and North). Data collection was conducted from 8–19 April 2020. Results: Availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medication was better than alcohol (70% conc.). Home delivery services were available in 49.1% of pharmacies. Infection control measures covering interactions between staff were in place in up to 99.5% of pharmacies. Conversely, there was less frequent availability of contactless payment (29.1%), hand sanitizers (62.1%) or masks (86.5%) for customer use, or a separate area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (64%). Verbal customer education (90.4%) was used preferably to written (81.3%). Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%–99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P < 0.001; pandemic training p < 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046). Conclusions: Government and policymakers strive to mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication. More attention should be given to infection control measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are fit and able to provide continuity in their important role. Educating customers using regularly-updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy. Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures. By avoiding under-reporting or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national spread of infection. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Community pharmacy; COVID-19; Cross-sectional survey; Egypt; Pandemic",,,"Res.

The related Basidiomycota Agaricus blazei Murill (AbM), Hericium erinaceus (HE), and Grifola frondosa (GF) have been shown to exert antimicrobial activity against viral agents, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and parasites in vitro and in vivo. Since the mechanism is immunomodulatory and not antibiotical, the mushrooms should be active against multi-drug resistant microbes as well. Moreover, since these Basidiomycota also have anti-inflammatory properties, they may be suited for treatment of the severe lung inflammation that often follows COVID-19 infection. An AbM-based mushroom extract (Andosan™), also containing HE and GF, has been shown to significantly reduce bacteraemia and increase survival in mice with pneumococcal sepsis, and to improve symptoms and quality of life in IBD patients via an anti-inflammatory effect.

First, I show that the model is poorly identified from the observed number of deaths and confirmed cases. There are many sets of parameters that are observationally equivalent in the short run but lead to markedly different long run forecasts. Second, I show that the basic reproduction number R0 can be identified from the data, conditional on epidemiologic parameters, and propose several nonlinear SUR approaches to estimate R0. I examine the performance of these methods using Monte Carlo studies and demonstrate that they yield fairly accurate estimates of R0. Next, I apply these methods to estimate R0 for the US, California, and Japan, and document heterogeneity in the value of R0 across regions. My estimation approach accounts for possible underreporting of the number of cases. I demonstrate that if one fails to take underreporting into account and estimates R0 from the reported cases data, the resulting estimate of R0 may be biased downward and the resulting forecasts may exaggerate the long run number of deaths. Finally, I discuss how auxiliary information from random tests can be used to calibrate the initial parameters of the model and narrow down the range of possible forecasts of the future number of deaths. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Parameter identification; Seemingly unrelated equations; SEIR model","Cell proliferation; Epidemiology; Monte Carlo methods; Auxiliary information; Basic reproduction number; California; Epidemic modeling; Estimation approaches; Initial parameter; Random tests; Run numbers; Forecasting",,"J Econom",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089149436

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. Purpose: This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: Hemogram exams data from 510 symptomatic patients (73 positives and 437 negatives) were used to model and predict qRT-PCR results through Naïve-Bayes algorithms. Different scarcity scenarios were simulated, including symptomatic essential workforce management and absence of diagnostic tests. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Results: Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, yielding a 100% sensitivity and 22.6% specificity with a prior of 0.9999; 76.7% for both sensitivity and specificity with a prior of 0.2933; and 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a prior of 0.001. Regarding background scarcity context, resources allocation can be significantly improved when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. Conclusions: Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.

In this paper, we synthesize the state-of-the-art, up to early June 2020, on key developments regarding public transportation and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the different responses adopted by governments and public transportation agencies around the world, and the research needs pertaining to critical issues that minimize contagion risk in public transportation in the so-called post-lockdown phase. While attempts at adherence to physical distancing (which challenges the very concept of mass public transportation) are looming in several countries, the latest research shows that for closed environments such as public transportation vehicles, the proper use of face masks has significantly reduced the probability of contagion. The economic and social effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in public transportation extend beyond service performance and health risks to financial viability, social equity, and sustainable mobility. There is a risk that if the public transportation sector is perceived as poorly transitioning to post-pandemic conditions, that viewing public transportation as unhealthy will gain ground and might be sustained. To this end, this paper identifies the research needs and outlines a research agenda for the public health implications of alternative strategies and scenarios, specifically measures to reduce crowding in public transportation. The paper provides an overview and an outlook for transit policy makers, planners, and researchers to map the state-of-affairs and research needs related to the impacts of the pandemic crisis on public transportation. Some research needs require urgent attention given what is ultimately at stake in several countries: restoring the ability of public transportation systems to fulfill their societal role. © 2020 Alejandro Tirachini and Oded Cats.","COVID-19 virus transmission; Public health; Resilience; Safety; Sustainability",,,"J.

This study aimed to collect and analyse available information on COVID-19 and avian corona viruses in order to conduct a systematic review of the genetic data concerning them. Methods. All available research was done according to the strictest data selection criteria, and the databases like NCBI genebank were quantitatively searched in the currently available scientific literature using keywords, analytical statistic and genomic software. All studies on the coronavirus family were dedicated to provide an overview towards an advanced statistical analysis of the collected data. The first step was a descriptive study of COVID-19 and avian corona viruses by an epidemiological comparison between the two cases. Results. All corona viruses usually tend to have relatively A-T rich DNAs which is linked to their highly A-T rich codon biases. The results indicate genetic differences between the two viruses, but the results of a percentage analysis showed that the nucleotides A+T are both more abundant and energetically cheaper than nucleotides G+C, this gives viruses a selection advantage. Conclusion. These results give us a future positive view of this type of virus with AT-rich genomes which is selectively promoted at the host level. Recommendation. A recommendation by our study reveals that thought about the vaccine is very early but prevention has proven to be effective for this virus in chickens. © 2020 Scienceline Publication.","Avian corona virus; COVID-19; Epidemiological comparison; Genomic analysis",,,"J.

It should therefore have been no surprise that the infection caused by COVID-19 spread so quickly from the metropolitan city of Wuhan, China, to the whole world. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic represents the biggest health crisis for many countries since the postwar period. The aggressiveness of the virus quickly led many countries to bring in strict containment measures to limit the spread of the disease and particularly to reduce pressure on hospitals. Pandemics affect the health care community in different ways, but all involve a bigger flow of patients into the system, compromising the proper functioning of hospitals. Italy was the first Western country to be heavily affected by the virus. This article describes how Italian health care organizations are facing the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey administered to health management experts highlights the main problems and possible ways for health care organizations to cope with the health crisis more effectively. Results highlight that the COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on health care organizations, forcing all hospitals to modify structures and processes to guarantee an efficacious response to new patient care needs. The lack of specialized resources, appropriate coordination tools, and clear plans for emergency management were the main problems faced by hospitals.

This research was conducted using data from President Jokowi’s tweets (@jokowi) related to Covid-19 from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. The number of tweets analysed was 150 tweets related to coronavirus from a total of 290 tweets. These tweets were collected automatically with the help of the Ncapture and NVIVO 12 analysis tools. However, the researcher also re-checked the data manually. The collected data is then encoded using Microsoft Excel. Finally, the data was analysed using quantitative content analysis. The results found that Jokowi has provided a wide variety of information, ranging from socialising policies related to the handling of COVID-19 in Indonesia to the extension of condolences to the affected patients. The use of photos and videos is also carried out by Jokowi to increase public awareness. Unfortunately, disaster communications were not carried out in advance before the pandemic occurred. It was only actively carried out when the pandemic had claimed many victims. Furthermore, coordination with many parties in providing the information is also crucial. Finally, Jokowi should use a hashtag (#) more often to reach a wider range of tweets. © 2020, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

We are interested in what benefits facemasks could offer as a nonpharmaceutical intervention, especially in the settings where high-technology interventions, such as contact tracing using mobile apps or rapid case detection via molecular tests, are not sustainable. Here, we report the results of two mathematical models and show that facemask use by the public could make a major contribution to reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our intention is to provide a simple modelling framework to examine the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics when facemasks are worn by the public, with or without imposed ‘lock-down’ periods. Our results are illustrated for a number of plausible values for parameter ranges describing epidemiological processes and mechanistic properties of facemasks, in the absence of current measurements for these values. We show that, when facemasks are used by the public all the time (not just from when symptoms first appear), the effective reproduction number, Re, can be decreased below 1, leading to the mitigation of epidemic spread. Under certain conditions, when lock-down periods are implemented in combination with 100% facemask use, there is vastly less disease spread, secondary and tertiary waves are flattened and the epidemic is brought under control. The effect occurs even when it is assumed that facemasks are only 50% effective at capturing exhaled virus inoculum with an equal or lower efficiency on inhalation. Facemask use by the public has been suggested to be ineffective because wearers may touch their faces more often, thus increasing the probability of contracting COVID-19. For completeness, our models show that facemask adoption provides population-level benefits, even in circumstances where wearers are placed at increased risk. At the time of writing, facemask use by the public has not been recommended in many countries, but a recommendation for wearing face-coverings has just been announced for Scotland. Even if facemask use began after the start of the first lock-down period, our results show that benefits could still accrue by reducing the risk of the occurrence of further COVID-19 waves. We examine the effects of different rates of facemask adoption without lock-down periods and show that, even at lower levels of adoption, benefits accrue to the facemask wearers. These analyses may explain why some countries, where adoption of facemask use by the public is around 100%, have experienced significantly lower rates of COVID-19 spread and associated deaths. We conclude that facemask use by the public, when used in combination with physical distancing or periods of lock-down, may provide an acceptable way of managing the COVID-19 pandemic and re-opening economic activity. These results are relevant to the developed as well as the developing world, where large numbers of people are resource poor, but fabrication of home-made, effective facemasks is possible. A key message from our analyses to aid the widespread adoption of facemasks would be: ‘my mask protects you, your mask protects me’. © 2020 The Authors.

Coronaviruses are structurally large-sized single-stranded RNA viruses. The capability of regular therapies is constantly fading away exactly in case of coronavirus due to the modification of new strain, which could be certainly due to speedyadaptation in a protein sequence. The scientist should understand the pandemic situation of virus infection, also as they ought to identify the newest pathway research to regulate the virus infection.

In the last few years, several new smart drug delivery approaches made the changeover from the laboratory development to clinical applications. At present technology, researchers provide effective and low toxicity drug delivery when compared with classical delivery. This approach will be a great opportunity for the scientist to work and update preclinical research of advance drug delivery systems to cloneable and convertible production to the human trial success rate. In conclusion, by understanding the new drug delivery research approaches for antiviral therapy are increases to produce safe and high-quality therapies at reasonable costs. © 2020.","Covid-19 Infection; Nano-based antiviral therapy; Smart drug delivery approach; Virus killer",,,"Int.

The main characteristic of coronaviruses is a high mutation rate, resulting in possible changes in their pathogenicity, tissue tropism or in their host. Even though they have been known causes of disease for decades, they became interesting in the 21st century due to outbreaks of large epidemics in humans and causing serious economic losses in the animal production sector, primarily the pig industry. The outbreaks of the highest concern emerged in 2002 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ‒ SARS) and in 2012 (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome ‒ MERS). Both diseases are of animal origin, and manifested with severe pneumonia in humans and a lethality of 11% and 36%, respectively. Today we are confronted with one of the largest epidemics in the history of humankind, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is caused by a variant of the SARS coronavirus and transmitted through person to person contact, with no known animal vector. Until the time of press of this article the infection has been detected in over 4.8 million people and has been the cause of over 320,000 deaths. In Croatia, due to protective measures imposed by the National Civil Protection Headquarters, COVID-19 is still within linear case growth.

This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of liquid modernity. We then apply the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy. We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors.

There is hardly a country in the world that is not currently facing this problem. The number of cases is constantly growing, patients and carriers being the main mode of transmission. The economies of all countries are at stake. However, people need essential goods and food, regardless of the situation. In this respect, agriculture, food industry, food market, and catering have become priority industries. A continuous operation of food service enterprises (FSE) is crucial for the uninterrupted food supply in the period of preventive measures. The paper describes how pathogen makes its way into FSEs, spreads, and infects people. This information makes it possible to assess the probability of coronavirus infection and to reduce its spread, thus ensuring the safe operation of the enterprise. There are three transmission routes the coronavirus can take at a FSE: (1) aerial transmission by droplets and aerosols during the main and secondary technological production processes, (2) person-to-person transmission from clients to staff or from employee to employee via direct or indirect contact, (3) transmission via contaminated surfaces, e.g. packaging, furniture, equipment, etc. FSEs have to follow the recommendations published by the federal and/or local authorities, which may vary depending on the COVID-19 incidence rate in the area. These recommendations are based on the probability of the public health risk associated with person-to-person transmission, rather than on food safety. © 2020, Mayurnikova et al.","Containment; Coronavirus COVID-19; Food service enterprises; Preventive measures; Recommendations",,,"Foods Raw Mater.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089037791

Due to the risk that food can also be a medium to cause virus diseases, the procedures in the food industry safety programs must be revised; and, to be more specific, to disinfect Covid-19. Some effective disinfectants that have been proved to inactivate the coronavirus are: chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, quaternary compound, ozone and UV-C (shortwave ultraviolet light). In this review, some treatments used to inactivate a virus, with an emphasis to the coronavirus family, and other influenza viruses, are reported. It has been concluded that the coronavirus could be inactivated using free chlorine solutions at 30 mg/L, sodium hypochlorite 0.25 %, or Chlorine Dioxide (99% purity) diluted at 1/2.5 relation. Also, alcohol is an effective disinfectant at concentrations of 62 to 71% of ethanol. With respect to the use of the quaternary compound, it can be used at concentrations of 0.10%. Ozone is another promising disinfectant to inactivate the coronavirus and Covid-19. Doses of ozone between 10 to 20 ppm for 10 to 15 minutes are recommended to inactivate the coronavirus with 3.5 log10 reductions. However, a warning should be reported to the use of high doses of exposure because it can be a risk to human health. UV-C can inactivate the coronavirus at a value of 67 J/m2 by 1 to 30 minutes of exposure. © 2020 All rights reserved.","COVID-19; Food safety; Hypochlorite; Ozone; SARS-CoV; Ultraviolet light; UV-C Radiation",,,"Scientia Agropecu.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087273029

She has recently completed her second PhD in Social Sciences (Northumbria University). She also acted as post-doctoral researcher at the Desertification Research Centre (University of Sassari, Italy) investigating the adaptive capacity of some communities to climate change impact. This paper analyses the first phases of the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak management in Italy by exploring the combination of political, scientific, media and public responses. A lack of coordination between political and scientific levels, and between institutional claim-makers and the media, suggests a mismanagement of the crisis during the first phases of the outbreak. The outbreak management suffered from the five communication weaknesses identified by Reynolds, related to i) mixed messages from multiple messengers; ii) delay in releasing information; iii) paternalistic attitudes; iv) lack of immediate reaction to rumours; and v) political confusion. This supports that the communication of uncertainty around an unknown threat should be accompanied by both political and scientific cohesion. However, both political and scientific dysfunctions caused the failure of several government efforts to contain the outbreak. This paper contributes towards informing policymakers on some lessons learned from the management of the Covid-19 in one of the most affected countries in the world. The Italian case study offers the opportunity for other countries to improve the management of the outbreak by limiting the spread of both chaos and panic. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coronavirus; Covid-19; health-crisis management","Engineering; Safety engineering; Adaptive capacity; Climate change impact; Coronaviruses; Government efforts; Paper analysis; Policy makers; Research centres; Reynolds; Climate change",,"J.

This pandemic has caused prosthodontics units to suspend their clinical and educational operations in academia. Purpose: The purpose of this article was to review the experiences from the Department of Prosthodontics, Wuhan University School and Hospital of Stomatology (DP-WHUSHS), during the COVID-19 outbreak and the protocols DP-WHUSHS used to resume clinical activities after the outbreak. Material and methods: The descriptive approach was used in this article to provide a chronological narrative of the experiences and protocols from the DP-WHUSHS during the COVID-19 outbreak and after the outbreak. Results: During the COVID-19 outbreak period, clinical care was provided for patients with dental emergencies by using enhanced grade 2 or grade 3 personal protective equipment (PPE). Teledentistry was used to provide care for patients with nonemergency needs. Online webinars and lectures were conducted for the predoctoral students, residents, and dentists to minimize the interruption in their education and engage the dental community amid the pandemic. Various factors were considered before clinical activities resumed after the outbreak subsided. Additional resources were allocated for facility preparation and management and employee training. New infection control and clinical operation protocols were developed to minimize the health-care–associated infection of airborne transmission diseases. The psychological health and mental wellness of the employees were emphasized. Distance or online education is still under rapid development to provide students and dentists opportunities to advance their knowledge amid the pandemic. Conclusions: Within the limitation of this descriptive review, the following conclusions were drawn. Patient welfare and emergency needs should be considered amid the pandemic. Enhanced grade 2 or grade 3 PPE should be used during the outbreak. Multifactorial considerations for work resumption after the outbreak included facility preparation and management, training for employees, and clinical operation management. In-person psychological consultation and online mental wellness programs were available to employees to improve their mental wellness.

For example, currently, the debate continues to reveal when and where the first spread of COVID-19 occured. For this problem, most of the works have assumed a static network topology, that is, the connections between nodes do not change over time. This is impractical because many nodes have some mobility in the network, or the connections can be changed. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic network, in the sense that the node connectivity varies over time. We first introduce a simple dynamic model, named k-flip dynamic such that k > 0 connections in the network may be changed with some probability at each time. Next, we design a proper estimation algorithm using some investigation for the contact information between infected nodes, named dynamic network source estimation (DNSE)(k) for the dynamic model. We perform various simulations for the algorithm compared to several existing source estimation methods. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms and is efficient for finding the epidemic source compared to other methods.

Most of the countries impose a lockdown system with social distancing measures to arrest the rapid transmission of this virus into the human body. The objective of this study is to examine the status of air quality during and pre-COVID-19 lockdown and to recommend some long-term sustainable environmental management plan. The pollution data like PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2 and CO have been obtained from State Pollution Control Board under Govt. of West Bengal. Similarly, various land surface temperature (LST) maps have been prepared using LANDSAT-8 OLI and LANDSAT-7 ETM + images of USGS. The maps of NO2 and aerosol concentration over Indian subcontinent have been taken from ESA and NASA. The digital thematic maps and diagrams have been depicted by Grapher 13 and Arc GIS 10.3 platforms. The result shows that the pollutants like CO, NO2 and SO2 are significantly decreased, while the average level of O3 has been slightly increased in 2020 during the lockdown due to close-down of all industrial and transport activities. Meanwhile, around 17.5% was the mean reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 during lockdown compared with previous years owing to complete stop of vehicles movement, burning of biomass and dust particles from the construction works. This study recommends some air pollution-tolerant plant species (in urban vacant spaces and roof tops) for long-term cohabitation among environment, society and development. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; Lockdown system; Parameters; Sustainable",,,"Environ.

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO. Overall experimental results confirm that the MPAMFO is an efficient MLT approach that approved its superiority over other existing methods. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19; Image segmentation; marine predators algorithm (MPA); moth-?ame optimization (MFO); multi-level thresholding; swarm intelligence","Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; NP-hard; Optimization; Gray-scale images; Histogram method; Local search method; Multilevel thresholding; Optimum solution; Random sequence; Segmentation techniques; Traditional approaches; Computerized tomography",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088695032

For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10–20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape. A traffic light dashboard for domestic and inbound air travel demand to Spain shows how destination managers might use Big Data relating to the early recovery of key source markets to develop targeted marketing strategies.

The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analyzed using the Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data at Haridwar, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Varanasi stretches of the river. In the present study, it was found that the red and NIR bands are most sensitive, and can be used to estimate the turbidity. Further, the temporal variation in turbidity was also analyzed through normalized difference turbidity index at each location. It was observed that the turbidity in the river has reduced drastically at each stretch of the river.

These hoaxes take advantage of this type of emotion to spread faster than the coronavirus itself, generating fear and distrust in the population. The spread of these lies, part of which circulates on social networks, is dangerous because it affects health and can make the contagion worse and cause people to die. This research aims to analyse and visualise the network created around the false news circulating on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic using the technique of social network analysis. NodeXL Pro software has been used. Several measures of network centrality have been used to generate the network of connections between users, to represent their interaction patterns and to identify the key actors within the network. In addition, a semantic network has also been created to discover the differences in the way groups of people talk about the topic. The results show that the situation in the USA dominates the conversation, despite the fact that at that time there were hardly any cases, and Europe had become the global epicentre of the Covid-19. Despite reports of inaction by journalists and critics of the Trump government, there are several weeks in which disinformation distracts from taking more effective action and actually preventing contagion.

In this rapid-response editorial, we provide an introduction to the framing devices of disease surveillance and discuss how a surveillance studies orientation could help us think critically about the present crisis and its possible aftermath. © The author(s), 2020.",,,,"Surveill.

The last case of rabies in Croatia was recorded in the spring of 2014, just three years after the start of implementation of the national oral rabies vaccination programme. The logical next step is obtaining the official status of a rabies-free country, and consequently transitioning to a new rabies control policy in the country.

Contemporary social media offers almost everyone a platform to publish one’s own thoughts, opinions, political statements and others, some of which may gain significant interest of others and thereby become so called “influencers”. This role has in the past been held by news agencies primarily, but this role is increasingly adopted also by private people and among them, also some who do not necessarily adhere the high standards of good journalism or scientific ethics. These give rise to fake news, spreading as unconfirmed rumors and possibly causing dramatic impacts to a society. With information available almost everywhere in the internet today, the distinction between good and bad sources has become a challenge, and highly difficult task. Even more intricate is the question of verifying information against multiple independent sources. If many people say something, does this make it true or any more plausible? Do we need to trust information in lack of better information? Is it possible to judge information and make our own opinion about its validity, quality, relevance or usefulness for our own business? This article shall provide pointers towards answers to the above questions. We discuss some technical means of judging the quality of information and what anyone, even without much technical background can do to avoid falling victim to fake information and fake news. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Fake news; Influence; Social media",,,"Mind Soc.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089252207

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2019 International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research Co., Ltd.","Adverse events; Chloroquine; COVID-19; FAERS; Pharmacovigilance; Real-world data","chloroquine; aged; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; drug surveillance program; factual database; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; isolation and purification; male; mental disease; middle aged; retrospective study; toxicity and intoxication; United States; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Pharmacovigilance; Retrospective Studies; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration","32321905","BioScience Trends",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084617699

Unfortunately, not all students can benefit from the adoption of such a surrogate of their usual school. We were asked to devise a way to allow a community of children affected by the Rett genetic syndrome, and thus unable to communicate verbally, in writing or by gestures, to actively participate in remote rehabilitation and special education sessions by exploiting eye-gaze tracking. As not all subjects can access commercial eye-tracking devices, we investigated new ways to facilitate the access to eye gaze-based interaction for this specific case. The adopted communication platform is a videoconferencing software, so all we had at our disposal was a live video stream of the child. As a solution to the problem, we developed a software (named SWYG) that only runs at the ""operator"" side of the communication, at the side of the videoconferencing software, and does not require to install other software in the child's computer. The preliminary results obtained are very promising and the software is ready to be deployed on a larger base.

The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours.

In this paper, we theorize a new notion—the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply–demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future.

The filtration performance of five N95FFR models following long-term storage, removal of charge using isopropanol alcohol (IPA), autoclaving, or treatment with gamma-radiation was assessed using a TSI 8130 automated filter tester. Statistically significant differences were found in the penetration (P), pressure drop (Δp) and quality factor (qf) between non-expired and expired N95 models 3M-8210 and 3M-8511. A statistically significant linear correlation was also obtained between the N95 penetration ratio (PR) and the difference between year of manufacture and time of test (DYM). The PR of N95 was more strongly influenced by eliminating the charge (for extremely out-of-date respirators) on the electret filter than by the DYM. Sterilization by gamma irradiation increased the P into non-expired and expired N95FFR models (p &lt; 0.05), reducing their qf. The qf of all N95FFR models, except UVEX-3200, was strongly affected by gamma irradiation, the removal of charge using IPA, autoclaving, and storage in that order. All expired models maintained acceptable filtration performance and still could be used to collect aerosol effectively, even though models 3M-8511 and 3M-1860 had been manufactured up to 13 years previously. As the COVID-19 outbreaks in 2019 and is getting worse in 2020, these data are useful in developing a global stockpiling strategy to maximize the longevity of N95FFRs for public health and healthcare workers. However, the aging of the straps and seal materials (rubbers, plastics) of the N95FFRs may affect their fit factor and effectiveness. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Autoclave; COVID-19; Filtration performance; Gamma irradiation; N95; Storage","Aerosols; Digital storage; Electrets; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Respirators; Sterilization (cleaning); Developed countries; Facepiece respirators; Filtration performance; Healthcare workers; Isopropanol alcohols; Linear correlation; N95 filtering facepiece respirators; Statistically significant difference; Storage (materials); aerosol; community health worker; detection method; disease treatment; instrumentation; public health; storage; viral disease; Coronavirus",,"Aerosol Air Qual.

The absence of specific drugs and vaccines, the rapid transmission of the virus, and the increasing number of deaths worldwide necessitated the discovery of new substances for anti-COVID-19 drug development. With the aid of bioinformatics and computational modelling, ninety seven antiviral secondary metabolites from fungi were docked onto five SARS-CoV2 enzymes involved in viral attachment, replication, post-translational modification, and host immunity evasion infection mechanisms followed by molecular dynamics simulation and in silico ADMET prediction (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of the hit compounds. Thus, three fumiquinazoline alkaloids scedapin C (15), quinadoline B (19) and norquinadoline A (20), the polyketide isochaetochromin D1 (8), and the terpenoid 11a-dehydroxyisoterreulactone A (11) exhibited high binding affinities on the target proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 15 (nsp15), and the spike binding domain to GRP78. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to optimize the interaction and investigate the stability of the top-scoring ligands in complex with the five target proteins. All tested complexes were found to have dynamic stability. Of the five top-scoring metabolites, quinadoline B (19) was predicted to confer favorable ADMET values, high gastrointestinal absorptive probability and poor blood-brain barrier crossing capacities.

However we argue that, while detection of cases have still not been reported after 10 days and one million app downloads - a situation comparable to Australia who launched its app a month before -, the adoption of the app generates important risks to our informational privacy, surveillance and habituation to security policies. It also may create discrimination, distrust and generate other health problems such as addiction and others as 5G technology continues to be deployed without prior impact studies. Finally the smartphone app against covid epidemics appears as an extreme case of the privacy paradox where the government plays on the immediate benefits and downplays long-term concerns while inducing a technology of self.

As the current pandemic has affected countries socially and economically, the purpose of this bibliometric analysis is to provide a holistic review of the corona pandemic in the field of social sciences. This study aims to highlight significant, influential aspects, research streams, and themes. We have reviewed 395 journal articles related to coronavirus in the field of social sciences from 2003 to 2020. We have deployed 'biblioshiny' a web-interface of the 'bibliometrix 3.0' package of R-studio to conduct bibliometric analysis and visualization. In the field of social sciences, we have reported influential aspects of coronavirus literature. We have found that the 'Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report' is the top journal. The core article of coronavirus literature is 'Guidelines for preventing health-care-associated pneumonia'. The most commonly used word, in titles, abstracts, author's keywords, and keywords plus, is 'SARS'. Top affiliation is 'The University of Hong Kong'. Hong Kong is a leading country based on citations, and the USA is on top based on total publications. We have used a conceptual framework to identify potential research streams and themes in coronavirus literature. Four research streams are found by deploying a co-occurrence network. These research streams are 'Social and economic effects of epidemic disease', 'Infectious disease calamities and control', 'Outbreak of COVID 19,' and 'Infectious diseases and the role of international organizations'. Finally, a thematic map is used to provide a holistic understanding by dividing significant themes into basic or transversal, emerging or declining, motor, highly developed, but isolated themes. These themes and subthemes have proposed future directions and critical areas of research. © 2013 IEEE.","Bibliometric analysis; biblioshiny; conceptual structure; coronavirus; COVID survey; COVID-19; pandemic; r-studio; SARS; social sciences","Behavioral research; Disease control; Diseases; Maps; Bibliometric analysis; Biological science; Co-occurrence networks; Conceptual frameworks; Conceptual structures; Infectious disease; International organizations; Potential researches; Economic and social effects",,"IEEE Access",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089310056

All theoretical studies are based on uniformly sampled data in the absence of noise. This paper proves that all data from an underlying polynomial model of finite degree q can be represented perfectly by an autoregressive time-series model of order q and a constant term mu as in equation (2). Furthermore, all polynomials of degree q are shown to give rise to the same set of time-series coefficients of specific forms with the only possible difference being in the constant term mu . It is also demonstrated that time-series with either non-integer coefficients or integer coefficients not of the aforementioned specific forms represent polynomials of infinite degree. Six numerical explorations, with both generated data and real data, including the UK data and US data on the current Covid-19 incidence, are presented to support the theoretical findings. It is shown that all polynomials of degree q can be represented by an all-pole filter with q repeated roots (or poles) at z=+1. Theoretically, all noise-free data representable by a finite order all-pole filter, whether they come from finite degree or infinite degree polynomials, can be described exactly by a finite order AR time-series; if the values of polynomial coefficients are not of special interest in any data modelling, one may use time-series representations for data modelling. © 2013 IEEE.","autoregressive processes; Covid-19; Data models; polynomials; signal representation; time-series","Information analysis; Poles; Time series; Autoregressive time series; Integer coefficient; Modelling techniques; Numerical exploration; Polynomial coefficients; Polynomial modeling; Polynomial representations; Theoretical study; Polynomials",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087399758

Design/methodology/approach: The research took the form of a desk study, which analysed various documents and reports such as a 2019 report on Money Mules by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL); a 2019 and 2020 report on Money Mules by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Better Business Bureau (BBB); the Financial Action Task Force Guidance on the Risk Based Approach to Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (High Level Principles and Procedures) 2007; the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations 2012; the United Kingdom’s Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017; the United States Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual 2014; Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index 2018; The UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended); the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part I June 2017 (Amended December 2017); the United States Codified Bank Secrecy Act Regulations (31 CFR); the Nigerian Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 (as amended); and the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group JMLSG, Prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing: Guidance for the UK financial sector Part II: Sectoral Guidance June 2017 (Amended December 2017). Findings: This paper determined that financial institutions may be able to prevent proceeds of crime from being laundered by individuals who have been unknowingly recruited as Money Mules if they focus monitoring resources on the emotionally vulnerable customers like newcomers to the country, unemployed people who may have lost their jobs because of a pandemic like COVID-19, students and those in economic hardship; pay very close attention to the country of origin where the funds emanate from; pay very close attention to the country where the funds are being transferred to; and pay close attention to frequent large cash deposits followed by wire transfers. Originality/value: While most articles focus on the money laundering risk(s) associated with Money Mules and the measures that individuals can use to ensure that their bank accounts are not used by criminals to launder illicit funds, this paper focuses on the different mechanisms that banks can use to detect illicit funds which are being received into the bank accounts of low risk or medium risk customers who are unknowingly recruited as “Money Mules”. This paper recommends a proportional approach that balances anti-money laundering measures, financial inclusion and human rights. The mechanisms/measures which have been extensively discussed in this paper will help banks to identify, assess and understand their money laundering and terrorist financing risks as it relates to Money Mules and take commensurate measures to mitigate them. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoins; COVID-19; Cybercrime; Financial institutions; Money laundering; Money mules",,,"J.

In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms. Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool. Methods: Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified. After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes. Results: Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process. Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process. Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019. Discussion: Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment. © 2020 Emergency Nurses Association","Communicable disease control/methods; Disease outbreaks/prevention and control; Ebola; Emergency service,hospital; Patient isolation",,,"J.

Considering the need for lockdown measures, most countries, including Malaysia, have implemented ‘Movement Control Orders’ (MCOs) as a prevention step to reduce the deadly spread of this disease. Local and worldwide media have reported the immediate improvement of air quality due to this event. Nevertheless, data on the effects of MCOs on air quality at local scales are still sparse. Here, we investigate changes in air quality during the MCO at an urban area using the air sensor network AiRBOXSense which measures monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). In this study, air pollutant data during normal days were compared with MCO days using a reference analyser and AiRBOXSense. The results showed that the levels of the measured pollutants dropped by ~20 to 60% during the MCO days at most locations. However, CO in Kota Damansara (KD) dropped to 48.7%, but PM2.5 and PM10 increased up to 60% and 9.7% respectively during MCO days. Local burning activities in the residential area of KD are believed to be the main cause of the increased PM levels. This study has proven that air pollutant levels have significantly fallen due to the MCO. This air quality level information showed that the reduction of air pollutants can be achieved if traffic and industry emissions are strictly controlled. © The Author(s).","Carbon monoxide; Movement control order; Particulate matters","Air quality; Disease control; Sensor networks; Air pollutants; Air quality levels; Burning activity; Industry emissions; Local scale; Movement control; Particulate Matter; Residential areas; Quality control; air quality; disease spread; particulate matter; urban area; urban pollution; virus; Klang Valley; Malaysia; West Malaysia",,"Aerosol Air Qual.

The setup can be operated as a plug-flow isothermal reactor and enables the control of relevant parameters such as reaction temperature and reactant partial pressures directly from the GC. High-quality kinetic data (including reaction rates, product distributions, and activation barriers) can be obtained at almost one-tenth of the fabrication cost of analogous commercial setups. With these key benefits including automation, low cost, and limited experimental equipment instrumentation, this implementation is intended as a high-throughput catalyst screening reactor that can be readily utilized by materials synthesis researchers to assess the catalytic properties of their synthesized structures in vapor-phase chemistries. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Automation to reduce research labor is an important area in reaction engineering, and reactors capable of operating without manual intervention are sought for rapid catalyst testing. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic provides further impetus to a transition away from labor-intensive material testing techniques to new automated approaches without compromising on data quality, and at costs viable for academic laboratories. Here, we convert common analytical equipment employed in catalysis laboratories, namely a gas chromatograph (GC), into a low-cost packed bed flow reactor that can be operated isothermally. The quality of catalytic data is validated by comparisons with prior reports on more traditional reactors. Ultimately, this user-friendly implementation only requires limited additional instrumentation and cost to GC operation and puts a standardized high-throughput reactor into the hands of materials synthesis researchers for screening their synthesized catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Through simple hardware and software modifications, it is possible to convert a typical gas chromatograph into an automated packed bed reactor capable of accurate kinetic measurements in vapor-phase catalytic chemistries.

Gaze points are analyzed generally in terms of two events of fixations and saccades that are collectively termed as scanpath. Scanpath could potentially establish correlation between visual scenery and human cognitive tendencies. Scanpath has been analyzed for different domains that include visual perception, usability, memory, visual search or low level attributes like color, illumination and edges in an image. Visual search is one prominent area that examines scanpath of subjects while a target object is searched in a given set of images. Visual search explores behavioral tendencies of subjects with respect to image complexity. Complexity of an image is governed by spatial, frequency and color information present in the image. Scanpath based image complexity analysis determines human visual behavior that could lead to development of interactive and intelligent systems. There are several sophisticated eye tracking devices and associated algorithms for recording and classification of scanpath. However, in the present scenario when the chances of viral infections (COVID-19) from known and unknown sources are high, it is very important that the contact less methods and models be designed. In addition, even though the devices acquire and process eye movement data with fair accuracy but are intrusive and costly. The objective of current research work is to establish the complexity of the given set of images while target objects are searched and to present analysis of gaze search pattern. To achieve these objectives a remote gaze estimation and analysis model has been proposed for scanpath identification and analysis. The model is an alternate option for gaze point tracking and scanpath analysis that is non intrusive and low cost. The gaze points are tracked remotely as against sophisticated wearable eye tracking devices available in the market. The model employs easily available softwares and hardware devices. In the current work, complexity is derived on the basis of analysis of fixation and saccade gaze points. Based on the results generated by the proposed model, influence on subjects due to external stimuli is studied. The set of images chosen, act as external stimuli for the subjects during visual search. In order to statistically analyze scanpath for different subjects, certain scanpath parameters have been identified. The model maps and classifies eye movement gaze points into fixations and saccades and generates data for identified parameters. For eye detection and subsequent iris detection voila jones and circular hough transform (CHT) algorithms have been used. Identification by dispersion threshold (I-DT) is implemented for scanpath identification. The algorithms are customized for better iris and scanpath detection. Algorithms are developed for gaze screen mapping and classification of fixations and saccades. The experimentation has been carried on different subjects. Variations during visual search have been observed and analyzed. The present model requires no contact of human subject with any equipment including eye tracking devices, screen or computing devices. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","CHT; Fixation; Gaze; Saccade; Visual search; Voila Jones","Behavioral research; Eye movements; Eye protection; Hough transforms; Image analysis; Intelligent systems; Behavioral patterns; Circular Hough transforms; Eye movement datum; Eye tracking devices; Identified parameter; Image Complexity Analysis; Low-level attributes; Remote gaze estimation; Eye tracking",,"Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086727986

Some changes, such as an increase in anonymity in some financial transactions, facilitate new fraud innovations and increase the possibility of fraud. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic shutdown has fostered major disruptions in relative demands and organizational capital that also increase the likelihood of fraud over the next few years. Viewed over a longer time scale, however, the majority of technological and wealth changes seem likely to increase the use and effectiveness of reputational capital, third-party enforcement, and ethical motivations as fraud deterrents.

However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an opportunity for this approach was not possible. The pandemic has been forcing instructors to explore the remote setting instead of the laboratory. There are several commercially available kits for remote laboratory instruction in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Kits provide students with a majority of necessary items to conduct scientific experiments in their homes. Unfortunately, there are no commercially available kit options for laboratory exercises in an instrumental analysis course. Here, we describe a homemade kit that focuses on two important pillars of instrumental analysis: spectroscopy and chromatography. The total cost of the kit is about 700 USD; this amount can be reduced significantly if a ""do-it-yourself""spectrometer is employed instead of a commercial model.

Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.

Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction.

The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. With the outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, occasional outbreaks of measles and tuberculosis, and the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, it is important to estimate the risks for dental health care workers. Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. This equation incorporated the indoor air quality by using carbon dioxide as a proxy and added the respiratory protection rate from medical face masks and N95 respirators. Scenario-specific analyses, uncertainty analyses, and sensitivity analyses were run to produce probability rates. A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100%), coronaviruses (99.4%), influenza virus (89.4%), and M. tuberculosis (84.0%). The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5% for measles virus and 0% for the other pathogens. From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. The risk magnitude, however, is highly dependent on specific conditions in each dental clinic. Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; cross infection; infection control; infectious disease transmission; respiratory protective devices; theoretical model",,,"J.

It is reported that the infected people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), generally develop mild respiratory symptoms in the early stage. It will be more important to continuously monitor the RR of people in nursing homes and houses with a non-contact method. Conventional, contact-based, methods are not suitable for long-term health monitoring especially in-home care services. The potentials of wireless radio signals for health care applications, such as fall detection, etc., are examined in literature. In this paper, we focus on a device-free real-time RR monitoring system using wireless signals. In our recent study, we proposed a non-contact RR monitoring system with a batch processing (delayed) estimation method. In this paper, for real-time monitoring, we modify the standard joint unscented Kalman filter (JUKF) method for this new and time-critical problem. Due to the nonlinear structure of the RR estimation problem with respect to the measurements, a novel modification is proposed to transform measurement errors into parameter errors by using the hyperbolic tangent function. It is shown in the experiments conducted with the real measurements taken using healthy volunteers that the proposed modified joint unscented Kalman filter (ModJUKF) method achieves the highest accuracy according to the windowing-based methods in the time-varying RR scenario. It is also shown that the ModJUKF not only reduces the computational complexity approximately 8.54% but also improves the accuracy 36.7% with respect to the standard JUKF method. © 2013 IEEE.","device-free; health monitoring; joint unscented Kalman filter; radio signals; respiratory rate tracking; Unscented Kalman filter; vital signs","Batch data processing; Home health care; Hyperbolic functions; Monitoring; Estimation methods; Health care application; Hyperbolic tangent function; Nonlinear structure; Real time monitoring; Respiratory rate estimations; Respiratory symptoms; Unscented Kalman Filter; Kalman filters",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086309415

In cases where data are missing due to imperfect detection of individuals, the associated measurement error can be accommodated under certain study designs (e.g. those that involve multiple surveys or replication). However, the interaction of the measurement error and the underlying dynamic process can complicate the implementation of statistical agent-based models (ABMs) for population demography. In a Bayesian setting, traditional computational algorithms for fitting hierarchical demographic models can be prohibitively cumbersome to construct. Thus, we discuss a variety of approaches for fitting statistical ABMs to data and demonstrate how to use multi-stage recursive Bayesian computing and statistical emulators to fit models in such a way that alleviates the need to have analytical knowledge of the ABM likelihood. Using two examples, a demographic model for survival and a compartment model for COVID-19, we illustrate statistical procedures for implementing ABMs. The approaches we describe are intuitive and accessible for practitioners and can be parallelised easily for additional computational efficiency. © 2020 International Statistical Institute","Bayesian; emulator; individual-based model; MCMC; mechanistic model",,,"Int.

Healthcare institutions cannot neglect the need to monitor and analyze popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. To have a study success, a healthcare giver needs to be able to engage with their patients and adapt to their preferences effectively. However, data-driven decision-making is no longer enough, as the best-in-class organizations struggle to realize tangible benefits from their data-driven analytics investments. Relying on simplistic textual analytics that use big data technologies to learn consumer/patient insights is no longer sufficient as most of these analytics utilize sort of bag-of-words counting algorithms. The majority of projects utilizing big data analytics have failed due to the obsession with metrics at the expense of capturing the customer's perspective data, as well as the failure in turning consumer insights into actions. Most of the consumer insights can be captured with qualitative research methods that work with small, even statistically insignificant, sample sizes. Employing qualitative analytics provide some kind of actionable intelligence which acquires understanding to broad questions about the consumer needs in tandem with analytical power. Generating insight, on one hand, requires sound techniques to measure consumers' engagement more precisely and offers depth analytics to the consumer data story. On the other hand, turning relevant insights into actions requires incorporating actionable intelligence across the business by verify hypotheses based on qualitative findings by using web analytics to see if these axioms apply to a large number of customers. The first component of our visionary approach is dedicated to identifying the relationships between constituents of the healthcare pain points as echoed by the social media conversation in terms of sociographic network where the elements composing these conversations are described as nodes and their interactions as links. In this part, conversation groups of nodes that are heavily connected will be identified representing what we call conversation communities. By identifying these conversation communities several consumer hidden insights can be inferred from using techniques such as visualizing conversation graphs relevant to given pain point, conversation learning from question answering, conversations summaries, conversation timelines, conversation anomalies and other conversation pattern learning techniques. These techniques will identify and learn the patient insights without forgetting from the context of conversation communities, are tagged as 'thick data analytics'. Additionally machine learning methods can be used as assistive techniques to learn from the identified thick data and build models around identified thick data. With the use of transfer learning we also can fine tune these models with the arrival of new conversations. The author is currently experimenting with these seven insights driven learning methods described in this paper with massive geo-located Twitter data to infer the quality of care related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. © 2013 IEEE.","graph based algorithms; graph-based machine learning; graph-based transfer learning; learning patient preferences; Neo4j; Patient insights; thick data; twitter conversation communities","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Health care; Social networking (online); Transfer learning; Call conversations; Consumer insights; Data driven decision; Data technologies; Healthcare institutions; Machine learning methods; Qualitative research methods; Question Answering; Learning systems",,"IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087793790

Moreover, an open waste bin is placed in each user’s cubicle to collect used toilet paper and tissues. Such practices, which are common in East Asia and central America, have induced a dilemma of toilet paper disposal because some municipalities have removed waste bins from public toilets to prevent virus transmission by fecal matter. As a consequence, users were forced to flush down their used toilet paper and tissues. Yet, it is unknown whether standard toilet paper can be flushed easily without causing issues in sewer operations. Here, we surveyed the conditions of toilets in university campus and other public facilities in different regions across China. We also evaluated the disintegration characteristics of toilet paper products both by conducting online surveys and by physical disintegration experiments. We found that only 15% of toilets provided toilet paper, while open waste bins occurred at nearly all sites. Further, our survey indicated that 82% of toilet paper products sold in China did not give any indication on their flushability, whereas 77% of US products did. Disintegration results showed that none of the five popular, best-selling toilet paper products passed the flushability standard.

Laboratory confirmation of lesions has impacts on trade restrictions for herds, therefore if laboratory capacity was diminished, how herds are treated would require an informed risk policy. Here we report the proportion of herds with subsequent evidence of within-herd transmission, based on skin-test results. We assess how herd-size, herd-type, and bTB-history affect the probability of additional reactors at follow-up test using univariable and multivariable random-effects models. The study represents a rapid response to developing an evidential base for policy demands during an extraordinary event, the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland. A dataset from 2005 to 2019 of breakdowns were collated. Overall, 20,116 breakdowns were initiated by LRS cases. During the index tests of these breakdowns, 3931 revealed ≥1 skin-test reactor animals (19.54%; ≥1 standard reactors: 3827; 19.02%). Increasing herd-size was associated with reactor disclosure on follow-up. For small herds (<33 animals), 11.74% of follow-up tests disclosed ≥1 reactor; 24.63% of follow-up tests from very large herds (>137) disclosed ≥1 reactors. Beef (13.87%) and “other” (13%) herd production types had lower proportion of index tests with reactors in comparison with dairy (28.27%) or suckler (20.48%) herds. Historic breakdown size during the previous 3-years was associated reactor disclosure risk on follow-up.

ST has been used in multiple disciplines to address interacting infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and mental health conditions. The theory has been critiqued for its inability to measure disease interactions and their individual and combined health outcomes. This article reviews literature that strongly suggests a syndemic between food insecurity (FI) and diet-related chronic diseases (DRCDs), and proposes a model to measure the extent of such interaction. The article seeks to: (1) examine the potential syndemic between FI and DRCDs; (2) illustrate how the incorporation of Life History Theory (LHT), into a syndemic framework can help to highlight critical lifeperiods when FI-DRCD interactions result in adverse health outcomes; (3) discuss the use of mixed methods to identify and measure syndemics to enhance the precision and predictive power of ST; and (4) propose an analytical model for the examination of the FI-DRCD syndemic through the life course. The proposed model is more relevant now given the significant increase in FI globally as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The differential impact that the pandemic appears to have among various age groups and by other demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, income) offers an opportunity to examine the potential FI-DRCD syndemic under the lens of LHT. © 2020","Diet-related chronic diseases; Food insecurity; Life history theory; Medical anthropology; Public health; Syndemics",,,"Soc.

The topics include a detailed description of epitope prediction tools for designing epitope-based vaccines and agent-based models for immune system response prediction, along with a focus on their potentiality to facilitate clinical trial phases. Expert opinion: Artificial intelligence and systems biology offer the opportunity to avoid the inefficiencies and failures that arise in the classical vaccine development pipeline. One promising solution is the combination of both methodologies in a multiscale perspective through an accurate pipeline. We are entering an ‘in silico era’ in which scientific partnerships, including a more and more increasing creation of an ‘ecosystem’ of collaboration and multidisciplinary approach, are relevant for addressing the long and risky road of vaccine discovery and development. In this context, regulatory guidance should be developed to qualify the in silico trials as evidence for intelligent vaccine development. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agent-based models; artificial intelligence; Covid-19; epitope prediction; immune system modeling; systems biology; Vaccine development","antigen; epitope; vaccine; artificial intelligence; computer model; drug design; human; immune system; knowledge discovery; nonhuman; pipeline; prediction; priority journal; Review; systems biology","32662677","Expert Opin.

A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. A cutoff score was identified from a receiver operator curve (ROC) that best identified individuals with significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The 10-item MISS-HP measures 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10–100). Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. PCA identified three factors, which was confirmed by CFA, explaining 56.8% of the variance. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by modest correlations (r’s = 0.25–0.37) with low religiosity, depression, and anxiety symptoms, whereas convergent validity was evident by strong correlations with clinician burnout (r = 0.57) and with another multi-item measure of MI symptoms (r = 0.65). ROC characteristics indicated that a score of 36 or higher was 84% sensitive and 93% specific for identifying MI symptoms causing moderate to extreme problems with family, social, and occupational functioning. The MISS-HP is a reliable and valid measure of moral injury symptoms in health professionals that can be used in clinical practice to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment, as well as when conducting research that evaluates interventions to treat MI in HPs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Burnout; Depression; Health professionals; Internal conflict; Moral injury; Religiosity",,,"J.

One of the approaches often employed towards preventing the entry and proliferation of viruses is computer-aided inhibition studies to identify potent compounds that can inhibit activity of viral targets in the host through binding at the active site. In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model of reportedly potent drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2). The model was used to screen the ZINC database for commercially available compounds having similar features with the experimentally tested drugs. The top 3000 compounds retrieved were docked into the active sites of a homology-modelled TMPRSS2. Docking scores of the top binders were validated and the top-ranked compounds were subjected to ADME, Lipinski’s and medicinal Chemistry property predictions for druglikeness analyses. Two lead compounds, ZINC64606047 and ZINC05296775, were identified having binding affinities higher than those of the reference inhibitors, favorable interactions with TMPRSS2 active site residues and good ADME and medicinal chemistry properties. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess the stability and dynamics of the interactions of these compounds with TMPRSS2. Binding free energy and contribution energy evaluations were determined using MMPBSA method. Analyses of the trajectory dynamics collectively established further that the lead compounds bound and interacted stably with active site residues of TMPRSS2. Nonetheless, experimental studies are needed to further assess the potentials of these compounds as possible therapeutics against coronaviruses. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The capacity of the virus to destroy the host cell by liberating its own DNA or RNA and replicating inside the host cell poses challenges in the development of antiviral therapeutics. In recent years, many new technologies have been explored for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections. Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising technologies on account of its ability to deal with viral diseases in an effective manner, addressing the limitations of traditional antiviral medicines. It has not only helped us to overcome problems related to solubility and toxicity of drugs, but also imparted unique properties to drugs, which in turn has increased their potency and selectivity toward viral cells against the host cells. The initial part of the paper focuses on some important proteins of influenza, Ebola, HIV, herpes, Zika, dengue, and corona virus and those of the host cells important for their entry and replication into the host cells. This is followed by different types of nanomaterials which have served as delivery vehicles for the antiviral drugs. It includes various lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid–polymer hybrid–based, carbon-based, inorganic metal–based, surface-modified, and stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials and their application in antiviral therapeutics. The authors also highlight newer promising treatment approaches like nanotraps, nanorobots, nanobubbles, nanofibers, nanodiamonds, nanovaccines, and mathematical modeling for the future. The paper has been updated with the recent developments in nanotechnology-based approaches in view of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.

The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals. © 2020 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","anthropogenic land-use change; deforestation; epidemic; global change; mammals; urbanisation; zoonotic diseases",,,"Mammal Rev.",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085747918

The specificities of four McAbs (1-1C2, 2-2E5, 1-1D6, and 2-8F11) were examined by Western blotting as well as indirect fluorescence assay. Twelve different recombinant truncated N proteins were then used to identify the epitopes recognized by the McAbs by Western blotting. The results showed that: (1) McAbs 1-1C2, 2-2E5, and 1-1D6 recognized neither human coronviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E nor their nucleocapsid proteins, implying a possible specificity of these 3 McAbs to SARS-CoV; (2) The epitopes recognized by McAbs 2-8F11, 2-2E5, and 1-1D6 were located between the 30th and 60th amino acid (a.a.) residues of the SARS-CoV N protein, while the epitopes recognized by the McAb1-1C2 were located between 170th and 184th a.a. residues. The identification of the specific epitopes of SARS-CoV N protein is paramount for the immunological characterization, the development of accurate immunological assay as well as for exploring the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.","Epitope; Monoclonal antibody; Nucleocapsid protein; SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)","amino acid; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody 1 1C2; monoclonal antibody 1 1D6; monoclonal antibody 2 2E5; monoclonal antibody 2 8F11; nucleocapsid protein; unclassified drug; antibody specificity; article; controlled study; epitope mapping; Escherichia coli; fluorescent antibody technique; immunoassay; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; protein analysis; protein expression; protein localization; SARS coronavirus; Western blotting; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Virol.

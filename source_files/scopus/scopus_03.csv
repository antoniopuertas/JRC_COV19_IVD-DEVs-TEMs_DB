In this regard, here we will review critically the current developed diagnostic tools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and compare the different types through the discussion of their pros and cons such as nucleic acid detection tests (including PCR and CRISPR), antibody and protein-based diagnosis tests. In addition, potential technologies that are under development such as on-site diagnosis platforms, lateral flow, and portable PCR units are discussed. Data collection and epidemiological analysis could also be an interesting factor to incorporate with the emerging technologies especially with the wide access to smartphones. Lastly, a SWOT analysis and perspectives on how the development of novel sensory platforms should be treated by the different decision-makers are analyzed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Diagnostic kits; Response strategies; SARS-CoV-2; Sensors/biosensors","Chemical detection; Decision making; Polymerase chain reaction; Data collection; Decision makers; Diagnostic testing; Diagnostic tools; Emerging technologies; Nucleic acid detection; On-site diagnosis; Potential technologies; Sensory analysis",,"Talanta",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089373920

In only few weeks it has caused a global pandemic, with mortality reaching 3.4%, mostly due to a severe pneumonia. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the central nervous system (CNS) and mental health outcomes remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of other types of coronaviruses in the brain, especially in the brainstem. There is evidence that the novel coronavirus can penetrate CNS through the olfactory or circulatory route as well as it can have an indirect impact on the brain by causing cytokine storm. There are also first reports of neurological signs in patients infected by the SARS-Cov-2. They show that COVID-19 patients have neurologic manifestations like acute cerebrovascular disease, conscious disturbance, taste and olfactory disturbances. In addition, there are studies showing that certain psychopathological symptoms might appear in infected patients, including those related to mood and psychotic disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Accumulating evidence also indicates that the pandemic might have a great impact on mental health from the global perspective, with medical workers being particularly vulnerable. In this article, we provide a review of studies investigating the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS and mental health outcomes. We describe neurobiology of the virus, highlighting the relevance to mental disorders. Furthermore, this article summarizes the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 from the public health perspective. Finally, we present a critical appraisal of evidence and indicate future directions for studies in this field. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,"32730915","Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. Biol.

The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, mechanisms underlying immune abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 must be elucidated to guide clinical management of the disease. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.

Human-to-human transmission of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs most often when people are in the incubation stage of the disease or are carriers and have no symptoms. Therefore, in this study, was discussed the role of environmental factors and conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed as well as food, water and sewage, air, insects, inanimate surfaces, and hands in COVID-19 transmission. The results of studies on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 on different levels showed that the resistance of this virus on smooth surfaces was higher than others. Temperature increase and sunlight can facilitate the destruction of SARS-COV-2 and the stability of it on surfaces. When the minimum ambient air temperature increases by 1 °C, the cumulative number of cases decreases by 0.86%. According to the latest evidence, the presence of coronavirus in the sewer has been confirmed, but there is no evidence that it is transmitted through sewage or contaminated drinking water. Also, SARS-COV-2 transmission through food, food packages, and food handlers has not been identified as a risk factor for the disease. According to the latest studies, the possibility of transmitting SARS-COV-2 bioaerosol through the air has been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmology. The results additionally show that infectious bio-aerosols can move up to 6 feet.

Seven coronaviruses that infect humans have been identified: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the most recently discovered. It has created a severe worldwide outbreak beginning in late 2019, leading to date to over 4 million cases globally. Viruses are genetically simple, yet highly diverse. However, the recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, indicate that there remains a long way to go to identify and develop specific therapeutic treatments. Only after gaining a better understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms can we minimize viral pandemics. This paper mainly focuses on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Here, recent studies are summarized and reviewed, with a focus on virus–host interactions, vaccine-based and drug-targeted therapies, and the development of new approaches for clinical diagnosis and treatment. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 6; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; RANTES; structural protein; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; abdominal pain; adult respiratory distress syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; fatigue; fever; human; immunoaffinity chromatography; lobar pneumonia; malaise; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality; myalgia; pandemic; pathogenesis; phylogenetic tree; respiratory failure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; RNA sequencing; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Staphylococcus aureus; vaccination; virus cell interaction; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; molecularly targeted therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; T-Lymphocytes","32533062","Signal Transduct.

Conventional sewage treatment methods with disinfection are expected to eradicate SARS-CoV-2. However, for densely populated countries like India with lower sewage treatment facilities, chances of contamination are extremely high; as SARS-CoVs can survive up to several days in untreated sewage; even for a much longer period in low-temperature regions. With around 1.8 billion people worldwide using faecal-contaminated source as drinking water, the risk of transmission of COVID-19 is expected to increase by several folds, if proper precautions are not being taken.

Therefore, based on the fast and global spread of the virus, urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop preventive and therapeutic drugs. In this regard, treatments addressing the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become a major focus. Notably, while a rapid and well-coordinated immune response represents the first line of defense against viral infection, excessive inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive host immune defense may lead to tissue damage both at the site of virus entry and at systemic level. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in COVID-19 patients. In particular, the massive cytokine and chemokine release, the so-called “cytokine storm”, clearly reflects a widespread uncontrolled dysregulation of the host immune defense. Although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling, a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identification of signaling pathways altered during viral infections may help to unravel the most relevant molecular cascades implicated in biological processes mediating viral infections and to unveil key molecular players that may be targeted. Thus, given the key role of the immune system in COVID-19, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the immune dysregulation might give us clues for the clinical management of the severe cases and for preventing the transition from mild to severe stages. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epidermal growth factor receptor; gamma interferon; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 23; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; myeloid differentiation factor 88; neutralizing antibody; nucleocapsid protein; pathogen associated molecular pattern; RANTES; ruxolitinib; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor; tocilizumab; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 7; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; toll like receptor; adaptive immunity; antiinflammatory activity; Burkholderia pseudomallei; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; cytokine storm; host pathogen interaction; human; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunopathology; innate immunity; JAK-STAT signaling; lung injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; Ruminococcus; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tissue injury; ubiquitination; virology; virus entry; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; intestine flora; molecularly targeted therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; virus pneumonia; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disease Progression; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; T-Lymphocytes; Toll-Like Receptors","32467561","Signal Transduct.

Previously, two critical biological parameters of the pathogen and the host–pathogen interaction—incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity—were proposed to account for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and to be useful in estimating the “certainty of success” of developing an effective vaccine for viral pathogens for which a vaccine currently does not exist. In considering the “certainty of success” in development of human coronavirus vaccines, particularly SARS-CoV-2, a third, related critical parameter is proposed—infectious inoculum intensity, at an individual-level, and force of infection, at a population-level. Reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) is predicted to lengthen the incubation period, which in turn is predicted to reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus. Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the “certainty of success” of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"coronavirus vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; coronavirus disease 2019; feasibility study; host pathogen interaction; human; incubation time; infectious inoculum intensity; inoculation; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity",,"npj Vaccines",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085471844

Besides lungs, salivary glands and tongue are possibly another hosts of 2019-nCoV due to expression of ACE2.

The major functions of HSPs include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides, protecting cells from toxic stress, and presenting immune and inflammatory cytokines. Regarded as a double-edged sword, HSPs also cooperate with numerous viruses and cancer cells to promote their survival. RNA chaperones are a group of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are essential factors for manipulating both the functions and metabolisms of pre-mRNAs/hnRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. hnRNPs involve in a large number of cellular processes, including chromatin remodelling, transcription regulation, RNP assembly and stabilization, RNA export, virus replication, histone-like nucleoid structuring, and even intracellular immunity. Dysregulation of stress proteins is associated with many human diseases including human cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s diseases, Alzheimer disease), stroke and infectious diseases. In this review, we summarized the biologic function of stress proteins, and current progress on their mechanisms related to virus reproduction and diseases caused by virus infections. As SPs also attract a great interest as potential antiviral targets (e.g., COVID-19), we also discuss the present progress and challenges in this area of HSP-based drug development, as well as with compounds already under clinical evaluation. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"2 amino 6 chloro 9 [(4 methoxy 3,5 dimethyl 2 pyridinyl)methyl]purine; 4 [[2 carbamoyl 5 (4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 6,6 dimethyl 4 oxo 3 (trifluoromethyl) 1h indazol 1 yl)phenyl]amino]cyclohexyl glycinate; ajferin A; alvespimycin; ansamycin derivative; antivirus agent; avrainvillamide; celastrol; dacinostat; deguelin; epigallocatechin gallate; epolactaene; ganetespib; geldanamycin; gold porphyrin; heat shock protein; heat shock protein 90 inhibitor; kongensin A; luminespib; mizoribine; myrtucommulone A; novobiocin; onalespib; platycodin D; retaspimycin; stephacidin B; sulforaphane; tanespimycin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vorinostat; antivirus agent; heat shock protein; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; RNA polymerase II; RNA precursor; apoptosis; biological activity; carcinogenesis; cellular immunity; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing; conformational transition; coronary artery disease; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release; degenerative disease; dengue; DNA replication; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Flavivirus infection; gene expression; gene knockdown; human; Human cytomegalovirus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Human T cell leukemia virus infection; influenza; Japanese encephalitis; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; papillomavirus infection; porcine epidemic diarrhea; protein degradation; protein misfolding; protein processing; retrovirus infection; Review; RNA interference; RNA splicing; RNA transport; signal transduction; transcription regulation; ubiquitination; virus assembly; virus infection; virus release; virus replication; Western blotting; Betacoronavirus; chromatin assembly and disassembly; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; procedures; severity of illness index; synthesis; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Coronavirus Infections; Gene Expression Regulation; Heat-Shock Proteins; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA Polymerase II; RNA Precursors; Severity of Illness Index; Signal Transduction; Transcription, Genetic; Virus Replication","32661235","Signal Transduct.

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; COVID-19; Environmental context; Modes of transmission; Solid waste; Wastewater-based epidemiology","Aerosols; Air quality; Decision making; Sewage; Solid wastes; Transmissions; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Air pollution impact; Atmospheric quality; Environmental contexts; Epidemiological studies; Indoor environment; Mitigation policies; Scientific community; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Diseases; COVID-19; detection method; disease prevalence; disease severity; disease spread; disease transmission; epidemic; pollution effect; respiratory disease; viral disease; wastewater; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; early diagnosis; environmental factor; fomite; human; infection control; medical decision making; pandemic; prevalence; priority journal; quantitative analysis; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; solid waste management; virus detection; virus transmission; virus virulence; waste water management; water analysis; water quality; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

Historically, it is the first cell line that was approved by the WHO for the production of human vaccines. Comprehensive experimental data on the production of many viruses using the Vero cell line can be found in the literature. However, the vast majority of these processes is relying on the microcarrier technology. While this system is established for the large-scale manufacturing of viral vaccine, it is still quite complex and labor intensive. Moreover, scale-up remains difficult and is limited by the surface area given by the carriers. To overcome these and other drawbacks and to establish more efficient manufacturing processes, it is a priority to further develop the Vero cell platform by applying novel bioprocess technologies. Especially in times like the current COVID-19 pandemic, advanced and scalable platform technologies could provide more efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet the global vaccine demand. Herein, we review the prevailing literature on Vero cell bioprocess development for the production of viral vectors and vaccines with the aim to assess the recent advances in bioprocess development.

This paper proposes a critical review of the state of the art regarding studies on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and sewage sludge, the factors affecting its inactivation and the main proposed treatments. In-vitro tests demonstrated low resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to high temperature, while even significant changes in pH would not seem to determine the disappearance of the virus. In real wastewater and in sewage sludge, to date studies on the influence of the different parameters on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 are not available. Therefore, studies involving other HCoVs such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E have been also considered, in order to formulate a hypothesis regarding its behaviour in sewage and throughout the steps of biological treatments in WWTPs. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater might track the epidemic trends: although being extremely promising, an effective and wide application of this approach requires a deeper knowledge of the amounts of viruses excreted through the faeces and the actual detectability of viral RNA in sewage. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Coronavirus removal; CoViD; Human health; SARS; Sewage sludge; Wastewater","Bioremediation; Sewage sludge; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Biological treatment; Critical review; High temperature; In-vitro tests; Low resistance; Real wastewater; SARS coronavirus; State of the art; Diseases",,"Process Saf.

In this review, we summarized the real-time information of 2019-nCoV treatment methods and mainly focused on the chemical drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and other potential innovative active molecules. Their potential targets, activity, clinical status and side effects are described. In addition, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) and biological reagents available, as well as the promising vaccine candidates against 2019-nCoV are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Chemical drugs; Coronavirus; Target protein; Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); Vaccines",,,"Eur.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, which cause diseases ranging from common colds to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are inhalation of aerosol/droplet and person-to-person contact, currently available evidence indicates that the viral RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological data and human health risks. Here, we review the current knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, and information relevant for human health risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of infected individuals but also in wastewater. One of the major challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and standardized protocol. Currently available data are also limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However, modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA); SARS-CoV-2; Virus detection method; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","Health risks; Risk assessment; RNA; Transmissions; Viruses; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Detection and quantifications; Gastrointestinal symptoms; Human health risk assessment; Model based approach; Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; World Health Organization; Diseases; virus RNA; COVID-19; disease transmission; epidemiology; health risk; public health; research work; respiratory disease; risk assessment; viral disease; wastewater; cell culture; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; epidemic; feces analysis; gastrointestinal symptom; health hazard; human; infection risk; nonhuman; occupational hazard; priority journal; respiratory virus; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survival factor; viral plaque assay; virus detection; virus shedding; virus transmission; waste water; water sampling; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus",,"Sci.

Therefore, the rapid identification of viruses should be one of the best ways to prevent an outbreak and important implications for medical healthcare. The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which belongs to the single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses. The pandemic dimension spread of COVID-19 poses a severe threat to the health and lives of seven billion people worldwide. There is a growing urgency worldwide to establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of COVID-19 to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Therefore, the need for sensitive, selective, and rapid diagnostic devices plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments and to prevent the epidemics. During the last decade, electrochemical biosensors have emerged as reliable analytical devices and represent a new promising tool for the detection of different pathogenic viruses. This review summarizes the state of the art of different virus detection with currently available electrochemical detection methods.

This disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus (CoV)-2. In the past, other members of the coronavirus family, such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have made an impact in China and the Arabian peninsula respectively. Both SARS and COVID-19 share similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing that can become fatal in later stages. However, SARS and MERS infections were epidemic diseases constrained to limited regions. By March 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 had spread across the globe and on March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, many patients succumbed to pneumonia. Higher rates of deaths were seen in older patients who had co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dementia. In this review paper, we discuss the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's-like dementia, and diabetes mellitus. We also focus on the virus genome, pathophysiology, theranostics, and autophagy mechanisms. We will assess the multiorgan failure reported in advanced stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, the binding affinity of the pangolin ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 RBD was later on reported to be low. Here, we provide evidence that the pangolin is not the intermediate animal at the origin of the human pandemic.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, frequency of sensory disorders (smell and/or taste) in affected patients has shown a high variability from 5 to 98%, depending on the methodology, country, and study. Recent Findings: A sudden, severe, isolated loss of smell and/or taste, in the absence of other upper airway inflammatory diseases (allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis), should alert individuals and physicians on being potentially affected by COVID-19. The evaluation of smell/taste disorders with a visual analogue scale or an individual olfactory or gustatory test, at the hospital or by telemedicine, to prevent contamination might facilitate an early detection of infected patients and reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Summary: During the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with sudden loss of smell should initiate social distancing and home isolation measures and be tested for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test when available. Olfactory training is recommended when smell does not come back after 1 month but can be started earlier. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acute rhinosinusitis; Anosmia; COVID-19; Hyposmia; SARS-CoV-2; Smell and taste dysfunction","corticosteroid; ageusia; allergic rhinitis; anosmia; chronic rhinosinusitis; coronavirus disease 2019; human; hyposmia; isolation; neuroepithelium; olfactometry; olfactory receptor; quality of life; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling; telemedicine; upper respiratory tract infection; virus transmission; visual analog scale","32748211","Curr.

Observations from this systematic review reveal the utility of RT-PCR with serological testing as one such method cannot correlate with accurate results. Availability of point of care devices do not conform to sensitivity and specificity in comparison to the conventional methods due to lack of clinical investigations. Pivotal aim of molecular and serological research is the development of detection methods that can support the clinical decision making of patients suspected with SARS-CoV-2. However, none of the methods were 100% sensitive and specific; hence additional studies are required to overcome the challenges addressed here.

The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic. Method: A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead. Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice.

The Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically searched. Articles reporting nephropathy, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), coronavirus and the renal injury were included for assessment. Study designs, contrast agents, case reports and results were assessed. Of the assessed studies, suggested mechanisms include sepsis which caused cytokine storm syndrome or perhaps direct cellular injury due to the virus. In patients who were studied, albuminuria, proteinuria, and hematuria as well as an elevation in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed. Additionally CT scan of the kidneys showed a decrease in tissue density suggestive of inflammation and interstitial edema. On the other hand, dialysis patients are a high-risk group than the general population. The current treatment for COVID-19 in acute kidney injury includes supportive management or kidney replacement therapy. All patients need to be quarantined. An N95 fit-tested mask and protective clothing and proper equipment are necessary.

Results: Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms.

However, some startling information is gathered in terms of reduced premature mortality cases associated with air and water quality improvement, enhanced e-learning on a broader platform, work from home, and successful e-health. The decline in vehicular density on roads and congestion leads to reduced energy consumption and associated greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants emission. The lockdown has also been identified as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes. Similarly, industrial pollution has been recognized as one of the primary causes of water resource pollution and would, therefore, bring change in policy vis-à-vis groundwater pollution control. Our findings suggest that the results of successful e-learning and work from home would be a permanent shift from conventional modes in the near future due to a drastic reduction in socio-economic cost. Our critical analysis also highlights that with such temporary lockdown measures acute/chronic ill-effects of anthropogenic perturbations on planet earth can be effectively estimated through sociocultural, socioeconomical and socio-political/sociotechnological nexus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Covid-19; e-learning; Earth overshoot day; Groundwater; Vehicular traffic",,,"Groundw.

The frequency of these outbreaks, their mortality and associated disruption to normal life calls for concerted efforts to understand their occurrence and fate in different environments. There is an increased interest in the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater from the perspective of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, there is no comprehensive review of the knowledge on coronavirus occurrence, fate and potential transmission in wastewater. This paper, provides a review of the literature on the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater treatment processes. We discuss the presence of viral RNA in feces as a result of diarrhoea caused by gastrointestinal infections. We also reviewed the literature on the presence, survival and potential removal of coronaviruses in common wastewater treatment processes. The detection of infectious viral particles in feces of patients raises questions on the potential risks of infection for people exposed to untreated sewage/wastewater. We, therefore, highlighted the potential risk of infection with coronaviruses for workers in wastewater treatment plants and the public that may be exposed through faulty plumbing or burst sewer networks. The mortalities and morbidities associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic warrants a much more focused research on the role of environments, such as wastewater and surface water, in disease transmission. The current wealth of knowledge on coronaviruses in wastewater based on the reviewed literature is scant and therefore calls for further studies. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Human coronavirus; Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS); Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); Sewage; Wastewater","Reclamation; Sewage; Sewage treatment plants; Surface waters; Disease transmission; Gastrointestinal infections; Potential transmissions; Untreated sewage; Viral particles; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment process; World Health Organization; Wastewater treatment; virus RNA; COVID-19; feces; health risk; literature review; occupational exposure; public health; RNA; viral disease; virus; wastewater treatment plant; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; environmental impact; feces; gastrointestinal infection; human; infection risk; Middle East respiratory syndrome; morbidity; nonhuman; occupational hazard; pandemic; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; sewage treatment; virus concentration; virus detection; virus load; virus morphology; virus particle; virus survival; virus transmission; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; World Health Organization; Coronavirus","32711332","Environ.

Nearly all emerging viruses, including Ebola, Dengue, Nipah, West Nile, Zika, and coronaviruses (including SARS-Cov2, the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic), have zoonotic origins, indicating that animal-to-human transmission constitutes a primary mode of acquisition of novel infectious diseases. Why these viruses can cause profound pathologies in humans, while natural reservoir hosts often show little evidence of disease is not completely understood. Differences in the host immune response, especially within the innate compartment, have been suggested to be involved in this divergence. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that play a critical role in the early antiviral response, secreting effector cytokines and clearing infected cells. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms through which NK cells interact with viruses, their contribution towards maintaining equilibrium between the virus and its natural host, and their role in disease progression in humans and other non-natural hosts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"Curr.

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations. © 2020","Covid-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; SARSCoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","Diagnosis; Food supply; Network security; Public health; Sewage; Chemical signatures; Clinical diagnostics; Diagnostic testing; Environmental scientists; Financial institution; Large-scale applications; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic treatments; Diseases; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; future prospect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; viral disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; human; international cooperation; mass screening; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Waste Water","32474280","Sci.

As the viral infection is driven by increased angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression, with the kidney exhibiting the highest expression, it is crucial to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: This study considers up-to-date information on the biological determinants shared by COVID-19 and renal disease, and aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of RCC patients with COVID-19. Evidence acquisition: A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science). As of March 31, 2020, the Center for Disease Control reported that of the adults hospitalized for COVID-19 with underlying conditions in the USA, 74.8% had chronic renal disease. Evidence synthesis: Evidence is discussed from epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and molecular studies on the role of kidney in facilitating routes for SARS-CoV-2 entry, leading to increased virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical manifestation of symptoms in RCC. Conclusions: This analysis will advance our understanding of (1) the molecular signatures shared by RCC and COVID-19 and (2) the clinical implications of overlapping signaling pathways in the therapeutic management of RCC and COVID-19 patients.

Although no case of SARS-CoV-2 contagion related to surgical smoke has been reported, several international surgical societies recommended caution or even discouraged the use of a laparoscopic approach. Objective: To evaluate the risk of virus spread due to surgical smoke during surgical procedures. Evidence acquisition: We searched PubMed and Scopus for eligible studies, including clinical and preclinical studies assessing the presence of any virus in the surgical smoke from any surgical procedure or experimental model. Evidence synthesis: We identified 24 studies. No study was found investigating SARS-CoV-2 or any other coronavirus. About other viruses, hepatitis B virus was identified in the surgical smoke collected during different laparoscopic surgeries (colorectal resections, gastrectomies, and hepatic wedge resections). Other clinical studies suggested a consistent risk of transmission for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the surgical treatments of HPV-related disease (mainly genital warts, laryngeal papillomas, or cutaneous lesions). Preclinical studies showed conflicting results, but HPV was shown to have a high risk of transmission. Conclusions: Although all the available data come from different viruses, considering that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown in blood and stools, the theoretical risk of virus diffusion through surgical smoke cannot be excluded. Specific clinical studies are needed to understand the effective presence of the virus in the surgical smoke of different surgical procedures and its concentration. Meanwhile, adoption of all the required protective strategies, including preoperative patient nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19, seems mandatory. Patient summary: In this systematic review, we looked at the risk of virus spread from surgical smoke exposure during surgery. Although no study was found investigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or any other coronavirus, we found that the theoretical risk of virus diffusion through surgical smoke cannot be excluded. © 2020 European Association of Urology","COVID-19; Minimally invasive surgery; smoke; Surgical; Virus",,"32527624","Eur.

The S protein is densely decorated with N-linked glycans protruding from the trimer surface that affect S protein folding, processing by host cell proteases and the elicitation of humoral immune response. Deep insight into the sophisticated structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein may provide a blueprint for vaccination strategies, as reviewed herein. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","ACE2; Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2; Immune response; Protein structure; Receptor binding domain; Spike protein; Vaccination; Viral fusion protein","adenovirus vector; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus S protein; DNA vaccine; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; monoclonal antibody; mRNA vaccine; proteinase; single chain fragment variable antibody; T lymphocyte receptor; unclassified drug; virus RNA; virus spike protein; virus vector; amino acid sequence; antigen recognition; CD4+ T lymphocyte; conformation; coronavirus disease 2019; host cell; human; humoral immunity; immune evasion; immune response; immunization; immunosurveillance; nonhuman; practice guideline; protein folding; protein processing; protein structure; Review; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus neutralization","32645344","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087704588

SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequence with the most studied SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly deadly pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Increasing evidence shows that these coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also neuroinvasive and neurotropic, with potential neuropathological consequences in vulnerable populations. The aim of this study is to predict a likely CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2 by studying the pathogenic mechanisms in common with other better known and studied coronaviruses with which it shares the same characteristics. Understanding the mechanisms of neuroinvasion and interaction of HCoV (including SARS-Cov-2) with the CNS is essential to evaluate potentially pathological short- and long-term consequences. Autopsies of the COVID-19 patients, detailed neurological investigation, and attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from the endothelium of cerebral microcirculation, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, and neuronal tissue can clarify the role played by COVID-19 in CNS-involvement and in the ongoing mortalities as has been in the recent outbreak. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brain; Central nervous system; Covid-19; Human coronavirus; Italy; Neuroscience; SARS-Cov-2",,,"J.

Incidence and severity of COVID-19 are higher in the elderly population (65 years and older). This may be due to higher frequency of comorbidities, but increased frailty and immunosenescence linked with aging may also contribute. Moreover, in elderly individuals, SARS-CoV-2 may adopt different molecular strategies to strongly impact on cardiac aging that culminate in exacerbating a pro-inflammatory state (cytokine storm activation), which, in turn, may lead to pulmonary vascular endothelialitis, microangiopathy, diffuse thrombosis, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. All these events are particularly relevant in elderly patients, and deserve targeted cardiovascular treatments and specific management of repurposed drugs against COVID-19. We discuss current evidence about the cardiovascular involvement during COVID-19, and elaborate on clinical implications in elderly patients. © 2020 The Authors","ACE2; Cardiovascular drugs; COVID-19; Cytokine release syndrome; Heart failure; Inflammation; Myocarditis; SARS-Cov 2; Troponin; Vasculitis",,,"Ann.

Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, Europe PubMed Central and EMBASE from 30 December 2019 to 12 May 2020. Results: We identified 113 studies conducted in 17 countries. The evidence from upper respiratory tract samples suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks around symptom onset or a few days thereafter, and becomes undetectable about two weeks after symptom onset; however, viral loads from sputum samples may be higher, peak later and persist for longer. There is evidence of prolonged virus detection in stool samples, with unclear clinical significance. No study was found that definitively measured the duration of infectivity; however, patients may not be infectious for the entire duration of virus detection, as the presence of viral ribonucleic acid may not represent transmissible live virus. Conclusion: There is a relatively consistent trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the course of COVID-19 from respiratory tract samples, however the duration of infectivity remains uncertain. © 2020","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infectivity; Review; RNA; SARS-CoV-2; Viral load",,"32615199","J.

The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae. From those, at least 7 coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans. Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms. Those that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of these viral jumps include SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 virus. They are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently discovered coronavirus disease during 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The rapid spread of the disease has taken the scientific and medical community by surprise. Latest figures from 20 May 2020 show more than 5 million people had been infected with the virus, causing more than 330,000 deaths in over 210 countries worldwide. The large amount of information received daily relating to COVID-19 is so abundant and dynamic that medical staff, health authorities, academics and the media are not able to keep up with this new pandemic.

Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Corona virus; Epidemics; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine","DNA vaccine; guanine nucleotide binding protein; inactivated virus vaccine; live vaccine; M protein; messenger RNA vaccine; Newcastle disease virus vector; nucleic acid vaccine; nucleotide; poxvirus vector; RBD protein; RNA vaccine; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; spike protein subunit; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus vector; adult respiratory distress syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; emergency care; high risk population; human; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; open reading frame; positive-strand RNA virus; public health service; Review; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; vaccine production; virus envelope; virus genome; virus infectivity; World Health Organization; zoonosis","32535078","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086377797

With the absence of specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the situation is very difficult to control. Apart from the absence of specific therapies, the lack of knowledge about potential therapeutic targets and individual perception is adding to the complications. The present review describes the novel SARS-CoV-2 structure, surface proteins, asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission in addition to the genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 along with genetic strains and similarity between SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic strategies such as inhibition of the endocytic pathway and suppressing RNA polymerase activity by metal ions, which could be quite beneficial for controlling COVID-19, are outlined. The drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2 is discussed in detail along with therapeutic classes such as antivirals, antibiotics, and amino quinolones and their probable role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 with reference to case studies. The ongoing clinical trials both with respect to drug repurposing and vaccines are summarized along with a brief description. The recent advancements and future perspective of ongoing research for therapy and detection of SARS-CoV-2 are provided.

The SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spectrum of non-specific signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets that infected people exhale during incubation and onset period. By 12 June 2020, over 7.5 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 421,000 deaths in the world have been reported to the WHO. No specific medication is approved to treat COVID-19, raising the urgent need for antiviral drug development. By 12 June 2020, there are over 1000 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov for treatment of COVID-19.

The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets.

This might lead to hindrance in acquiring realistic data of infectivity and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. This review summarizes the existing status of current diagnostic methods, their possible limitations, and the advantages of biosensor-based diagnostics over the conventional ones for the detection of SARS-Cov-2. Novel biosensors used to detect RNA-viruses include CRISPR-Cas9 based paper strip, nucleic-acid based, aptamer-based, antigen-Au/Ag nanoparticles-based electrochemical biosensor, optical biosensor, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. These could be effective tools for rapid, authentic, portable, and more promising diagnosis in the current pandemic that has affected the world economies and humanity.

Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th, 2020. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, T2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias. Results: 148 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12′149 patients (5′739 female) and a median age of 47.0 [35.0–64.6] years. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication. 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic. Older age (SMD: 1.25 [0.78–1.72]; p &lt; 0.001), being male (RR = 1.32 [1.13–1.54], p = 0.005) and pre-existing comorbidity (RR = 1.69 [1.48–1.94]; p &lt; 0.001) were identified as risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The heterogeneity between studies varied substantially (I2; range: 1.5–98.2%). Publication bias was only found in eight studies (Egger's test: p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our meta-analyses revealed important risk factors that are associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s)","Clinical characteristics; Comorbidities; COVID-19; Imaging features; Laboratory findings; Meta-analysis; Outcomes; SARS-CoV-2; Systematic review; Treatment",,"32763496","Travel Med.

The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed.

Methods: A total of 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in our study. For each patient we evaluated the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS), the Summated Xerostomia Inventory-Dutch Version (SXI-DV), The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED), Schirmer test I, the Hearing Handicap Inventory For Adults (HHIA) and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). All the tests we carried out were performed during the active phase of the symptomatology from COVID-19 (Condition A) and 15 after SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test negative (Condition B). Results: A total of 46 patients (92%) had olfactory dysfunction related to the infection. The 70% of patients reported gustatory disorders. Cough, fever, headache and asthenia were the most prevalent symptoms. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0,001) in sQOD-NS, SXI-DV, SPEED, Schirmer test, HHIA and THI between Condition A and Condition B. Conclusions: In our population there was an alteration of the sense of taste, of the sense of smell, dry eyes and of the oral cavity and an auditory discomfort, symptoms probably linked to the neurotropism of the virus. Furthermore, anosmia, dysgeusia and xerostomia are early symptoms of COVID-19, which can be exploited for an early quarantine and a limitation of viral contagion. © 2020","Anosmia; COVID-19; Dry eye; ENT; Head and neck; Hearing loss; Neurotropism; SARS-CoV-2","adult; aged; anosmia; asthenia; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dry eye; dysgeusia; dysphagia; dysphonia; dyspnea; face pain; female; fever; head and neck disease; headache; hearing handicap inventory for adults; hearing impairment; human; male; neurotropism; nose disease; nose obstruction; otalgia; postnasal drip; priority journal; prospective study; quarantine; questionnaire of olfactory disorders negative statements; Review; rhinorrhea; Schirmer test; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; standardized patient evaluation of eye dryness; summated xerostomia inventory dutch version; symptom assessment; symptomatology; taste disorder; tinnitus; tinnitus handicap inventory; xerostomia",,"Am.

ACE2 plays an important physiological role, practically in all the organs and systems. Also, ACE2 exerts protective functions in various models of pathologies with acute and chronic inflammation. While ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein leads to an overactivation of Angiotensin (Ang) II/AT1R axis and the deleterious effects of Ang II may explain the multiorgan dysfunction seen in patients.

Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is characterized by “inflamm-aging”. It is highly likely that “inflamm-aging” is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.

We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products. Source: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv. Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC. For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. Principal findings: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients. Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98) in patients with respiratory failure. Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively). Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence. Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion. Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density.

Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010–2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility. Chronic exposure to air pollutants might have a role in the spread of Covid-19 in Italian regions.

The symptoms vary from person to person and many are “hidden carriers.” Few people experience immediate reaction and even death within 48 h of infection. However, many show mild to chronic symptoms and recover. Nevertheless, the death rate due to COVID-19 transmission is high especially among patients with non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to consider vitamins as epigenetic modifiers to enhance immunity and reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients with non-communicable diseases. Recent Findings: Clinical evidence has suggested the risk of getting infected is high among individuals with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal disease, as well as the elderly with high mortality rate among the cohort. The impact is due to an already compromised immune system of patients. Every patient has a different response to COVID-19, which shows that the ability to combat the deadly virus varies individually. Thus, treatment can be personalized and adjusted to help protect and combat COVID-19 infections, especially in individuals with non-communicable diseases. Summary: Based on current published scientific and medical evidence, the suggestions made in this article for combination of vitamin therapy as epigenetic modifiers to control the unregulated inflammatory and cytokine marker expressions, further needs to be clinically proven. Future research and clinical trials can apply the suggestions given in this article to support metabolic activities in patients and enhance the immune response. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Immunotherapy; Non-communicable disease; Pandemic; Vitamin",,"32661859","Curr.

Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Neurodegeneration; Proteasome; Proteasome inhibitors; SARS-Cov-2","19s proteasome; 20s proteasome; aminophenazone; antineoplastic metal complex; bortezomib; carfilzomib; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; delanzomib; deubiquitinase; fatty acid; holoenzyme; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; ixazomib; natural product; oncoprotein; oprozomib; p21 activated kinase; porphyrin; proteasome; proteasome inhibitor; protein p27; protein p53; protein serine threonine kinase inhibitor; salinosporamide A; ubiquitin protein ligase; unclassified drug; biochemical analysis; biogenesis; cancer growth; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; clinical pharmacology; coronavirus disease 2019; degenerative disease; drug mechanism; drug repositioning; drug structure; drug targeting; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; enzyme regulation; enzyme structure; human; Huntington chorea; malignant neoplasm; metabolic regulation; neuropathology; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein assembly; protein homeostasis; regulatory mechanism; retina disease; Review","32442437","Pharmacol.

The neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of CoVs-induced CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. We consider that a widespread awareness of the significant neurotropism of CoVs might contribute to an earlier recognition of the signs and symptoms of viral-induced CNS damage. Moreover, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CoVs affect CNS function and cause CNS damage could help in planning new strategies for prognostic evaluation and targeted therapeutic intervention. © 2020","Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Neuroinflammation; SARS; Viral encephalitis","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; CXCL9 chemokine; emapalumab; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; sarilumab; serine proteinase; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; ageusia; anosmia; central nervous system disease; central nervous system function; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; headache; health care planning; heart failure; human; immune response; ischemia; kidney failure; lung insufficiency; molecular mechanics; mortality rate; nausea; neurobiology; neurotropism; nonhuman; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; prognosis; respiratory failure; Review; sensory dysfunction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus entry; virus virulence; vomiting; animal; Betacoronavirus; brain; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pathophysiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32622086","Neurobiol.

In this study, the fragmentation in MS–MS of small-molecule antiviral drugs against herpes and influenza viruses is reviewed. In this way, insight is gained on the identity of the product ions used in SRM. Fragmentation schemes of antiviral agents are also relevant in the identification of drug metabolites or (forced) degradation products. As information of the fragmentation of antiviral drugs in MS–MS and the identity of the product ions is very much scattered in the scientific literature, it was decided to collect this information and to review it.

In addition, some attention is paid to broad-spectrum antiviral agents, that are investigated with respect to their efficacy in challenging virus infections of this century, e.g., involving Ebola, Zika and corona viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, which is causing a world-wide pandemic at this very moment.

The importance of water as a parameter affecting virion stability and inactivation has been recognized across disciplinary areas. The large number of virus species, differences in spreading, likelihood of foodborne infections, unknown infective doses, and difficulties of infective virus quantification are often limiting experimental approaches to establish accurate data required for detailed understanding of virions’ stability and inactivation kinetics in various foods. Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions’ resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment.

While preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency, clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of COVID-19 infection. However, available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in term of dosing optimization. In this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing PK and PK-PD studies in this era of COVID. A special attention should be paid to pre-analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose-exposure relationships (co-medications, use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para-clinical data). We also promote the development of population PK and PK-PD models specifically dedicated to COVID-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases (SEL, malaria, HIV) and clinical situations (steady-state, non-ICU patients) are not representative of severe patients. Therefore, implementation of well-designed PK and PD studies targeted to COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. For that purpose we call for multi-institutional collaborative work and involvement of clinical pharmacologists in multidisciplinary research consortia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacokinetics; PK-PD","antivirus agent; analytical phase; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; dose response; drug exposure; human; multicenter study (topic); nonhuman; pharmacodynamic parameters; pharmacokinetic parameters; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); population model; practice guideline; pre-analytical phase; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review","32659293","Antiviral Res.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087793093

We estimated the adverse maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women and determined heterogeneity in the estimates and associated factors. Study Designs: PubMed search was performed of confirmed COVID-19 pregnant cases and related outcomes were ascertained prior to July 8, 2020, in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies reporting premature birth, low birth weight, COVID-19 infection in neonates, or mode of delivery status were included in the study. Two investigators independently performed searches, assessed quality of eligible studies as per the Cochrane handbook recommendations, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled proportions of maternal and neonatal outcomes were estimated using meta-analyses for studies with varying sample sizes while a systematic review with descriptive data analysis was performed for case report studies. Maternal and neonatal outcomes included C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, adverse pregnancy events and COVID transmission in neonates. Results: A total of 790 COVID-19 positive females and 548 neonates from 61 studies were analyzed. The rates of C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy events were estimated as 72 %, 23 %, 7 %, and 27 % respectively. In the heterogeneity analysis, the rate of C-section was substantially higher in Chinese studies (91 %) compared to the US (40 %) or European (38 %) studies. The rates of preterm birth and adverse pregnancy events were also lowest in the US studies (12 %, 15 %) compared to Chinese (17 %, 21 %), and European studies (19 %, 19 %). In case reports, the rates of C-section, preterm birth, and low birth weight were estimated as 69 %, 56 %, and 35 %, respectively. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were associated with infection acquired at early gestational ages, more symptomatic presentation, myalgia symptom at presentation, and use of oxygen support therapy. Conclusions: Adverse pregnancy outcomes were prevalent in COVID-19 infected females and varied by location, type, and size of the studies. Regular screening and early detection of COVID-19 in pregnant women may provide more favorable outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adverse pregnancy outcomes; Cesarean section; COVID-19; Low birth weight; Meta-analysis; Preterm birth",,,"Eur.

The pandemic puts health services, including cardiac surgery units, under escalating pressure. There are significant challenges caused by this novel virus and ensuing disease that leads to great uncertainty. While it has been advocated to delay elective surgeries, most cardiac surgical patients present in a more urgent manner which elevates the critical nature for intervention, which may make the surgical decision inevitable. To date, no definitive treatments to the pandemic have been promoted. Cardiac surgical centers may experience an increasing number of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice. Preparation for managing these patients will require a change in the current modalities for perioperative care. Therefore, the goal of this report is to share our own experiences, combined with a review of the emerging literature, by highlighting principles for the adult cardiac surgery community regarding treatment of patients scheduled for surgery.

Objective: To rapidly review literature and society guidelines and create expert consensus to provide guidance regarding management of outpatient gynecology scenarios via telemedicine. Search strategy: Searches were conducted in Medline and Cochrane databases from inception through April 15, 2020. Selection criteria: Literature searches were conducted for articles on telemedicine and abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, vaginitis, and postoperative care. Searches were restricted to available English language publications. Data collection and analysis: Expedited literature review methodology was followed and 10 943 citations were single-screened. Full-text articles and relevant guidelines were reviewed and narrative summaries developed. Main results: Fifty-one studies on the use of telemedicine in gynecology were found. Findings were reported for these studies and combined with society guidelines and expert consensus on four topics (abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis, vaginal discharge, and postoperative care). Conclusions: Guidance for treating gynecological conditions via telemedicine based on expedited literature review, review of society recommendations, and expert consensus is presented. Due to minimal evidence surrounding telemedicine and gynecology, a final consensus document is presented here that can be efficiently used in a clinical setting. © 2020 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics","COVID-19; Gynecology; Pandemic; Telehealth; Telemedicine",,,"Int.

Since elderly and frail people are at high risk, we wish to predict their vulnerability, and intervene if possible. For example, it would take little effort to take additional swabs or dried blood spots. Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic. Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection & inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment & vaccination response. Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity & mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis & osteoarthritis patients alike. Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells.

Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public. © 2020 The Author(s)",,"Drops; Shipbuilding; Air re-circulation; Airborne transmission; Building engineering; Contaminated surfaces; Engineering controls; Healthcare workers; Particle filtration; Relative contribution; Transmissions; air conditioning; airborne transmission; airborne virus; ambient air; cleaning; coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; epidemic; hand washing; human; infection control; isolation; Letter; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus transmission; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; crowding (area); devices; exposure; filtration; microbiology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Crowding; Disinfection; Filtration; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Ventilation","32521345","Environ.

Contrary to previous assumptions that GBCAs are stable throughout the water cycle, they can degrade. The stability of GBCAs depends largely on their organic ligands, but also on the physicochemical conditions. There is specific concern regarding UV end-of-pipe water treatments, which may degrade GBCAs. Degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects. This is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater. GBCAs concentrations in aquatic systems, often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium, are determined using a variety of calculation methods. Where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low, the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty. The current COVID-19 crisis will, in the short-term, drastically decrease the input of GBCAs to freshwater systems. Temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river-aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities.

Despite tremendous challenges, community-wide efforts have led to a variety of novel approaches for predicting drug polypharmacology. In particular, some rapid advances using machine learning and artificial intelligence have been reported with great success. Areas covered: In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive update on the current state-of-the-art polypharmacology approaches and their applications, focusing on those reports published after our 2017 review article. The authors particularly discuss some novel, groundbreaking concepts, and methods that have been developed recently and applied to drug polypharmacology studies. Expert opinion: Polypharmacology is evolving and novel concepts are being introduced to counter the current challenges in the field. However, major hurdles remain including incompleteness of high-quality experimental data, lack of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize multi-targeting agents, shortage of robust computational methods, and challenges to identify the best target combinations and design effective multi-targeting agents. Fortunately, numerous national/international efforts including multi-omics and artificial intelligence initiatives as well as most recent collaborations on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic have shown significant promise to propel the field of polypharmacology forward. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial Intelligence; deep Learning; Drug Polypharmacology; drug Repurposing; molecular Promiscuity; multi-omics; multi-targeting Design; network Pharmacology; off-targets",,"32452701","Expert Opin.

Since its first report in December 2019, COVID-19 cases have exploded to over 14 million as of July 2020, claiming more than 600,000 lives. Implementing fast and widespread diagnostic tests is paramount to contain COVID-19, given the current lack of an effective therapeutic or vaccine. This review focuses on a broad description of currently available diagnostic tests to detect either the virus (SARS-CoV-2) or virus-induced immune responses. We specifically explain the working mechanisms of these tests and compare their analytical performance. These analyses will assist in selecting most effective tests for a given application, for example, epidemiology or global pandemic research, population screening, hospital-based testing, home-based and point-of-care testing, and therapeutic trials. Finally, we lay out the shortcomings of certain tests and future needs. © 2020 The Author(s)Virology; Diagnostic Equipment; Infection Control in Health Technology; Analytical Chemistry © 2020 The Author(s)","Analytical Chemistry; Diagnostic Equipment; Infection Control in Health Technology; Virology",,,"iScience",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089141123

Development of a vaccine requires knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response and also features that might be pathogenic. Protective and pathogenic aspects of the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not well understood, partly because the virus has infected humans for only 6 months. However, insight into coronavirus immunity can be informed by previous studies of immune responses to non-human coronaviruses, common cold coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first time as a ‘Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis’, or ‘PANIC’ Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of abolishing ‘PANIC’; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to threaten it. © 2020 The Author(s)","ACE-2-r; Adaptive immunity; Alveoli; Complement; COVID-19; Cytokine; Gas exchange; Innate immunity; Methotrexate; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein","Betacoronavirus; biological model; Coronavirus infection; human; immunology; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Models, Immunological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32532449","J.

In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future.

With the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, it is highly possible that physicians and health care workers will not be able to treat all cases. Thus, computer scientists can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by introducing more intelligent solutions to achieve rapid control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes the disease. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this review were to analyze the current literature, discuss the applicability of reported ideas for using AI to prevent and control COVID-19, and build a comprehensive view of how current systems may be useful in particular areas. This may be of great help to many health care administrators, computer scientists, and policy makers worldwide. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of articles in the MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases to formulate a comprehensive review that summarizes different categories of the most recently reported AI-based approaches to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Our search identified the 10 most recent AI approaches that were suggested to provide the best solutions for maximizing safety and preventing the spread of COVID-19. These approaches included detection of suspected cases, large-scale screening, monitoring, interactions with experimental therapies, pneumonia screening, use of the IIoT for data and information gathering and integration, resource allocation, predictions, modeling and simulation, and robotics for medical quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: We found few or almost no studies regarding the use of AI to examine COVID-19 interactions with experimental therapies, the use of AI for resource allocation to COVID-19 patients, or the use of AI and the IIoT for COVID-19 data and information gathering/integration. Moreover, the adoption of other approaches, including use of AI for COVID-19 prediction, use of AI for COVID-19 modeling and simulation, and use of AI robotics for medical quarantine, should be further emphasized by researchers because these important approaches lack sufficient numbers of studies. Therefore, we recommend that computer scientists focus on these approaches, which are still not being adequately addressed. ©Aya Sedky Adly, Afnan Sedky Adly, Mahmoud Sedky Adly.

METHODS: A literature review was performed using searches in databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Thirty-two peer-reviewed papers and 23 preprints were examined. RESULTS: The studies included lateral flow immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence immunoassay, and neutralizing antibody assays. The use of all major SARS-CoV-2 antigens was demonstrated to have diagnostic value. Assays measuring total antibody reactivity had the highest sensitivity. In addition, all the methods provided opportunities to characterize the humoral immune response by isotype. The combined use of IgM and IgG detection resulted in a higher sensitivity than that observed when detecting either isotype alone. Although IgA was rarely studied, it was also demonstrated to be a sensitive marker of infection, and levels correlated with disease severity and neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONS: The use of serologic testing, in conjunction with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, was demonstrated to significantly increase the sensitivity of detection of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There was conflicting evidence regarding whether antibody titers correlated with clinical severity. However, preliminary investigations indicated some immunoassays may be a surrogate for the prediction of neutralizing antibody titers and the selection of recovered patients for convalescent serum donation. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

The antibodies targeted both S and N fragments and gave a high assay sensitivity by identifying 26 out of 26 COVID-19 patients with N antigen or with three protein fragments when combined into a single reaction. The assay correlated well with ELISA method and was specific to COVID-19 as we saw no reactivity among uninfected healthy controls.

However, each vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is important to evaluate multiple vaccine platforms to select the most efficient vaccine platform for SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian virus, has several well-suited properties for development of a vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

The potential involvement of COVID-19 in central nervous system (CNS) has attracted considerable attention due to neurological manifestations presented throughout the disease process. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to SARS-CoV, and both bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. Thus, cells expressing ACE2, such as neurons and glial cells may act as targets and are thus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we have reviewed the neurological characteristics of COVID-19 and summarized possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS. COVID-19 patients have presented with a number of different neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, hyposmia, and hypogeusia during the course of illness. It has also been reported recently that some cases of COVID-19 have presented with concurrent acute cerebrovascular disease (acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage), meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and acute Guillain–Barré syndrome. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in a cerebrospinal fluid specimen of a patient with COVID-19 have provided direct evidence to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. However, the underlying neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are yet to be established. SARS-CoV-2 may affect CNS through two direct mechanisms (hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde dissemination) or via indirect routes. The underlying mechanisms require further elucidation in the future. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ACE2; COVID-19; Neurotropic; SARS-CoV-2","virus RNA; acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cell invasion; cerebral sinus thrombosis; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; dizziness; encephalitis; evidence based practice; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; human; hypogeusia; hyposmia; meningitis; neurologic disease; neurologic examination; neurotropism; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; subarachnoid hemorrhage; systematic review (topic); animal; Betacoronavirus; blood brain barrier; brain; Coronavirus infection; dizziness; encephalitis; headache; metabolism; neurologic disease; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Dizziness; Encephalitis; Headache; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32458193","J.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to increase ACE2 expression in animal models, and worse outcomes are reported in patients with co-morbidities commonly treated with these agents, leading to controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic over whether these drugs might be helpful or harmful. Methods:: Animal, in vitro and clinical data relevant to the biology of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its interaction with the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and SARS-CoV-2, and clinical studies were reviewed. Findings and Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2to invade and damage cells, downregulating ACE2, reducing its protective effects and exacerbating injurious Ang II effects. However, retrospective observational studies do not show higher risk of infection with ACEI or ARB use. Nevertheless, study of the RAS and KKS in the setting of coronaviral infection may yield therapeutic targets. © 2020 The Author(s)","ACE inhibitors; ACE2; ARBs; COVID-19; Kallikrein-kinin system; Renin-angiotensin system; SARS-CoV-2",,,"EBioMedicine",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089100166

SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads by coughing, sneezing, droplet inhalation, and contact. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID-19. The participants in dental practice confront a particular risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to close contact with the patients and potential exposure to saliva-contaminated droplets and aerosols generated during dental procedures. In addition, saliva-contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross-infection. Hence, the control of saliva-related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID-19. Based on our experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva-related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain. In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread.

Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 319: C244–C249, 2020. First published June 9, 2020; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00187.2020.—The outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is posing a global health emergency and has led to more than 380,000 deaths worldwide. The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiviral, prosurvival, and antiaging effects. In light of the research advances on H2S signaling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defense against COVID-19. It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development. Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19. © 2020 the American Physiological Society","ACE2; COVID-19; H2S; SARS-CoV-2; TMPRSS2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydrogen sulfide; serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein, human; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; host pathogen interaction; human; lung; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydrogen Sulfide; Lung; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Serine Endopeptidases; Signal Transduction; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication","32515982","Am.

The aim of this review is to summarize available evidence providing an official position statement of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) Methods: A comprehensive Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library search was performed. Due to the limited evidence and the lack of studies, it was not possible to formulate recommendations according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria. Results: Several molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 can justify the presence of virus within the testis and possible alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function. Orchitis has been reported as a possible complication of SARS-CoV infection, but similar findings have not been reported for SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome. Finally, available data do not support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma seminal fluid of infected subjects. Conclusion: Data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological consultation and evaluation of gonadal function including semen analysis should be suggested. Studies in larger cohorts of currently infected subjects are warranted to confirm (or exclude) the presence of risks for male gametes that are destined either for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen or for assisted reproduction techniques. © 2020, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","COVID-19; Male fertility; SARS-CoV-2; Semen cryopreservation","blood clotting disorder; coronavirus disease 2019; cryopreservation; disease association; endocrine function; evidence based practice; gonad; human; male; male fertility; molecular biology; nonhuman; orchitis; Review; semen analysis; seminal plasma; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sperm preservation; spermatogenesis; testis; vascularization; vasculitis; virus identification; virus pathogenesis; andrology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cryopreservation; fertility preservation; Italy; medical society; pandemic; physiology; sexual health; spermatozoon; virus pneumonia; Andrology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cryopreservation; Fertility Preservation; Humans; Italy; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Semen Analysis; Sexual Health; Societies, Medical; Spermatozoa","32462316","J.

The food supply chain and the food industry do not comprise an exception. Scope and approach: This review summarizes the possible transmission ways of COVID-19 through the foods, food supply chain, surfaces, and environment before exploring the development of corresponding detection tools of SARS-CoV-2. For the time being, the possibility of transmission through the food sector is considered negligible, and tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in working environments is not considered as a priority by public authorities. However, the adverse effects on the environment, food systems, and people along the food supply chain are already evident. Key findings and conclusions: As long as we move from farm to fork, more safety measures are needed since more people (and subsequently more potential sources of infection) are involved in the process.

Since December 2019, when the virus was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially and extrarespiratory symptoms including neurologic symptoms are increasingly highlighted. Methods: Given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurologic involvements of SARS-Cov-2, we thought that providing an update for neurologic complications of COVID-19 would be useful for physicians and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery. Indeed, in this review we discuss several neurologic aspects reported in the literature to date including the evidence and pathways of neuroinvasion in COVID-19 and the main neurologic disorders reported in the literature to date, as well as future perspectives and the potential long-term consequence of current neuroinfection in COVID-19 patients. Results: Currently, there is convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, can affect the nervous system, with damage and neurologic alterations. These neurologic disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from nonspecific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurologic symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factors and are associated with poor outcome. However, most COVID-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurologic symptoms. Conclusions: Management of COVID-19 patients should include early clinical, radiologic, and laboratory neurologic assessment, with a close follow-up, especially in severe forms. Future studies should assess late and long-term consequences of current COVID-19 patients with neurologic involvement. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Long-term consequence; Nervous system; Pathophysiology; SARS-Cov-2","brain circulation; brain hemorrhage; brain hypoxia; brain infection; brain ischemia; consciousness disorder; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; encephalitis; epilepsy; follow up; genome analysis; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; human; hyposmia; laboratory test; long term care; myalgia; neurological complication; paralysis; pathophysiology; polyneuropathy; population; Review; risk factor; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","32474093","World Neurosurg.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086117481

The diagnosis of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critically dependent on the detection of SARSCoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs). While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with the EUA classification, and thus, assay verification can be daunting. Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with the supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: ‘COVID-19’, ‘2019-nCoV’, ‘coronavirus’ and ‘SARS-CoV-2’. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality. © 2020 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine","COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnosis; COVID-19 management; COVID-19 treatment; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","antivirus agent; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; immunostimulating agent; monoclonal antibody; cell therapy; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease course; human; laboratory test; mesenchymal stroma cell; meta analysis; oxygen therapy; priority journal; prognosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory care; respiratory distress; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus transmission; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; laboratory technique; lung; pandemic; patient isolation; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Lung; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Therapy","32348588","J.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. The virus and host factors interplay among distinct outcomes of infected patients. Methods: Using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) in PubMed, authors searched for articles cotaining information on COVID-19 and the skin. Results: The pathophysiology of the disease is multifactorial: association with innate immune response, hypercoagulability state, lung tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, monocytic/macrophage activation syndrome, culminating in exaggerated cytokine secretion, called “cytokine storm”, which leads to worsening and death. These systemic conditions may be associated with cutaneous lesions, that have polymorphic aspects, where at histopathological level show involvement in different skin changes. These lesions may be associated with multisystemic manifestations that could occur due to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease action, allowing the pulmonary infection and possibly skin manifestation. Several reports in literature show cutaneous lesions similar to chilblain, urticarial eruptions, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicle trunk, purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE) and others.

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; Diet; Dysbiosis; Gut microbiome; Immunity; Lung microbiota; SARS-CoV-2","virus RNA; coronavirus disease 2019; diet; disease association; environmental factor; genetics; human; immunity; intestine cell; intestine epithelium cell; intestine flora; lung; lung disease; nonhuman; nutrition; personalized nutrition; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; small intestine; aging; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; dysbiosis; gastrointestinal tract; homeostasis; immunology; microbiology; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Aging; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Dysbiosis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Homeostasis; Humans; Immunity; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32405119","Virus Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084475335

Although development of novel vaccines can prevent the SARS CoV-2 infections, it is still impeded by several other factors and therefore novel approaches towards treatment and management of this disease is the urgent need. Passive immunotherapy plays a vital role as a possible alternative to meet this challenge and among various antibody sources, chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies which have been previously studied against SARS CoV outbreak in China. In this review, we discuss the strategies for the use of chicken egg yolk (IgY) antibodies in the development of rapid diagnosis and immunotherapy against SARS CoV-2. Also, IgY antibodies have previously been used against various respiratory bacterial and viral infections in humans and animals. Compared to mammalian antibodies (IgG), chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) have greater binding affinity to specific antigens, ease of extraction and lower production costs, hence possessing remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity of pathogens in respiratory and lungs. We provide an overall importance for the use of monoclonal chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) using phage display method describing their potential passive immunotherapeutic application for the treatment and prevention of SARS CoV-2 infection which is simple, fast and safe way of approach for treating patients effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","IgY; Passive immunotherapy; Phage display; SARS CoV-2; Spike protein (S)","coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin Y; monoclonal antibody; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin Y; monoclonal antibody; single chain fragment variable antibody; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; virus RNA; antibody production; antiviral therapy; China; coronavirus disease 2019; global health; human; large scale production; passive immunization; phage display; priority journal; protein structure; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus neutralization; animal; antibody affinity; antibody specificity; Betacoronavirus; cell surface display; chemistry; chicken; Coronavirus infection; egg yolk; forecasting; genetics; immunology; laboratory technique; mammal; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; species difference; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Viral; Antibody Affinity; Antibody Specificity; Betacoronavirus; Cell Surface Display Techniques; Chickens; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Egg Yolk; Forecasting; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunoglobulins; Mammals; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Single-Chain Antibodies; Species Specificity; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","32512271","Int.

Data from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza suggest that pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection-associated morbidity and mortality. Physiologic changes in normal pregnancy and metabolic and vascular changes in high-risk pregnancies may affect the pathogenesis or exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin-(1-7) (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at elevated risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering angiotensin-(1-7) levels, which can mimic/worsen the vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia. Indeed, early reports suggest that, among other adverse outcomes, preeclampsia may be more common in pregnant women with COVID-19. Medical therapy, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, relies on medications with proven safety, but safety data are often missing for medications in the early stages of clinical trials.

The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being “immune” to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","ACE2; allergic rhinitis; asthma; COVID-19; receptor-binding domain; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TMPRSS2","alpha2b interferon; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; beta interferon; camostat; camostat mesilate; chloroquine; ciclesonide; favipiravir; formoterol; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; proteinase; recombinant enzyme; recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; umifenovir; unclassified drug; virus spike protein; aerosol; airway cell; allergic rhinitis; asthma; asymptomatic infection; clinical feature; conjunctiva disease; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytokine storm; diagnostic test; disease severity; drug repositioning; dyspnea; endocytosis; fever; headache; human; immune response; immunologist; lung alveolus cell; molecular epidemiology; myalgia; nonhuman; nose obstruction; nose secretion; pandemic; pathogenesis; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; protein protein interaction; quarantine; randomized controlled trial (topic); receptor binding; respiratory virus; Review; rhinorrhea; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sneezing; social distance; symptomatology; systematic review; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus genome; virus inhibition; virus load; virus transcription; virus transmission","32624257","J.

Theoretically, asthmatic patients should have increased susceptibility and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a deficient antiviral immune response and the tendency for exacerbation elicited by common respiratory viruses. However, existing studies have not shown an expected prevalence of asthmatic individuals among COVID-19 patients. Certain aspects of type 2 immune response, including type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, etc.) and accumulation of eosinophils, might provide potential protective effects against COVID-19. Furthermore, conventional therapeutics for asthma, including inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, might also reduce the risks of asthmatics suffering infection of the virus through alleviating inflammation or enhancing antiviral defense.

The absence of FDA oversight of serologic tests is concerning given that the commercially available serologic assays are highly variable, differing in their format, the antibody class detected, the targeted antigen, and the acceptable specimen types. An added complication is the lack of a clear understanding for how such assays should be utilized and what the reported results ultimately indicate or, perhaps more importantly, what they do not indicate. Here, we provide a brief summary of the performance of a number of serologic assays reported in the literature, comment on what we do and do not know regarding our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and provide a number of scenarios for which serologic testing will play a role during our global response to this pandemic. © 2020 Theel et al.

Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure.

Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of IL-6. There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still’s disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity.

The response by the Alberta Precision Laboratories, Public Health Laboratory (ProvLab), AB, Canada, included the development and implementation of nucleic acid detection-based assays and dynamic changes in testing protocols for the identification of cases as the epidemic curve increased exponentially. This rapid response was essential to slow down and contain transmission and provide valuable time to the local health authorities to prepare appropriate response strategies. As of May 24, 2020, 236,077 specimens were tested, with 6,475 (2.74%) positives detected in the province of Alberta, Canada. Several commercial assays are now available; however, the response from commercial vendors to develop and market validated tests is a time-consuming process. In addition, the massive global demand made it difficult to secure a reliable commercial supply of testing kits and reagents. A public health laboratory serves a unique and important role in the delivery of health care. One of its functions is to anticipate and prepare for novel emerging pathogens with a plan for pandemic preparedness. Here, we outline the response that involved the development and deployment of testing methodologies that evolved as SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide, the challenges encountered, and mitigation strategies.

In this commentary, we identify challenges and opportunities at human–primate interfaces in light of COVID-19, focusing on examples from Asia, and make recommendations for researchers working with wild primates to reduce zoonosis risk and leverage research opportunities. First, we briefly review the evidence for zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss risks of zoonosis at the human–primate interface. We then identify challenges that the pandemic has caused for primates, including reduced nutrition, increased intraspecific competition, and increased poaching risk, as well as challenges facing primatologists, including lost research opportunities. Subsequently, we highlight opportunities arising from pandemic-related lockdowns and public health messaging, including opportunities to reduce the intensity of problematic human–primate interfaces, opportunities to reduce the risk of zoonosis between humans and primates, opportunities to reduce legal and illegal trade in primates, new opportunities for research on human–primate interfaces, and opportunities for community education. Finally, we recommend specific actions that primatologists should take to reduce contact and aggression between humans and primates, to reduce demand for primates as pets, to reduce risks of zoonosis in the context of field research, and to improve understanding of human–primate interfaces. Reducing the risk of zoonosis and promoting the well-being of humans and primates at our interfaces will require substantial changes from “business as usual.” We encourage primatologists to help lead the way. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","biosafety; ethics; human–primate conflict; provisioning; SARS-CoV-2; zoonosis","Primates; SARS coronavirus; animal; Coronavirus infection; environmental protection; feeding behavior; human; pandemic; physiology; primate; primate disease; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coronavirus Infections; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Primate Diseases; Primates; Risk Factors; Zoonoses","32686188","Am.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies quickly published guidelines recommending avoiding laparoscopy or to consider open surgery because of the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surgical smoke or aerosol. This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy. Methods: A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications. Results: Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50. Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy. SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol. Conclusion: If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. Evidence-based research in this field is needed for definitive determination of safety. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Laparoscopy; Risk; Safety; SARS-CoV-2; Viral transmission","abdominoplasty; coronavirus disease 2019; electrosurgery; Embase; energy resource; human; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; Medline; pneumoperitoneum; practice guideline; priority journal; prospective study; Review; search engine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surgical smoke; systematic review; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; cauterization; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; infection control; laparoscopy; laparotomy; operating room; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; risk; smoke; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cautery; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Laparoscopy; Laparotomy; Operating Rooms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk; Smoke","32458289","Surg.

Later on, in 2012, the Middle‐East respiratory syndrome spread in Saudi Arabia, caused by MERS‐CoV. Currently, the global crisis is caused by the pandemic SARS‐ CoV‐2, which belongs to the same lineage of SARS‐CoV. In response to the urgent need of diagnostic tools, several lab‐based and biosensing techniques have been proposed so far. Five main areas have been individuated and discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The cell‐culture detection and the microneutralization tests are still considered highly reliable methods. The genetic screening, featuring the well‐established Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), represents the gold standard for virus detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. On the other side, immunoassays were developed, either by screening/antigen recognition of IgM/IgG or by detecting the whole virus, in blood and sera. Next, proteomic mass‐spectrometry (MS)‐based methodologies have also been proposed for the analysis of swab samples. Finally, virus-biosensing devices were efficiently designed. Both electrochemical immunosensors and eye‐based technologies have been described, showing detection times lower than 10 min after swab introduction. Alternative to swab‐based techniques, lateral flow point‐of‐care immunoassays are already commercially available for the analysis of blood samples. Such biosensing devices hold the advantage of being portable for on‐site testing in hospitals, airports, and hotspots, virtually without any sample treatment or complicated lab precautions. © 2020 by the authors.

Similarly, there is the possibility of controlling the COVID-19 infection by nucleotide analogues. Here we also highlight drugs ACEIs/ARBs inhibitory discussing both their advantages and disadvantages. The class of compounds/antibodies inhibiting interleukin-6 works in antirheumatoid drugs are found useful in alleviating overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs of the patient. These inclusion based approaches counter some of the side-effects associated with the heterocycles and also potentiate the efficacy of the molecules.

Objective: To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. Observations: Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. Implications: In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection.

This has led to massive global economic disruption, placed additional strain on local and global public health resources and, above all, threatened human health. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, written in English, reporting on the current COVID-19 pandemic. This data includes previously used strategies against infectious disease, recent clinical trials and FDA-approved diagnostic and treatment strategies. The literature was obtained through a systematic search using PubMed, Web of Sciences, and FDA, NIH and WHO websites. Of the 98 references included in the review, the majority focused on pathogen and host targeting, symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma utilization. Other sources investigated vaccinations in the pipeline for the possible prevention of COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate various conventional as well as potentially advanced in vitro diagnostic approaches (IVD) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Mixed results have been observed so far when utilising these approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Some treatments have been found highly effective in specific regions of the world while others have not altered the disease process. The responsiveness of currently available options is not conclusive. The novelty of this disease, the rapidity of its global outbreak and the unavailability of vaccines have contributed to the global public’s fear. It is concluded that the exploration of a range of diagnostic and treatment strategies for the management of COVID-19 is the need of the hour. © 2020, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","COVID-19; diagnosis; pandemic; public health; SARS-CoV-2; treatment strategies","alpha interferon; antibiotic agent; anticoagulant agent; antimalarial agent; antiparasitic agent; antivirus agent; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin; monoclonal antibody; vaccine; antivirus agent; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antibody detection; chemiluminescence immunoassay; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat nucleic acid analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; human; immunization; immunoglobulin blood level; in vitro study; infection; infection prevention; isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay; natural killer cell; nucleic acid amplification; nucleic acid analysis; palliative therapy; pandemic; pneumonia; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral nucleic acid detection; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; passive immunization; procedures; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","32748244","AAPS PharmSciTech",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088948344

The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and possible neuro-invasive mechanisms of Sars-CoV-2. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and COVID-dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID-19 terminology and neurology terminology up to 10 May 2020. Social media channels were followed up between 15 March and 10 May 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified papers and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. Results: Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID-19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and autoimmune disorders such as the Guillain–Barré syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID-19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. Conclusion: Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. No antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention are available and the long-term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain especially with regard to the neurological system. © 2020 European Academy of Neurology","cerebrovascular diseases; COVID-19; neuro-invasive mechanism; neurological manifestations; SARS-CoV-2","anosmia; autoimmune disease; autoimmunity; case study; central nervous system infection; cerebrovascular disease; consciousness disorder; coronavirus disease 2019; cranial nerve; degenerative disease; deterioration; epilepsy; extrapyramidal symptom; Guillain Barre syndrome; gustatory system; human; hyposmia; inflammation; nervous system inflammation; neurologic disease; neurological complication; nonhuman; nose disease; olfactory nerve disease; priority journal; Review; risk factor; seizure; sensory dysfunction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal; complication; Coronavirus infection; nervous system; neurologic disease; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32416028","Eur.

The most common molecular tests approved by regulatory bodies across the world for COVID-19 diagnosis are based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). While PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, specific, and remarkably reliable, they have many limitations ranging from the requirement of sophisticated laboratories, need of skilled personnel, use of complex protocol, long wait times for results, and an overall high cost per test. These limitations have inspired researchers to search for alternative diagnostic methods that are fast, economical, and executable in low-resource laboratory settings. The discovery of Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) has provided a reliable substitute platform for the accurate detection of low copy number nucleic acids in the diagnosis of several viral diseases, including epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). At present, a cocktail of LAMP assay reagents along with reverse transcriptase enzyme (Reverse Transcription LAMP, RT-LAMP) can be a robust solution for the rapid and cost-effective diagnosis for COVID-19, particularly in developing, and low-income countries. In summary, the development of RT-LAMP based diagnostic tools in a paper/strip format or the integration of this method into a microfluidic platform such as a Lab-on-a-chip may revolutionize the concept of PoCT for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review discusses the principle, technology and past research underpinning the success for using this method for diagnosing MERS and SARS, in addition to ongoing research, and the prominent prospect of RT-LAMP in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020 by the authors.

We review different biomarkers to evaluate if they are able to predict clinical outcomes and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify relevant articles using six different databases. Keywords to refine the search included ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV2’, ‘Biomarkers’, among others. Only studies which reported data on pre-defined outcomes were included. Key findings: Thirty-four relevant articles were identified which reviewed the following biomarkers: C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, cardiac troponin, renal biomarkers, lymphocytes and platelet count. Of these, all but two, showed significantly higher levels in patients with severe complications of COVID-19 infection compared to their non-severe counterparts. Lymphocytes and platelet count showed significantly lower levels in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Significance: Although research is still in its early stages, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave during the course of the disease could help clinicians in identifying severe disease earlier and subsequently improve prognosis. Nevertheless, we urge for more research across the globe to corroborate these findings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biomarkers; Blood tests; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","amyloid A protein; biological marker; C reactive protein; D dimer; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; troponin I; biological marker; C reactive protein; fibrin degradation product; fibrin fragment D; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; serum amyloid A; troponin I; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; disease severity; enzyme blood level; human; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; platelet count; prediction; prognosis; protein blood level; protein function; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; blood; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytology; kidney; laboratory technique; neutrophil; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Humans; Interleukin-6; Kidney; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lymphocyte Count; Neutrophils; Pandemics; Platelet Count; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Serum Amyloid A Protein; Troponin I","32405093","Life Sci.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084833512

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19. Methods: The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and April 6th 2020. No language restrictions were applied. Inclusion criteria were (a) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (b) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (c) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, or radiological examinations. Results: A total of 38 studies (1124 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1117 had their severity classified: 14.2% were asymptomatic, 36.3% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.1% were severe, and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (47.5%), followed by cough (41.5%), nasal symptoms (11.2%), diarrhea (8.1%), and nausea/vomiting (7.1%). One hundred forty-five (36.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (10.9%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count was reported in 12.9% of cases. Abnormalities in computed tomography were reported in 63.0% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows, and consolidations. Only one death was reported. Conclusions: Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adult cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","children; coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","asymptomatic infection; childhood; clinical feature; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; disease severity; fever; human; lymphocyte count; mortality; nausea; nose disease; pneumonia; priority journal; Review; systematic review; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diagnostic imaging; erythema; female; fever; infant; laboratory technique; male; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; prognosis; respiratory tract infection; tachycardia; tachypnea; virus pneumonia; vomiting; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Erythema; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Respiratory Tract Infections; Tachycardia; Tachypnea; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Vomiting","32492251","Pediatr.

Medical staff are at high risk of viral contamination and it is imperative to know what personal protective equipment (PPE) is appropriate for each situation. Furthermore, elective clinics and operations have been reduced in order to mobilize manpower to the acute specialties combating the outbreak; appropriate differentiation between patients who require immediate care and those who can receive telephone consultation or whose treatment might viably be postponed is therefore crucial. Italy was 1 of the earliest and hardest-hit European countries and therefore the Italian Skull Base Society board has promulgated specific recommendations based on consensus best practices and the literature, where available. Only urgent surgical operations are recommended and all patients should be tested at least twice (on days 4 and 2 prior to surgery). For positive patients, procedures should be postponed until after swab test negativization. If the procedure is vital to the survival of the patient, filtering facepiece 3 (FFP3) and/or powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) devices, goggles, full-face visor, double gloves, water-resistant gowns, and protective caps are mandatory. For negative patients, use of at least an FFP2 mask is recommended. In all cases the use of drills, which promote the aerosolization of potentially infected mucous particles, should be avoided. Given the potential neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, dura handling should be minimized.

The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients’ entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed. COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.

Since the first detection in China, it has spread rapidly worldwide. The increased burden has substantially affected neurosurgical practice and intensive modifications have been required in surgical scheduling, inpatient and outpatient clinics, management of emergency cases, and even in academic activities. In some systems, nonoverlapping teams have been created to minimize transmission among health care workers. In cases of a massive burden, neurosurgeons may need to be reassigned to COVID-19 wards, or teams from other regions may need to be sent to severely affected areas. Recommendations are as following. In outpatient practice, if possible, appointments should be undertaken via telemedicine. All staff assigned to the non-COVID treatment unit should be clothed in level 1 personal protective equipment. If possible, postponement is recommended for operations that do not require urgent or emergent intervention. All patients indicated for surgery must receive COVID-19 screening, including a nasopharyngeal swab and thorax computed tomography. Level 2 protection measures are appropriate during COVID-19–negative patients' operations. Operations of COVID-19–positive patients and emergency operations, in which screening cannot be obtained, should be performed after level 3 protective measures. During surgery, the use of high-speed drills and electrocautery should be reduced to minimize aerosol production. Screening is crucial in all patients because the surgical outcome is highly mortal in patients with COVID-19.

International guidance suggests direct droplet transmission is likely and airborne transmission occurs only with aerosol-generating procedures. Recommendations determining infection control measures to ensure healthcare worker safety follow these presumptions. Three mechanisms have been described for the production of smaller sized respiratory particles (‘aerosols’) that, if inhaled, can deposit in the distal airways. These include: laryngeal activity such as talking and coughing; high velocity gas flow; and cyclical opening and closure of terminal airways. Sneezing and coughing are effective aerosol generators, but all forms of expiration produce particles across a range of sizes. The 5-μm diameter threshold used to differentiate droplet from airborne is an over-simplification of multiple complex, poorly understood biological and physical variables. The evidence defining aerosol-generating procedures comes largely from low-quality case and cohort studies where the exact mode of transmission is unknown as aerosol production was never quantified. We propose that transmission is associated with time in proximity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, rather than the procedures per se. There is no proven relation between any aerosol-generating procedure with airborne viral content with the exception of bronchoscopy and suctioning. The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 transmission is unknown but the evidence suggestive of airborne spread is growing. We speculate that infected patients who cough, have high work of breathing, increased closing capacity and altered respiratory tract lining fluid will be significant producers of pathogenic aerosols. We suggest several aerosol-generating procedures may in fact result in less pathogen aerosolisation than a dyspnoeic and coughing patient. Healthcare workers should appraise the current evidence regarding transmission and apply this to the local infection prevalence. Measures to mitigate airborne transmission should be employed at times of risk. However, the mechanisms and risk factors for transmission are largely unconfirmed. Whilst awaiting robust evidence, a precautionary approach should be considered to assure healthcare worker safety. © 2020 Association of Anaesthetists","aerosol; airborne; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; transmission","aerosol; airborne particle; airborne virus; bronchoscopy; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; exhalation; health care personnel; human; nebulization; nonhuman; particle size; positive end expiratory pressure; resuscitation; Review; risk factor; shear stress; virus particle; virus transmission; work of breathing; World Health Organization; adverse event; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; infection control; mask; microbiology; nebulizer; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; prevention and control; procedures; respiratory function; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Betacoronavirus; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Coronavirus Infections; Exhalation; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Masks; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Pandemics; Particle Size; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Physiological Phenomena","32311771","Anaesthesia",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083962215

We conducted a literature review of studies (n = 12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n = 12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications. © 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2020 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug response; enzyme activity; human; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; Review; risk assessment; animal; blood; Coronavirus infection; dose response; metabolism; pandemic; urine; virus pneumonia; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Coronavirus Infections; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral","32320478","Clin.

Classification of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the current definitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difficult, and our aim was to develop case definitions for IAPA that can facilitate clinical studies. Methods: A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of IAPA and proposed a case definition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus. Results: Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. The entry criterion was defined as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive influenza test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infiltrates or a positive culture in upper respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infiltrates of recent onset. The IAPA case definitions may be useful to classify patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), while awaiting further studies that provide more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung. Conclusion: A consensus case definition of IAPA is proposed, which will facilitate research into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of this emerging acute and severe Aspergillus disease, and may be of use to study CAPA. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; ICU; Influenza; Invasive aspergillosis; Viral pneumonia","antifungal agent; corticosteroid; galactomannan; host factor; galactomannan; mannan; antifungal therapy; bronchoscopy; clinical feature; Conference Paper; consensus; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease severity; epidemiological data; fungus culture; fungus hyphae; human; influenza; intensive care unit; invasive aspergillosis; lung aspergillosis; lung infiltrate; lung lavage; nonhuman; pathogenesis; respiratory distress; tracheobronchitis; upper respiratory tract; Aspergillus; Betacoronavirus; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; chemistry; complication; consensus development; Coronavirus infection; influenza; isolation and purification; lung aspergillosis; microbiology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Antifungal Agents; Aspergillus; Betacoronavirus; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Influenza, Human; Intensive Care Units; Mannans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pulmonary Aspergillosis","32572532","Intensive Care Med.",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086790066

The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients. A culture of appropriate use has to be implemented between clinicians and patients’ groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adverse drug reactions; COVID-19; Dietary supplements; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Safety; SARS-CoV-2","acetylcysteine; androstenedione; antisense oligonucleotide; arginine; branched chain amino acid; citrulline; creatine; curcumin; dystrophin; epigallocatechin gallate; eteplirsen; fish oil; glucocorticoid; glutamine; golodirsen; heparin; leucine; melatonin; nutraceutical; nutrition supplement; omega 3 fatty acid; placebo; prasterone; resveratrol; sinecatechins; taurine; ubidecarenone; unindexed drug; utrophin; vitamin D; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; abnormal sensation; acute hepatitis; acute kidney failure; acute lung injury; adjuvant therapy; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amnesia; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; angina pectoris; angioneurotic edema; anorexia; aphasia; arthralgia; asthenia; asthma; atelectasis; atrial fibrillation; attention disturbance; backache; balance disorder; bleeding; blister; bloating; blurred vision; brain hemorrhage; bronchospasm; burning sensation; cataract; cell therapy; cerebrovascular accident; cheilitis; chill; cold sweat; complete heart block; confusion; constipation; contusion; convulsion; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid induced osteoporosis; coughing; decreased appetite; dehydration; depressed blood pressure; depression; diarrhea; diet supplementation; dietary supplement; disorientation; dizziness; drug blood level; drug contamination; drug megadose; drug potentiation; drug recall; drug safety; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; dysarthria; dysgeusia; dyskinesia; dysphagia; dyspnea; ear disease; ecchymosis; elevated blood pressure; energy drink; erythema; esophagus pain; evening dosage; face edema; failure to thrive; faintness; fatigue; fever; flank pain; flatulence; gait disorder; gallbladder disease; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal symptom; gene therapy; gingiva pain; hair disease; halitosis; headache; hearing impairment; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; heart infarction; heart palpitation; heart supraventricular arrhythmia; heartburn; hematuria; hepatic encephalopathy; hepatitis; hepatomegaly; human; hypercalcemia; hyperhidrosis; hyperkalemia; hypersensitivity; hypertension; hypertransaminasemia; hyperventilation; hypesthesia; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; hypokinesia; hyponatremia; hypophosphatemia; hypotension; iatrogenic disease; insomnia; insulin resistance; iron deficiency anemia; jaundice; jaw pain; joint swelling; kidney dysfunction; kidney failure; kidney pain; kidney tubule necrosis; lethargy; limb pain; liver failure; liver pain; lymphadenopathy; malaise; migraine without aura; motor dysfunction; muscle atrophy; muscle cramp; muscle metabolism; muscle necrosis; muscle spasm; muscle strength; muscle weakness; musculoskeletal stiffness; myalgia; myopathy; myotonia; nausea; neck pain; nephrolithiasis; neurologic disease; neutropenia; nocturia; nonhuman; osteomalacia; pain; panic; papular rash; paresthesia; peripheral edema; peripheral neuropathy; peripheral swelling; phlebitis; pleura effusion; priority journal; protein synthesis; pruritus; rash; recommended drug dose; rectum hemorrhage; retinol intoxication; Review; rhabdomyolysis; sarcopenia; seizure; serum sickness; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; side effect; sinus congestion; skin discoloration; skin disease; skin exfoliation; skull fracture; sleep disorder; speech disorder; spider vein; stomach discomfort; tachycardia; thorax pain; throat tightness; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; thrush; tongue edema; transient ischemic attack; tremor; upper abdominal pain; urinary urgency; urticaria; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin D intoxication; vomiting; weakness; wheezing; xerostomia; adverse event; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; dietary supplement; drug interaction; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; health care quality; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dietary Supplements; Drug Interactions; Humans; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Standard of Care","32485610","Pharmacol.

It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19’s cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic. The review suggested that artificial intelligence models have been used for the case detection of COVID-19. Similarly, big data platforms have also been applied for tracing contacts. However, the nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that have demonstrated good performance in feature selection of medical issues are yet to be explored for case detection and tracing of contacts in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study holds salient implications for practitioners and researchers alike as it elucidates the potentials of NIC in the accurate detection of pandemic cases and optimized contact tracing. © 2020 by the authors.

In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing.

Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients. We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19. Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020. All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion. Results: Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period. Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission. Conclusions: COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course. Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications. These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment. © 2020, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.",,"Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; general surgery; human; pandemic; postoperative period; procedures; treatment outcome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; General Surgery; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Postoperative Period; Treatment Outcome","32418028","World J.

Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether pre-existing cardiovascular disease is an independent determinant of higher mortality risk with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Acute cardiac injury, manifest by increased blood levels of cardiac troponin, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or myocardial dysfunction, occurs in up to ~60% of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Potential contributors to acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19 include (1) acute changes in myocardial demand and supply due to tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction; (2) acute coronary syndrome due to acute atherothrombosis in a virally induced thrombotic and inflammatory milieu; (3) microvascular dysfunction due to diffuse microthrombi or vascular injury; (4) stress-related cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome); (5) nonischemic myocardial injury due to a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; or (6) direct viral cardiomyocyte toxicity and myocarditis. Diffuse thrombosis is emerging as an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Practitioners should be vigilant for cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. Monitoring may include serial cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, along with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and inflammatory biomarkers. Management decisions should rely on the clinical assessment for the probability of ongoing myocardial ischemia, as well as alternative nonischemic causes of injury, integrating the level of suspicion for COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; receptor; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart muscle ischemia; human; myocarditis; nonhuman; pericarditis; pharmaceutical care; plasma; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism",,"Am.

Limitations in intensive care resources and personal protective equipment have required many practices throughout the globe to pause elective operations and now slowly resume operations. However, much of cardiac surgery is not elective and patients continue to require surgery on an urgent or emergent basis during the pandemic. This continued need for providing surgical services has introduced several unique considerations ranging from how to prioritize surgery, how to ensure safety for cardiac surgical teams, and how best to resume elective operations to ensure the safety of patients. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has required a careful analysis of how best to carry out heart transplantation, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, and congenital heart surgery. In this review, we present the many areas of multidisciplinary consideration, and the lessons learned that have allowed us to carry out cardiac surgery with excellence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bidimensional material graphene has captured much attention due to promising antimicrobial applications and has also demonstrated antiviral efficacy. In response to this global outbreak, we summarized the current state of knowledge of graphene and virus interaction as well as possible successful applications to fight COVID-19. Antibody-conjugated graphene sheets can rapidly detect targeted virus proteins and can be useful for large population screening, but also for the development of environmental sensors and filters, given the low cost of graphene materials. Functionalized graphene has demonstrated a good viral capture capacity that, combined with heat or light-mediated inactivation, could be used as a disinfectant. Graphene sensors arrays can be implemented on standard utility textiles and drug efficacy screening. Thanks to its high versatility, we foresee that graphene may have a leading role in the fight against COVID-19. © 2020",,"amine; antibody graphene conjugate; beta cyclodextrin derivative; carbon; cell receptor; curcumin; disinfectant agent; glycerol; graphene; graphene oxide; helicase; hypericin; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; nucleoprotein; silver nitrate; single stranded DNA; sulfone; titanium dioxide; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus antibody; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; DNA binding; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; enzyme inhibition; Feline coronavirus; health care personnel; heat; Human respiratory syncytial virus; hydrogen bond; immunomodulation; Influenza A virus; light; limit of detection; lipid bilayer; mass screening; nonhuman; Note; oxidation reduction reaction; pandemic; pneumonia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; static electricity; sulfation; surface property; virus attachment; virus inactivation; virus inhibition; virus replication",,"Nano Today",Note,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084485185

They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. Methods: By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed. Results: It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples. Conclusion: There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed. Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families. Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children. © 2020 The British Infection Association","Children; China; Clinical Characteristics; Coronavirus disease 2019; Transmission Ddynamics","asymptomatic disease; China; Chinese; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; feces analysis; human; incidence; information processing; lymphocyte count; pediatrician; personal experience; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; female; infant; lung; male; newborn; pandemic; pathology; preschool child; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lung; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32360500","J.

The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level. Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor. Method: This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans. Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed. Comments: COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world. Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate – are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems. © The Author(s) 2020.","coping; coronavirus pandemic; COVID-19; mental health; mindfulness and well-being; misinfodemics; psychological problems; psychosocial issues; resilience; social and behavioral epidemiology; stigma","Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; human; mental health; pandemic; procedures; psychological resilience; psychology; quarantine; social isolation; social stigma; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Resilience, Psychological; Social Isolation; Social Stigma","32434402","Int.

Data sources: We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications. To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender. There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. Results: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60 % more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. Limitations: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. Conclusions: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities. Implications of key findings: Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities. This may have implications in terms of vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for long-term health issues concerning gender equality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Complications; Covid-19; Fatality rate; Gender difference; Sex difference","comorbidity; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; immune response; intensive care unit; limit of quantitation; male; Medline; meta analysis; mortality rate; null result; prevalence; Review; screening test; sex difference; systematic review","32425315","Maturitas",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086178634

Key findings: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. Conclusion: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital, as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. Implications for practice: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments. © 2020","Chest; COVID-19; CT; Guidelines; Imaging; Radiography","C reactive protein; D dimer; blood analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; echography; follow up; health care management; health care planning; human; image analysis; incidence; infection control; infection risk; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occupational safety; pathophysiology; patient safety; point of care testing; practice guideline; priority journal; protein blood level; radiographer; radiology department; Review; thorax radiography; throat culture; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; Doppler ultrasonography; female; male; occupational health; organization and management; pandemic; patient care; prevention and control; procedures; radiologist; radiology department; safety; sensitivity and specificity; severe acute respiratory syndrome; vertical transmission; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Occupational Health; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Patient-Centered Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiography, Thoracic; Radiologists; Radiology Department, Hospital; Safety Management; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography, Doppler","32532596","Radiography",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086096197

Unlike the previous emerging coronaviruses (ECoVs) which neurological complexities were uncommon, with neurological features exhibition at 14–25 days post-onset, yet with critical outcomes exhibiting >50% mortality in central nervous (CNS) presenting pathologies. The COVID 19 neurological consequences occur more frequently even in mild cases, presenting with CNS involvement in up to 25%, musculoskeletal and peripheral manifestation (PNM). Through preceding ECoVs case reports, the PNM not linked to fatal outcomes, however, required, repeated neuro-imaging as notable CT and MRI changes appeared as late as 21 days while the likelihood of Cerebrospinal fluid to test positive for ECoV was 25%, only in the CNS presenting cases. Owing to 44–60% myalgia presentation, risk of the high inflammatory state, and coagulation cascade abnormalities reported in ECoVs, testing for C-reactive protein, serum creatine kinase, and D-dimer level is mandatory. Presently, there is no antiviral medication or vaccination for the ECoVs, early induction of antiviral drugs remains the backbone of management. Neurologically, the therapeutic dosages of anticoagulants are linked to the high incidence of thrombotic complexities, while methylprednisolone is associated with myopathy.

We anticipate changes in how we interact with our patients and other providers, how patient workflow is designed, the methods used to conduct our teaching sessions, and how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of the present report is to review some of the changes to consider in the clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow and, allow for a smoother transition, with less risk to our patients and healthcare personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and nonclinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for COVID-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and establishing the epidemiologic linkage will be crucial to containing and preventing new COVID-19 cases until a vaccine or an alternate solution is available. Additionally, the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs and personal protective equipment, the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, the increase in overhead costs, and the possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary, must be considered. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths will likely continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or the next 12 to 24 months. Thus, we must prioritize surgery, balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain COVID-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment, and ethical values to continue to deliver high-quality, economical, and accessible patient care. © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",,"antiinfective agent; coronavirus disease 2019; dental surgeon; emergency care; health care personnel; health care policy; human; infection control; infection prevention; infection risk; outpatient; patient care; patient preference; quarantine; Review; telemedicine; virus transmission; workflow; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; dental surgeon; occupational exposure; oral surgery; organization and management; pandemic; prevention and control; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Surgery, Oral; Workflow","32479811","J.

Care has been transformed by the crisis, but enduring lessons have been learned. In this article, we review how COVID-19 will impact cirrhosis care. We describe how this impact unfolds over 3 waves; i) an intense period with prioritized high-acuity care with delayed elective procedures and routine care during physical distancing, ii) a challenging ‘return to normal’ following the end of physical distancing, with increased emergent decompensations, morbidity, and systems of care overwhelmed by the backlog of deferred care, and iii) a protracted period of suboptimal outcomes characterized by missed diagnoses, progressive disease and loss to follow-up. We outline the concrete steps required to preserve the quality of care provided to patients with cirrhosis. This includes an intensification of the preventative care provided to patients with compensated cirrhosis, proactive chronic disease management, robust telehealth programs, and a reorganization of care delivery to provide a full service of care with flexible clinical staffing. Managing the pandemic of a serious chronic disease in the midst of a global infectious pandemic is challenging.

Sensory impairments of the olfactory and gustatory systems have also been reported in a large proportion of the cases, indicating the involvement of the peripheral nervous system.

Currently, several vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are in clinical trials but approval of these vaccines is likely to take a long time before they are available for public use. In a previous report, the importance of passive immunity and how immunoglobulin (Ig)G collected from recovered coronavirus patients could help in the protection against COVID-19 and boost the immune system of new patients was reported. Passive immunity by immunoglobulin transfer is a concept employed by most mammals and bovine IgG has a role to play in human therapy. IgG is one of the major components of the immunological activity found in cow's milk and colostrum. Heterologous transfer of passive immunity associated with the consumption of bovine immune milk by humans has been investigated for decades for its immunological activity against infections. This short review focuses on passive immunity and how microfiltered raw immune milk or colostrum collected from cows vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 could provide short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and could be used as an option until a vaccine becomes commercially available. © Copyright © 2020 Jawhara.","colostrum; coronavirus; COVID-19; IgG; immune milk; immunoglobulin; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Front.

Current epidemiological studies suggest that COVID-19 affects older patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic lung diseases. The differences in the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are likely to be multifaceted, depending on various biological, social, and economical factors. Specifically, the socioeconomic differences and psychological impact of COVID-19 affecting males and females are essential in pandemic mitigation and preparedness. Previous clinical studies have shown that females are less susceptible to acquire viral infections and reduced cytokine production. Female patients have a higher macrophage and neutrophil activity as well as antibody production and response. Furthermore, in-vivo studies of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) showed higher expression in the kidneys of male than female patients, which may explain the differences in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19 between male and female patients. However, it remains unknown whether the expression of ACE2 differs in the lungs of male or female patients. Disparities in healthcare access and socioeconomic status between ethnic groups may influence COVID-19 rates. Ethnic groups often have higher levels of medical comorbidities and lower socioeconomic status, which may increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 through weak cell-mediated immunity. In this article, we examine the current literature on the gender and racial differences among COVID-19 patients and further examine the possible biological mechanisms underlying these differences. © Copyright © 2020 Kopel, Perisetti, Roghani, Aziz, Gajendran and Goyal.","coronavirus; COVID-19; gender; pandemic; race; SARS-CoV-2; sex",,,"Front.

At present, the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is made through a nasopharyngeal swab based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. However, some recent studies suggested the possible role of oral fluids and saliva in the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this scoping review is evaluating the available evidence regarding the efficacy of saliva as a diagnostic specimen in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic literature review of six databases (PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], Science Direct, Web of Science and Google scholar) was carried out without any restrictions on date of publication to identify the reliability of saliva as a diagnostic specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. Results: Nine eligible articles were included in this review based on our described method. All the included studies are based on clinical surveys among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of studies included in this review, reported that there is no statistically significant difference between nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens and saliva samples regarding viral load.

It was first detected in the Wuhan city of China and has spread globally resulting in a substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified different aspects of this disease. There have been no published systematic reviews that combine clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, and mortality findings. Also, the effect of gender on the outcomes of COVID-19 has not been well-defined. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. P < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1,223 studies, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 5,057 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5–87.6) and cough (65.2%, CI 58.6–71.2) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5%, CI 12.7–24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9%, CI 6.0–23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0%, CI 54.3–84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0–62.4) were the most common. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1–78.0) was the most common CT scan presentation. The pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2–9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a significant number of hospitalization and mortality worldwide. Mortality associated with COVID-19 was higher in our study compared to the previous reports from China. The mortality was significantly higher among the hospitalized male group. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of different variables resulting in sex disparity in COVID-19 mortality. © Copyright © 2020 Nasiri, Haddadi, Tahvildari, Farsi, Arbabi, Hasanzadeh, Jamshidi, Murthi and Mirsaeidi.","coronavirus; COVID-19; male; mortality; pandemic",,,"Front.

The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory tract infection signs. Almost all populations are susceptible to the virus, and the basic reproduction number (R 0) is 2.8-3.9. The fight against COVID-19 should have two aspects: one is the treatment of infected patients, and the other is the mobilization of the society to avoid the spread of the virus. The treatment of patients includes supportive treatment, antiviral treatment, and oxygen therapy. For patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and circulatory support are recommended. Plasma therapy and traditional Chinese medicine have also achieved good outcomes. This review is intended to summarize the research on this new coronavirus, to analyze the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and to provide guidance regarding new methods of prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment based on autodock simulations. Methods: This review compares the multifaceted characteristics of the three coronaviruses including COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Our researchers take the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS as key words and search literatures in the Pubmed database. We compare them horizontally and vertically which respectively means concluding the individual characteristics of each coronavirus and comparing the similarities and differences between the three coronaviruses. Results: We searched for studies on each outbreak and their solutions and found that the main biological differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are in ORF1a and the sequence of gene spike coding protein-S. We also found that the types and severity of clinical symptoms vary, which means that the diagnosis and nursing measures also require differentiation. In addition to the common route of transmission including airborne transmission, these three viruses have their own unique routes of transmission such as fecal-oral route of transmission COVID-19. Conclusions: In evolutionary history, these three coronaviruses have some similar biological features as well as some different mutational characteristics. Their receptors and routes of transmission are not all the same, which makes them different in clinical features and treatments. We discovered through the autodock simulations that Met124 plays a key role in the efficiency of drugs targeting ACE2, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, ciclesonide and niclosamide, and may be a potential target in COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).","Autodock; Coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; SARS","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus receptors; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; virus receptor; animal; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; disease carrier; genetics; human; laboratory technique; metabolism; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; molecular docking; pandemic; physiology; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; ultrastructure; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Molecular Docking Simulation; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32690096","Infect.

Traditional Chinese Patent Medicines (CPMs) have, however, been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China, and a number of clinical practice results have shown them to have a significant role in its treatment. Consequently, numerous guidelines and expert consensus have recommended the use of CPMs to treat COVID-19. Aim of the Study: The objectives of this review are to provide up-to-date information on the pharmacology and clinical research on CPMs in the treatment of COVID-19, discuss the research findings, and to better guide clinical application and scientific research on CPMs in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: The frequencies of CPM recommendations by guidelines and expert consensus for treatment of COVID-19 in China were ranked. This report identifies the top 10 CPMs, which include Huoxiang Zhengqi capsule (HXZQC), Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LHQWC), Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), Shufeng Jiedu capsule (SFJDC), Tanreqing injection (TRQI), Xiyanping injection (XYPI), Xuebijing injection (XBJI), Shenfu injection (SFI), Shengmai injection (SMI), and Angong Niuhuang pill (AGNHP). Relevant studies from 2000 to 2020 on these top 10 CPMs, covering usage, dosage, mechanism, curative effect, and precautions, were collected from pharmacopoeia, reports, and theses via library and digital databases (including PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Elsevier). Results: The properties of the top 10 CPMs included antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic, anti-acute lung injury, anti-shock, immune regulation, and enhancement of pulmonary function. In addition, clinical research results and Chinese treatment data showed that the CPMs had good therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, and adverse reactions were minimal. Conclusions: Knowledge of the characteristics of the top 10 CPMs and precautions that should be taken may help clinicians to rationally improve therapeutic efficacy, and promote the role of Chinese Medicine in the control of the COVID-19 global epidemic. © Copyright © 2020 Zhuang, Fan, Chu, Wang, Yang, Wu, Sun, Sun, Shen, Lin, Guo and Xi.","Chinese Patent Medicines; clinical application; COVID-19; pharmacological action; Traditional Chinese Medicine","amantadine; angong niuhuang pill; arbidol; Chinese drug; huoxiang zhengqi capsule; interferon; jinhua qinggan granule; lianhua qingwen capsule; oseltamivir; paracetamol; ribavirin; shenfu injection; shengmai injection; shufeng jiedu capsule; tanreqing injection; unclassified drug; xiyanping injection; xuebijing injection; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; acute lung injury; allergic reaction; analgesic activity; anaphylaxis; antibacterial activity; antiinflammatory activity; antipyretic activity; antiviral activity; appetite disorder; asthma; avian influenza (H5N1); backache; brain hematoma; bronchitis; chill; China; Chinese medicine; Chinese patent medicine; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical research; coma; common cold; community acquired pneumonia; conjunctiva disease; convulsion; cornea edema; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cyanosis; diarrhea; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug fever; drug indication; drug mechanism; drug safety; dyspnea; face edema; fever; gastrointestinal disease; headache; heart arrhythmia; heart palpitation; heartburn; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; hypotension; hypothermia; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunoregulation; influenza; influenza A (H1N1); infusion related reaction; intestine obstruction; larynx edema; liver dysfunction; liver injury; low back pain; medicinal plant; nausea; nephrosis; nonhuman; pain; paresthesia; phlebitis; pneumonia; pruritus; purpura; rash; respiratory failure; retching; Review; sepsis; shivering; shock; sinus arrest; stomach discomfort; stomach pain; swelling; systematic review; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; thorax pain; tuberculosis; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract infection; urticaria; viral gastroenteritis; virus encephalitis; virus pneumonia; visual disorder; vomiting; xerostomia",,"Front.

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C–25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; Method; Occurrence; SARS-CoV-2; Survival; Water disinfection","Diseases; Groundwater; Health risks; Importance sampling; Potable water; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Transmissions; Viruses; Comprehensive research; Concentration method; Contaminated drinking water; Electronic database; Human enteric virus; Human-to-human transmission; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Waterborne transmission; Cobalt alloys; oxidizing agent; concentration (composition); methodology; persistence; public health; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; wastewater; water pollution; aquatic environment; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; enteric virus; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; temperature measurement; virus transmission; water borne disease; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Middle East; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32361598","Water Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084064698

A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water. Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water. In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments. Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids. Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution. HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods. The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle. © 2020","Coronavirus; Recovery efficiency; SARS-CoV-2; Survival; Wastewater; Water","Efficiency; River pollution; Sewage; Viruses; Analytical method; Detection methods; Microbial pollution; Recovery efficiency; Removal efficiencies; Scientific literature; State of the art; Water environments; Public health; water; detection method; disease spread; disease transmission; knowledge; persistence; public health; temperature effect; virus; water treatment; agricultural slurry; biosolid; environment; environmental monitoring; human; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; public health; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; systematic review; virus detection; virus survival; virus transmission; waste water management; water cycle; water pollution; water sampling; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; public health; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","32389891","Water Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084199002

CNS manifestations include: headache and decreased responsiveness considered initial indicators of potential neurological involvement; anosmia, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and dysgeusia are frequent early symptoms of coronavirus infection. Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 264,679 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified. There are isolated reports of seizures, encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. The neurological diseases affecting the PNS and muscle in COVID-19 are less frequent and include Guillain-Barré syndrome; Miller Fisher syndrome; polyneuritis cranialis; and rare instances of viral myopathy with rhabdomyolysis. The main conclusion of this review is the pressing need to define the neurology of COVID-19, its frequency, manifestations, neuropathology and pathogenesis. On behalf of the World Federation of Neurology we invite national and regional neurological associations to create local databases to report cases with neurological manifestations observed during the on-going pandemic. International neuroepidemiological collaboration may help define the natural history of this worldwide problem. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; COVID-19 neurological complications; Endotheliitis; Environmental neurology, MERS; MERS-CoV; Neuroepidemiology; Neuropathology; Pandemic; SARS; SARS-CoV-1; SARS-CoV-2; Viral neurotropism; Zoonosis","acute brain disease; altered state of consciousness; animal model; artery thrombosis; blood clotting disorder; brain disease; brain hemorrhage; brain necrosis; brain perfusion; central nervous system disease; cerebrovascular disease; China; clinical feature; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; data base; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; human; Middle East respiratory syndrome; muscle disease; myasthenia gravis; myelitis; myopathy; neuritis; neurologic disease; neurology; neuropathology; peripheral neuropathy; polyneuritis cranialis; priority journal; register; Review; Saudi Arabia; seizure; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling disorder; subarachnoid hemorrhage; taste disorder; taxonomy; vein thrombosis; virus encephalitis; virus meningitis; adult; animal; antibody specificity; Betacoronavirus; cerebrovascular disease; communicable disease; complication; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; neurologic disease; neuromuscular disease; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; register; thrombophilia; ultrastructure; vascular endothelium; veterinary medicine; viral tropism; virology; virus pneumonia; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; Adult; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Models, Animal; Nervous System Diseases; Neuromuscular Diseases; Organ Specificity; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Registries; Thrombophilia; Viral Tropism","32464367","J.

As a result, some models make assumptions about the percentage of detected cases among total infections while others completely neglect undetected cases. Here, we illustrate how model projections about case and fatality numbers vary significantly under varying assumptions on the detection ratio. Uncertainties in model predictions can be significantly reduced by representative testing, both for antibodies and active virus RNA, to uncover past and current infections that have gone undetected thus far. © 2020 The Author(s).","Case fatality ratio; COVID-19; Detection ratio; Mathematical modeling; Simulation",,,"Arch.

Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1-7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries. Graphical abstract: SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor. The cell-free and macrophage-phagocytosed virus can spread to other organs and infect ACE2-expressing cells at local sites, causing multi-organ injury.

As of June 19, 2020, the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed more than 8.7 million confirmed cases in over 200 countries/regions. The WHO has declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.

The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2.

An early clinical report showed that fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, and myalgia were initial symptoms, with the development of pneumonia as the disease progressed. Increases in the level of serum liver enzymes, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I, and creatinine have been observed in severely ill patients, indicating that multiple organ failure had occurred in these cases. Lymphopenia and an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also observed. Although COVID-19 patients are administered glucocorticoid therapy to treat the excessive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the efficacy of this form of therapy is unclear. Viremia is observed in severe cases, suggesting that in addition to type II alveolar epithelial cells, many cell types, such as vascular endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, renal tubular cells, neuronal cells, and lymphocytes, may be damaged. The improvement of survival rates requires elucidation of the mechanism by which cellular damage occurs during viral infection. Cellular therapy, along with organ support systems such as oxygen therapy, artificial ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis, as well as antiviral therapy, are required. Viral replication in infected host cells may perturb protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. Although an adaptive cellular response, i.e. the unfolded protein response, can compensate for the misfolded protein burden to some extent, continued viral proliferation may induce inflammation and cell death. Therefore, we propose that proteostasis dysfunction may cause conformational disorders in COVID-19. The application of pharmacological chaperone therapy to treat COVID-19 patients is additionally discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Aoe.","apoptosis; BiP; COVID-19; ER stress; pharmacological chaperone; proteostasis; SARS-CoV-2; unfolded protein response (UPR)","4 phenylbutyric acid; alanine aminotransferase; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; D dimer; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glucocorticoid; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; remdesivir; taurodeoxycholic acid; troponin I; tumor necrosis factor; artificial ventilation; cardiac muscle cell; cell damage; cell death; cell therapy; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; endoplasmic reticulum stress; extracorporeal oxygenation; fatigue; fever; hemodialysis; host cell; human; hypertransaminasemia; immune response; inflammation; kidney tubule cell; lung alveolus epithelium cell; lymphocyte; lymphocytopenia; multiple organ failure; myalgia; nerve cell; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; pandemic; pneumonia; protein folding; protein homeostasis; protein misfolding; Review; sputum; survival rate; symptom; unfolded protein response; vascular endothelial cell; viremia; virus replication",,"Front.

The city has extensive ties to Hubei Province, the first reported epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the world. Initial predictions suggested Shenzhen would experience a high number of COVID-19 cases. These predictions have not materialized. As of 31 March 2020 Shenzhen had only 451 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Contact tracing has shown that no cases were the result of community transmission within the city. While Shenzhen did not implement a citywide lockdown like Wuhan, it did put into place a rapid response system first developed after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. In the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, Shenzhen health authority created a network for surveillance and responding to novel respiratory infections, including pneumonia of unknown causes (PUC). The network rapidly detected mass discussion about PUC and immediately deployed emergency preparedness, quarantine for close contacts of PUC. Five early actions (early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment) and four centralized responses (centralized coordination by experts, centralized allocation of resources, centralized placement of patients, and centralized provision of treatment) ensured effective prevention and control. Tripartite working teams comprising community cadres, medical personnel and police were formulated to conduct contact tracing at each neighborhood and residential community. Incorporation of mobile technology, big data, and artificial intelligence into COVID-19 response increased accessibility to health services, reduced misinformation and minimized the impact of fake news. Shenzhen's unique experience in successfully controlling the COVID-19 outbreak may be a useful model for countries and regions currently experiencing rapid spread of the virus. © 2020 The Author(s).","China; Control; COVID-19; Outbreak; Shenzhen","artificial intelligence; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; early diagnosis; epidemic; government; hand washing; health insurance; health service; human; infection control; infection prevention; intensive care; lockdown; medical personnel; pneumonia; police; practice guideline; priority journal; psychosocial care; quarantine; Review; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social isolation; Betacoronavirus; city; communicable disease control; community acquired infection; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; organization and management; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; Community-Acquired Infections; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32650840","Infect.

Numerous cancer patients from non-Western countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), seek cancer care outside their home countries and many are sponsored by their governments for treatment. Many patients interrupted their cancer treatment abruptly and so returned to their home countries with unique challenges. In this review we will discuss practical challenges and recommendations for all cancer patients returning to their home countries from treatment abroad. Method: Experts from medical, surgical and other cancer subspecialties in the UAE were invited to form a taskforce to address challenges and propose recommendations for patients returning home from abroad after medical tourism during the SARS-COV-19 Pandemic. Results: The taskforce which consisted of experts from medical oncology, hematology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, radiology and palliative care summarized the current challenges and suggested a practical approaches to address these specific challenges to improve the returning cancer patients care. Lack of medical documentation, pathology specimens and radiology images are one of the major limitations on the continuation of the cancer care for returning patients. Difference in approaches and treatment recommendations between the existing treating oncologists abroad and receiving oncologists in the UAE regarding the optimal management which can be addressed by early and empathic communications with patients and by engaging the previous treating oncologists in treatment planning based on the available resources and expertise in the UAE. Interruption of curative radiotherapy (RT) schedules which can potentially increase risk of treatment failure has been a major challenge, RT dose-compensation calculation should be considered in these circumstances. Conclusion: The importance of a thorough clinical handover cannot be overstated and regulatory bodies are needed to prevent what can be considered unethical procedure towards returning cancer patients with lack of an effective handover. Clear communication is paramount to gain the trust of returning patients and their families. This pandemic may also serve as an opportunity to encourage patients to receive treatment locally in their home country. Future studies will be needed to address the steps to retain cancer patients in the UAE rather than seeking cancer treatment abroad. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"advisory committee; Betacoronavirus; consensus; Coronavirus infection; human; medical tourism; neoplasm; oncology; organization and management; pandemic; patient care; United Arab Emirates; virus pneumonia; Advisory Committees; Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Continuity of Patient Care; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Medical Tourism; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United Arab Emirates","32650756","BMC Cancer",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088200838

Several therapeutic strategies can be envisaged to prevent further mortality and morbidity. Based on the past contribution of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and immune-based therapies as a treatment option in crucial pathogen outbreaks, we aimed to summarize potential therapeutic strategies that could be helpful to stop further spread of SARS-CoV-2 by effecting its structural components or modulation of immune responses. Several TCM with or without modification could be effective against the structural protein, enzymes, and nucleic acid should be tested from available libraries or to identify their immune-stimulatory activities to enhance several antiviral biological agents for effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from the host. TCM is not only effective in the direct inhibition of virus attachment and internalization in a cell but can also prevent their replication and can also help to boost up host immune response. Immune-modulatory effects of TCMs may lead to new medications and can guide us for the scientific validity of drug development. Besides, we also summarized the effective therapies in clinical for controlling inflammation.

It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses.

Methods: Literature review and expert opinion. Short conclusion: SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing COVID-19, is considered to be transmitted via droplets rather than aerosols, but droplets with strong directional airflow support may spread further than 2 m. High rates of COVID-19 infections in healthcare-workers (HCWs) have been reported from several countries. Respirators such as filtering face piece (FFP) 2 masks were designed to protect HCWs, while surgical masks were originally intended to protect patients (e.g., during surgery). Nevertheless, high quality standard surgical masks (type II/IIR according to European Norm EN 14683) appear to be as effective as FFP2 masks in preventing droplet-associated viral infections of HCWs as reported from influenza or SARS. So far, no head-to-head trials with these masks have been published for COVID-19. Neither mask type completely prevents transmission, which may be due to inappropriate handling and alternative transmission pathways. Therefore, compliance with a bundle of infection control measures including thorough hand hygiene is key. During high-risk procedures, both droplets and aerosols may be produced, reason why respirators are indicated for these interventions. © 2020 The Author(s).","Aerosol; COVID-19; Droplet; Infection control; Mask; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission","aerosol; airborne particle; asymptomatic infection; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; hand washing; health care personnel; hospital infection; human; infection control; infection prevention; infection rate; isolation; nonhuman; occupational health; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sneezing; virus transmission; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; health care personnel; microbiology; pandemic; physiology; prevention and control; protective equipment; virology; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Devices","32631450","Antimicrob.

As the number of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is increasing and the epidemic is spreading, many hospitals, laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have developed diagnostic reagents that can detect SARS-CoV-2. Currently, genome sequencing or real-time PCR is a method for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been reported cases of negative results by nucleic acid detection but confirmed on the radiological CT scan. How to improve the diagnostic efficiency and the sensitivity of molecular detection remains to be solved. To analyze the variations in viral genomic sequence may be helpful in guiding the prevention and treatment of diseases infected by SARS-CoV-2. At present, controversy still exists over the source of SARS-CoV-2 even though the probable origin is bat in nature. This article summarizes the recent findings of SARS-CoV-2 from genetic, virological and evolutionary biological perspectives. By comparing the genomic variations among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, we hope the findings can be used in the viral detection and potential antiviral therapy. Also, it will be great if we can trace the spread of the virus from one person to another, which will be an much effective way to predict and control the spread from the virus-carrier without symptoms at the incubation period to the others. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences).

It is controversial whether the virus can be transmitted via tears and its ocular implications have not been widely studied. In this article, the current evidence related to ocular transmission and ocular manifestations is reviewed. Results: Several mechanisms for the ocular transmission of the virus are proposed with highlight on the nasolacrimal system as a conduit between the eye and the respiratory tract, and the role of the lacrimal gland in hematogenous spread. Ocular surface manifestations such as conjunctivitis are more commonly reported. Conclusion: The exact pathophysiology of ocular transmission of the virus remains incompletely understood, although there is preliminary evidence of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in ocular secretions.

Research on synthetic drugs and vaccines has become a focus of attention in China and other countries, as such approaches are regarded as key tools for disease prevention and control; however, the development of these therapeutics will take months, or even years. Under such circumstances, development of coronavirus specific therapeutics is urgent. For this specific indication, the rapid performance of natural products, such as plant compounds, herbal extracts, and traditional Chinese medicine, could contribute as alternative measures. Recent investigations have provided evidence that these natural products are potential candidates for development as therapeutic agents against the virus that causes COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. Targeting the structural proteins or cellular receptors of 2019-nCoV, including coronavirus chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro or Mpro), helicase (nsP13), S protein, and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), holds promise for preventing infection. In this review, we summarize some representative natural products and their active components that have potential anti-2019-nCoV effects. We focus on the basic structural elements of 2019-nCoV, its main mechanisms of action, and the feasibility and potential of products to inhibit the novel coronavirus. In addition, the relative advantages, additional functions, and precautions that should be used with typical natural products are also discussed. The aim is to make the case that natural products could be a valuable pool for the development of active compounds for treating 2019-nCoV infection, which may contribute to mitigation of the spread of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Zhou and Huang.","2019-nCoV; functional mechanisms; natural products; structural feature; therapeutic strategies",,,"Front.

More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far, while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment. Considering the global healthcare urgency, several techniques, including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging have been employed for diagnosing infected people. Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented. © 2020 by the authors.

Previous influenza pandemics showed that socioeconomic factors may determine both disease detection rates and overall outcomes, and preliminary data from the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic suggests that this is still true. Over the past years it has become clear that early-life adversity (ELA) plays a critical role biasing the immune system towards a pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype many years later. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) appear to be particularly sensitive to the early life social environment. As we understand more about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 it appears that a functional CTL (CD8+) response is required to clear the infection and COVID-19 severity is increased as the CD8+ response becomes somehow diminished or exhausted. This raises the hypothesis that the ELA-induced pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotype may play a role in determining the clinical course of COVID-19, and the convergence of ELA-induced senescence and COVID-19 induced exhaustion represents the worst-case scenario with the least effective T-cell response. If the correct data is collected, it may be possible to separate the early life elements that have made people particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 many years later. This will, naturally, then help us identify those that are most at risk from developing the severest forms of COVID-19. In order to do this, we need to recognize socioeconomic and early-life factors as genuine medically and clinically relevant data that urgently need to be collected. Finally, many biological samples have been collected in the ongoing studies. The mechanisms linking the early life environment with a defined later-life phenotype are starting to be elucidated, and perhaps hold the key to understanding inequalities and differences in the severity of COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to inflammatory reactions at high vector doses, adjunctive treatment may be necessary to enhance the therapeutic outcome. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have been successfully used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Evidence suggests that at high concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can impact viral infection and replication by increasing endosomal and lysosomal pH. This effect has led to investigations into the potential benefits of these drugs in the treatment of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, at lower concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine appear to exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting nucleic acid sensors, including toll-like receptor 9 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. This dosedependent effect on their mechanism of action supports observations of increased viral infections associated with lower drug doses. In this review, we explore the immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, their impact on viral infections, and their potential to improve the efficacy and safety of retinal gene therapy by reducing AAV-induced immune responses. The safety and practicalities of delivering hydroxychloroquine into the retina will also be discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

Another group of diagnostic tests, developed to overcome the limitations of RT-PCR, includes the serological assays, which have the purpose of detecting the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (IgM and IgG titers). The aim of this review was to establish the diagnostic capability of the existing serological tests in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: Electronic research was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Cochrane Library, and only 10 articles, testing 10 different types of serological assays, met the inclusion criteria and were consequently submitted to quality assessment and data extraction. Quantitative data about the sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value and IgM/IgG titer provided by each antibody test were reported in our review. Results: Almost all the serological tests used in the included items were recorded to ensure high sensitivity and specificity, identifying the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with certain COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed by RT-PCR) and in participants with suspected infection (SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnosis and/or RT-PCR negative subjects). Conclusions: Serological tests may represent reliable diagnostic tools in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they could be implemented complementary to real-time RT-PCR. © 2020 by the authors.

The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV‑2, is highly variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV‑2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV‑2 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about SARS-CoV‑2, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that a remedy for this disease will soon be found. COVID-19 will nonetheless have a lasting impact on human society. © 2020, The Author(s).","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Antiviral drug; Coronavirus disease 2019; Pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Vaccine",,,"Neth.

Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in response to serious public health. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like nausea, headache, and vomiting. Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not only causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through a synapse-connected route. SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and experimental animals' brains. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients. All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

This pandemic presents a huge challenge for the healthcare system and also for ophthalmologists. Previous studies and case reports indicated that SARS-CoV‑2 also infects the conjunctiva resulting in conjunctivitis. In addition, infectious virus particles in the tear fluid can be potential sources of infection; however, the detection of SARS-CoV‑2 RNA in the tear fluid has rarely been successful. Although isolated conjunctival involvement is highly unlikely, at the current point in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, practically every patient examined by an ophthalmologist could be infected with SARS-CoV‑2. Therefore, protective and hygiene measures should currently be consistently followed to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Currently, there are no treatment recommendations for conjunctivitis associated with COVID-19. Tear substitutes might be helpful for symptom relief but there is no evidence for a topical antiviral therapy.

SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement. Objective: To review the neurological aspects of SARS-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. Results: A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Encephalitis; Neurological manifestations; SARS-CoV-2","acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; cerebrovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; encephalitis; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; multiple sclerosis; neurologic disease; nonhuman; pathogenesis; peripheral neuropathy; polyneuropathy; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; brain; case report; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; neurologic disease; observational study; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Observational Studies as Topic; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32422545","Clin.

We excluded ongoing clinical studies as for unobtainable conclusive results. Of 2422 articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria for analysis and were included in the study. None of the studies were multinational. Among the 11 selected papers there were three original articles, one review, four letters, two editorials, and one correspondence letter. Globally, 252 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were included in our review. The prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis complicating the course of COVID-19 was demonstrated to be as high as 32% in one study only. Globally, three patients had conjunctivitis with a positive tear-PCR, 8 patients had positive tear-PCR in the absence of conjunctivitis, and 14 had conjunctivitis with negative tear-PCR. The majority of the available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 colonization of ocular and periocular tissues and secretions have to be considered controversial. However, it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 could both infect the eye and the surrounding structures. SARS-CoV-2 may use ocular structure as an additional transmission route, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 patients’ conjunctival secretion and tears positivity to reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2-RNA assay. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.",,"bodily secretions; clinical trial (topic); conjunctiva; conjunctivitis; cornea; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; eye tissue; human; lacrimal fluid; lacrimal sac; prevalence; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; eye disease; isolation and purification; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral conjunctivitis; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Conjunctiva; Conjunctivitis, Viral; Coronavirus Infections; Eye Diseases; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32425362","Eye",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085186176

The outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China. The patients presented clinical symptoms of dry cough, fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging. By February 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized and designated this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 uses the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), used by SARS-CoV to infect humans. One hypothesis of SARSCoV-2 origin indicates that it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARSCoV-2, being the intermediate host not yet determined. The predominant route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is from human to human.

Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals. © 2020 by the authors.

Previous studies had reported the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture media and deposited onto surfaces under a limited set of environmental conditions. Here, we broadly investigated the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and droplet size on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in a simulated clinically relevant matrix dried on nonporous surfaces. The results show that SARS-CoV-2 decayed more rapidly when either humidity or temperature was increased but that droplet volume (1 to 50 l) and surface type (stainless steel, plastic, or nitrile glove) did not significantly impact decay rate. At room temperature (24°C), virus half-life ranged from 6.3 to 18.6 h depending on the relative humidity but was reduced to 1.0 to 8.9 h when the temperature was increased to 35°C. These findings suggest that a potential for fomite transmission may persist for hours to days in indoor environments and have implications for assessment of the risk posed by surface contamination in indoor environments. IMPORTANCE Mitigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and public spaces is critically important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while effective vaccines and therapeutics are under development. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is thought to primarily occur through direct person-to-person transfer of infectious respiratory droplets or through aerosol-generating medical procedures. However, contact with contaminated surfaces may also play a significant role. In this context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies. To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify indoor environments in which the virus is most persistent. © 2020 Biryukov et al.","Contamination; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Fomite; Half-life; Humidity; SARS-CoV-2; Temperature; Transmission","environmental factor; high temperature; humidity; limit of detection; nonhuman; Note; polymerase chain reaction; room temperature; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface property; virus inactivation; virus transmission; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; fomite; half life time; human; indoor air pollution; pandemic; physiology; porosity; saliva; SARS coronavirus; surface property; temperature; theoretical model; virology; virus pneumonia; plastic; stainless steel; Air Pollution, Indoor; Coronavirus Infections; Fomites; Half-Life; Humans; Humidity; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Plastics; Pneumonia, Viral; Porosity; Saliva; SARS Virus; Stainless Steel; Surface Properties; Temperature; Virus Inactivation","32611701","mSphere",Note,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087472792

An understanding of current and developing testing methods is important for interpreting test results. Methods: We performed a literature review of current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing highlighting its utility, limitations, and implications for otolaryngologists. Results: The currently accepted RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 has varying sensitivity according to which subsite of the aerodigestive tract is sampled. Nasal swab sensitivities appear to be about 70%. Chest CT imaging for screening purposes is not currently recommended. Conclusion: Due to the current sensitivity of RT-PCR based testing for SARS-CoV-2, a negative test cannot rule out COVID-19. Full PPE should be worn during high-risk procedures such as aerosol generating procedures even if testing is negative.

Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus infecting the lungs with fever, dry cough, and acute pneumonia being the major symptoms. It infects epithelial cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is crucial for viral entry. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately there are various reports that substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including brain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and MERS along with possibilities of viral entry into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The review provides detailed information about the virulence, epidemiology, and insights into molecular pathways involved in the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with an in-depth view of current concepts about the neurological significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neuropathological competence.

Initially, little was known about the virus. As research continues, we now know the genome structure, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Based on this knowledge, potential targets involved in the processes of virus pathogenesis need to be identified, and the discovery or development of drugs based on these potential targets is the most pressing need. Here, we have summarized the potential therapeutic targets involved in virus pathogenesis and discuss the advances, possibilities, and significance of drugs based on these targets for treating SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this study was to systematically review main clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric age. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed database. Papers published between 1 January and 1 May 2020 including children aged 0–18 years were selected. Sixty-two studies and three reviews were included, with a total sample size of 7480 children (2428/4660 males, 52.1%; weighted mean age 7.6 years). Patients showed mainly mild (608/1432, 42.5%) and moderate (567/1432, 39.6%) signs of the infection. About 2% of children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The most commonly described symptoms were fever (51.6%) and cough (47.3%). Laboratory findings were often unremarkable. Children underwent a chest CT scan in 73.9% of all cases, and 32.7% resulted normal. Overall, the estimated mortality was 0.08%. A higher proportion of newborns was severely ill (12%) and dyspnea was the most common reported sign (40%). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 affects children less severely than adults. Laboratory and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific. Larger epidemiological and clinical cohort studies are needed to better understand possible implications of COVID-19 infection in children.What is Known:• A novel Coronavirus has been recently identified as responsible for a new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) spreading globally.• There is limited evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection in children.What is New:• Systematically reviewed available evidence showed that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a less severe pattern of disease in comparison to adults.• Blood tests and radiology findings are mainly nonspecific in children but may help to identify those who are severely ill. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Infectious disease; Neonatal; Novel coronavirus; Pandemic; Pediatrics","antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; C reactive protein; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin; interferon; procalcitonin; artificial ventilation; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dyspnea; fever; human; mortality; pediatric intensive care unit; pediatric patient; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; symptom; systematic review; thorax radiography; vomiting; x-ray computed tomography; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; global health; infant; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; procedures; prognosis; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32424745","Eur.

Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia. In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva). Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals. It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses. The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.

As of now, COVID-19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2’) within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. The cohesive approach amongst researchers across the globe has delivered high-end viral diagnostics. However, home-based point-of-care diagnostics are still under development, which may prove transformative in current COVID-19 pandemic containment. Similarly, vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 are currently in the pipeline for clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the noteworthy advancements, focusing on the etiological viral agent, comparative genomic analysis, population susceptibility, disease epidemiology and diagnosis, animal reservoirs, laboratory animal models, disease transmission, therapeutics, vaccine challenges, and disease mitigation measures. © 2020 by the authors.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Pandemic; Pathobiology; SARS-CoV-2; Therapeutics; Vaccines","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; favilavir; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 17; interleukin 7; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; remdesivir; tocilizumab; virus spike protein; 3' untranslated region; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amino acid sequence; artificial intelligence; basic reproduction number; Betacoronavirus; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease transmission; dyspnea; fatigue; gene sequence; hemophagocytic syndrome; high throughput sequencing; human; hypoxia; incidence; incubation time; malaise; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; myalgia; nonhuman; open reading frame; pandemic; phylogenomics; point of care testing; quarantine; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; susceptible population; tachycardia; throat culture; viremia; virus genome; virus replication; virus shedding; virus transmission",,"Pathogens",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087379672

Dysfunction of ACE2 leads to abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin system and a systemic endotheliitis that may relate to abnormal coagulation and sepsis. Meanwhile, innate immune response and inflammation activation participate in dysfunctional coagulation. Previous research indicated that dysfunctional coagulation was one of the important risk factors accountable for a high risk of severe disease and death in patients with COVID-19.

Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist in peripheral blood and may be capable of providing effective information about protective immunity.

This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. Methods: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” in conjunction with “otorhinolaryngological manifestation”, “ENT”, and “olfaction”. Results: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; ENT; Olfaction; Otolaryngological manifestations; SARS-CoV-2","alpha interferon; chloroquine; chymotrypsin inhibitor; cyclosporine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; favipiravir; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nelfinavir; remdesivir; thymosin alpha1; tocilizumab; anosmia; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease course; dizziness; dyspnea; groups by age; head and neck surgeon; human; hyposmia; infection risk; loop mediated isothermal amplification; medical practice; nose obstruction; otolaryngologist; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; priority journal; Review; rhinorrhea; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling; sore throat; sputum analysis; surgeon; Th2 cell; throat culture; upper respiratory tract infection; vaccination; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; ear nose throat surgery; otolaryngologist; pandemic; pharyngitis; respiratory system; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Humans; Otolaryngologists; Otolaryngology; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Pandemics; Pharyngitis; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory System","32306118","Eur.

Official names have been announced for the novel human coronavirus responsible for the pneumonia outbreak in China, and the disease it causes has been announced Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite great efforts worldwide to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the spread of the virus has recently reached a pandemic. Currently, infection prevention and control of this virus are the primary concerns for public health officials and professionals. In this review, the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential treatment options of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and the possible reasons for milder presentations of COVID-19 in children than in adults were discussed to provide an insight into the further characterization of COVID-19 in children. Evidence Acquisition: The most recent evidence about the clinical features and potential reasons for the non-susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been provided in the present narrative review. A systematic search was performed in some databases/search engines, including ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Then, the relevant published articles were reviewed. The keywords utilized for finding related articles were Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pediatric, COVID-19, treatment, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), clinical feature, coronavirus, and pneumonia. Results: Based on the findings, respiratory infections caused by the virus are more frequent in children aged five years or younger than in other age groups. However, the currently available data suggest that COVID-19 infection in children seems to be uncommon. Moreover, in the case of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the disease presentation is frequently milder than in adults and the overall burden in children was reported to be relatively low. Conclusions: Several explanations have been suggested to justify the milder symptoms in children than in adults, including differences in immunity systems of children and adults and differences in ACE2 expression as a receptor for virus attachment. Moreover, while children tend to present mild symptoms of infection, their role in the spread of the disease in the community should not be ignored. © 2020, Author(s).","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Clinical Feature; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pediatric; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Treatment",,,"Arch.

At present, there are still many unknowns about this infection, and much more unknown is the impact into the surgical field. Although evidence regarding the effect of SARS-CoV-2 and laparoscopic surgery is scarce, laparoscopy has been considered the method of choice by different scientific societies for most indications in gynaecology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the advantages over the open route. There is less morbidity and hospital stay, and in addition, as it involves autonomous and contained surgical procedures with respect to smoke release. Moreover, the instruments and the setting in the operating room mean that there can be safe distance from the surgeon and other staff to the patient. Overall, the main recommendations in laparoscopic surgery during the COVID era include: the use of Personal Protective Equipment for operating room personnel, and the adoption of safety measures to reduce CO2 exposure and surgical smoke release. © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Aerosols; COVID-19; Laparoscopic surgery; SARS-CoV-2; Surgical smoke evacuation",,,"Clin.

Generally causing mild clinical signs of persistent cough and nasal discharge, the virus is highly infectious and is most prevalent in rehoming shelters worldwide where dogs are often closely housed and infections endemic. As the world grapples with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is searching for a greater understanding of a novel virus infecting humans. Similar to other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have crossed the species barrier, most likely from bats, clearly reinforcing the One Health concept. Veterinary pathologists are familiar with coronavirus infections in animals, and now more than ever this knowledge and understanding, based on many years of veterinary research, could provide valuable answers for our medical colleagues.

To describe the state of the art of coronaviruses and airborne transmission, a systematic review was carried out using the PRISMA methodology. Overall, 64 papers were selected and classified into three main groups: laboratory experiments (12 papers), air monitoring (22) and epidemiological and airflow model studies (30). The airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is suggested by the studies of the three groups, but none has yet obtained complete evidence. The sampling and detection methods have not been validated, therefore monitoring results are affected by a possible underestimation. Then, epidemiological investigations only hypothesize the airborne transmission as a possible explanation for some illness cases, but without estimating its attributable risk. Nevertheless, while waiting for more evidence, it is urgent to base advice on preventive measures, such as the use of masks, safe distancing and air ventilation, on the precautionary principle. © 2020 by the authors.","Air models; Air monitoring; Airborne transmission; Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Epidemiological studies; Human coronaviruses; SARS-CoV-2; Survival in air","Risk perception; Airborne transmission; Attributable risks; Detection methods; Laboratory experiments; Monitoring results; Precautionary principle; Preventive measures; Systematic Review; Transmissions; airflow; COVID-19; disease control; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; experimental study; respiratory disease; Animalia; SARS coronavirus",,"Atmosphere",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088102187

Objectives: Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature. Sources: We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects. Content: We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options. Implications: The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density. However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians.

We reviewed current evidence related to the impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on dental care and oral health with the aim to help dental professionals better understand the risks of disease transmission in dental settings, strengthen protection against nosocomial infections, and identify areas of COVID-19–related oral health research. When compared with other recent pandemics, COVID-19 is less severe but spreads more easily, causing a significantly higher number of deaths worldwide. Protection of dental patients and staff during COVID-19 is challenging due to the existence of patients who are infectious yet asymptomatic. Dental professionals are ill prepared for the pandemic, as they are not routinely fitted for the N95 respirators now required for preventing contagion during dental treatments. Biological and clinical evidence supports that oral mucosa is an initial site of entry for SARS-CoV-2 and that oral symptoms, including loss of taste/smell and dry mouth, might be early symptoms of COVID-19, presenting before fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness breath, and other typical symptoms. Oral health researchers may play a more active role in early identification and diagnosis of the disease through deciphering the mechanisms of dry mouth and loss of taste in patients with COVID-19. Rapid testing for infectious diseases in dental offices via saliva samples may be valuable in the early identification of infected patients and in disease progress assessment. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This commentary provides a timely evidence-based overview on the impact of COVID-19 on dental care and oral health and identifies gaps in protection of patients and staff in dental settings. Oral symptoms are prominent before fever and cough occur.

ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies. Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers, and RAAS inhibitors. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines. In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity.

Pathogen-resistant individuals will always remain in the host population. In turn, the virus can never completely eliminate the host population, because evolutionarily such an event is a dead end for the virus as an obligate intracellular parasite. A certain existential balance exists in the virus-host relationship. Against this backdrop, viral epidemics and pandemics only become manifest and egregious to human beings when tens and hundreds of thousands of people die and the question emerges what caused the high mortality peaks on the death chart. The answer seems clear; the emerging strain of the virus is new to the host population, and new mutations of the virus and natural selection will lead to a survival of only genetically resistant individuals in a host population. The dangers inherent to a novel virus are due to new features generally inthe molecular structure of proteins, which enable the virus to infect the cells of the host organism more intensively, dramatically challenging host immunity, and thus be transmitted more readily in the host population. In this article, we will concentrate on the facts currently available about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and try to predict its development and consequences based on the virus-host relationship. In fact, only two scenarios will occur simultaneously in the very near future: people who are genetically resistant to the virus will get sick, recover, and develop immunity, while people who are sensitive to the virus will need drugs and vaccines, which will have to be researched and developed if they are to recover. If the pandemic does not stop, in a few decades it is anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 will become as safe as the four non-severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) currently circulating but causing low mortality in the human population. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Virus-host relationship system","coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; mortality; nonhuman; Note; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease resistance; genetic selection; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunity; immunology; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; virus replication; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; COVID-19 vaccine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; virus vaccine; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Resistance; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Selection, Genetic; Viral Vaccines; Virus Replication","32350571","Inflamm.

This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV‑2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, appropriate protective measures are necessary for both medical personnel and patients. In cases of corneal transplantation an infection of the donor tissue with SARS-CoV‑2 must be excluded. © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","ACE2 receptor; Cornea; COVID-19; Retina; TMPRSS2","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; eye infection; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Eye Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32583042","Ophthalmologe",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087078051

Although its etiologic agent is discovered as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are many unsolved issues in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The causes of different clinical phenotypes and incubation periods among individuals, species specificity, and cytokine storm with lymphopenia as well as the mechanism of damage to organ cells are unknown. It has been suggested that in viral pneumonia, virus itself is not a direct cause of acute lung injury; rather, aberrant immune reactions of the host to the insults from viral infection are responsible. According to its epidemiological and clinical characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 may be a virus with low virulence in nature that has adapted to the human species. Current immunological concepts have limited ability to explain such unsolved issues, and a presumed immu-nopathogenesis of COVID-19 is presented under the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis. Every disease, including COVID-19, has etiological substances controlled by the host immune system according to size and biochemical properties. Patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 show more severe hypercytokinemia with corresponding lympho-cytopenia than patients with mild pneumonia; thus, early immunomodulator treatment, including corticosteroids, has been considered. However, current guidelines recommend their use only for patients with advanced pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the immunopathogenesis of pneumonia may be the same for all patients regardless of age or severity and the critical immune-mediated lung injury may begin in the early stage of the disease, early immunomodulator treatment, including corticosteroids and intravenous immuno-globulin, can help reduce morbidity and possibly mortality rates of older patients with underlying conditions. © 2020 by The Korean Pediatric Society.","Corticosteroids; COVID-19; Intravenous immuno-globulin; Pathogenesis; Protein-homeosta-sis-system hypothesis","corticosteroid; high mobility group B1 protein; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; methylprednisolone; polypeptide antibiotic agent; protein S 100; RNA directed RNA polymerase; 2009 H1N1 influenza; adult respiratory distress syndrome; asymptomatic infection; bacterial flora; clinical feature; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug megadose; dysbiosis; hemorrhagic fever; herd immunity; Hong Kong influenza; human; immune response; immunopathogenesis; immunotherapy; incubation time; innate immunity; lung injury; lymphocytopenia; mortality rate; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; orchitis; pancreatitis; pyelonephritis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; rhabdomyolysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; taxonomy; virus load; virus pneumonia; virus replication; virus virulence",,"Korean J.

An increasing body of evidence has supported central nervous system involvement. Methods: We conducted a review of the reported data for studies concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines. Results: Central nervous system manifestations range from vague nonfocal complaints to severe neurological impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether the neurological dysfunction results from direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus could affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction, in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of the ongoing scientific and clinical findings.

The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across >205 nations, including the United States (US). Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally. Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors. While multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature. COVID-19 is predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence has showed that shedding in feces and feco-oral transmission could also be possible. It is unclear if COVID-19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids. GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions. This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission. Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non-urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent procedures based on the clinical need. Furthermore, pre-screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended. This article focuses on the risk of COVID-19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus, including transmission during endoscopies, and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non-urgent endoscopy procedures. © 2020 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society","coronavirus; COVID-19; endoscopy; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","alcohol; glutaraldehyde; hypochlorite sodium; body fluid; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disinfection; gastrointestinal endoscopy; hand washing; hospital management; human; intestine content; medical society; pathogenesis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; United States; viral contamination; virus shedding; virus transmission","32281689","Dig.

Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also involves multiple other organs, including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms, including virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and postinfectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID-19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system, COVID-19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain-Barre syndrome, and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID-19.

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Until 1st April 2020, the number of cases worldwide was recorded to be 823,626 with 40,598 deaths. Most of the reported cases were adults with few cases described in children and neonates. Objectives: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the disease characterisation in paediatric age group including the possibility of vertical transmission to the neonates. Methods: Articles published up to 2nd April 2020 in PubMed and google Scholar were considered for this study. Findings: The most frequently reported symptoms were cough 49% (95% CI: 42 – 55%) and fever 47% (95% CI: 41- 53%). Lymphopenia and increased Procalcitonin were recorded in (21%, 95% CI: 12 – 30%) and (28%, 95% CI: 18 – 37%) respectively. No sex difference for COVID-19 was found in paediatric age group (p = 0.7). Case fatality rate was 0%. Four out of 58 neonates (6.8%) born to COVID-19 confirmed mothers tested positive for the disease. Conclusion: The disease trajectory in Paediatric patients has good prognosis compared to adults. Intensive care unit and death are rare. Vertical transmission and virus shedding in breast milk are yet to be established. © 2020","COVID-19; Paediatrics; SARS-CoV-2; vertical transmission; Wuhan","aminotransferase; C reactive protein; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; lymphocyte surface marker; procalcitonin; breast feeding; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; dyspnea; fetus distress; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; human; laboratory diagnosis; leukocytosis; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; lymphocytosis; meta analysis; multiple organ failure; newborn; pandemic; pathogenesis; pneumonia; prematurity; prevalence; priority journal; Review; rhinorrhea; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; systematic review; vertical transmission; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; female; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; male; multicenter study; physiology; prognosis; vertical transmission; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis","32417675","J.

We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose-binding lectin). If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high-affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19 facilitates re-inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway’s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies (""viral auto-inhalation"" phenomenon). This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient. This “quantitative and time-/sequence-dependent” model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages. © 2020 The Authors.

The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from mild to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, many patients can be asymptomatic, thus increasing the uncertainty of the diagnostic work-up. Laboratory tests play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19, the current gold standard being real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens. However, the diagnostic accuracy of rRT-PCR depends on many pre-analytical and analytical variables. The measurement of specific COVID-19 antibodies (both IgG and IgM) should serve as an additional, non-invasive tool for disease detection and management. The imprecision of the MAGLUMI™ 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM and IgG assays (Snibe, Shenzhen, China) was assessed by adopting the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP15-A3 protocol. Linearity of dilution and recovery was evaluated by means of mixes of high-level pools and low-level pools of serum samples. Immunoglobulin time kinetics were evaluated using a series of serum samples, repeatedly collected from COVID-19-positive patients at different times, from <5 days up to 26-30 days. Findings at the analytical validation of the assay carried out according to the CLSI EP15-A3 guideline demonstrated that imprecision and repeatability were acceptable (repeatability was <4% and <6% for IgM and IgG, respectively, whilst intermediate imprecision was <6%). In addition, results of dilution and recovery studies were satisfactory. The kinetics of COVID-19 antibodies confirmed previously reported findings, showing a rapid increase of both IgM and IgG after 6-7 days from the symptom onset. IgG had 100% sensitivity on day 12, whilst 88% was the higher positive rate achieved for IgM after the same time interval. The findings of this study demonstrate the validity of the MAGLUMI 2000 Plus CLIA assay for the measurement of specific IgM and IgG in sera of COVID-19 patients, and for obtaining valuable data on the kinetics of both (IgM and IgG) COVID-19 antibodies. These data represent a pre-requisite for the appropriate utilization of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","analytical performances; antibody kinetics; COVID IgG and IgM; COVID-19; rRT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","gel; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; virus antibody; antibody specificity; blood sampling; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; kinetics; laboratory diagnosis; measurement repeatability; priority journal; Review; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral disease CLIA; Betacoronavirus; blood; China; Coronavirus infection; enzyme immunoassay; immunology; kinetics; laboratory technique; luminescence; pandemic; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Kinetics; Luminescent Measurements; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","32301749","Clin.

Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers. In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management. This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic. Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","biochemical monitoring; COVID-19; molecular testing; SARS-CoV-2; serology testing","biological marker; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; biological marker; antibody detection; biochemical analysis; cardiovascular disease; clinical laboratory; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; cross reaction; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; false negative result; hospital patient; human; immune response; kidney dysfunction; laboratory diagnosis; liver dysfunction; molecular diagnosis; nasopharynx; nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; patient care; patient monitoring; pediatrics; prevalence; priority journal; public health service; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; serodiagnosis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus load; virus neutralization; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; clinical laboratory service; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; laboratory; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Clinical Laboratory Services; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Laboratories; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensitivity and Specificity","32459192","Clin.

All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune-based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. Aim: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. Methods: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. Results: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. Conclusions: IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"6 mercaptopurine derivative; adalimumab; atazanavir; azathioprine; beclometasone; beta interferon; budesonide; chloroquine; corticosteroid; favipiravir; golimumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; influenza vaccine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; mercaptopurine; mesalazine; methotrexate; nitazoxanide; Pneumococcus vaccine; prednisolone; remdesivir; ribavirin; salazosulfapyridine; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor antibody; unindexed drug; ustekinumab; vedolizumab; abdominal pain; arthralgia; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease association; disease course; disease exacerbation; drug elimination; drug half life; dyspnea; hand washing; headache; human; infection prevention; infection risk; infection sensitivity; inflammatory bowel disease; influenza; interstitial pneumonia; isolation; malaise; medical decision making; medication compliance; myalgia; nucleic acid analysis; nutritional status; pandemic; patient care; patient compliance; pneumococcal infection; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoking cessation; social distance; systematic review; telemedicine; throat culture; unspecified side effect; virus transmission; vomiting","32348598","Aliment.

Materials and Methods: A non-systematic review in PubMed and the grey literature, as well as recommendations by a panel of stakeholders was made, regarding management, surgical considerations and follow-up of patients affected by lithiasis in the COVID-19 era. Results: Under the current outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic scenario, patients affected by lithiasis should be prioritized into low, intermediate and high risk categories, to decide their delay and save resources, healthcare personnel, beds and ventilators. However, patients with potentially serious septic complications need emergency interventions. The possibility of performing or restarting elective activity depends on local conditions, the availability of beds and ventilators, and the implementation of screening protocols in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delaying lithiasis surgery and increasing waiting lists will have consequences and will require considerable additional effort. Teleconsultation may be useful in guiding these patients, reducing visits and unnecessary exposure. Conclusions: categorization and prioritization of patients affected by lithiasis is crucial for management, surgical selection and follow-up.

Aim: This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. Methods: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6–2143 children infected with SARS-CoV‑2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. Results: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18–45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5–20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40–100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed. © 2020, Der/die Autor(en).","Acute respiratory tract infection; Coronavirus; Pediatric; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV‑2","adolescent; case fatality rate; child; China; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease severity; fever; Germany; hospitalization; hospitalized adolescent; hospitalized child; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; lower respiratory tract; nonhuman; pediatric hospital; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; upper respiratory tract infection",,"Monatsschr.

In children, allergy and asthma are among the most prevalent non-communicable chronic diseases, and healthcare providers taking care of these patients need guidance. At the current stage of knowledge, children have less severe symptoms of COVID-19, and severe asthma and immunodeficiency are classified as risk factors. In addition, there is no evidence that currently available asthma and allergy treatments, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators, increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19. Most countries affected by COVID-19 have opted for nationwide confinement, which means that communication with the primary clinician is often performed by telemedicine. Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic, and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines.

In addition, there are aspects specific to COVID-19 and gestation that should be known by specialists in order to correctly diagnose the disease, classify the severity, distinguish specific signs of COVID-19 from those of obstetric complications, and take the most appropriate management decisions. In this review we present in a highly concise manner an evidence-based protocol for the management of COVID-19 in pregnancy.

Reducing nosocomial infection is a new issue and challenge for all healthcare systems. Otolaryngology is a high-risk specialty as it close contact with upper respiratory tract mucous, secretions, droplets and aerosols during procedures and surgery. Therefore, infection prevention and control measures for this specialty are essential. Literatures on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and infection control measures of COVID-19 were reviewed, practical knowledge from first-line otolaryngologists in China, the United States, and Brazil were reviewed and collated. It was recommended that otolaryngology professionals should improve screening in suspected patients with relevant nasal and pharyngeal symptoms and signs, suspend non-emergency consultations and examinations in clinics, and rearrange the working procedures in operating rooms. The guidelines of personal protective equipment for swab sampling, endoscopy and surgery were listed. Indications for tracheotomy during the pandemic should be carefully considered to avoid unnecessary airway opening and aerosol-generation; precautions during surgery to reduce the risk of exposure and infection were illustrated.

The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose: This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results: Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions: Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai. © 2020, Indian Orthopaedics Association.","COVID-19; Guideline; Operative; Orthopaedics; Outpatient; SARS-CoV-2; Surgical procedures",,,"Indian J.

These conditions include thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications. Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

In the spring of 2003, an epidemic of coronavirus pneumonia spread from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and subsequently to the rest of the world. The WHO coined the acronym SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and subsequently the causative virus as SARS-CoV. In the summer of 2012, epidemic of pneumonia occurred again in Saudi Arabia which was subsequently found to be caused by another novel coronavirus. WHO coined the term MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) to denote the Middle East origin of the novel virus (MERS-CoV). In the winter of 2019, another outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China which rapidly spread globally. Yet another novel coronavirus was identified as the culprit and has been named SARS-CoV-2 due to its similarities with SARS-CoV, and the disease as coronavirus disease-2019. This overview aims to compare and contrast the similarities and differences of these three major episodes of coronavirus outbreak, and conclude that they are essentially the same viral respiratory syndromes caused by similar strains of coronavirus with different names. Coronaviruses have caused major epidemics and outbreaks worldwide in the last two decades. From an epidemiological perspective, they are remarkably similar in the mode of spread by droplets. Special focus is placed on the pediatric aspects, which carry less morbidity and mortality in all three entities. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19, MERS-CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome","child; childhood disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; epidemic; geographic distribution; history; human; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality rate; priority journal; Review; SARS coronavirus; seasonal variation; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; strain identification; summer; viral respiratory tract infection; virus strain; virus transmission; adolescent; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; female; history; infant; male; middle aged; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pandemic; pediatrics; preschool child; severe acute respiratory syndrome; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; History, 21st Century; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pediatrics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Young Adult","32483934","Pediatr.

One obvious question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks. Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include etiological diagnosis, patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance. Nonetheless, some structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of whom are with severe disease. Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","coronavirus; COVID-19; laboratory medicine; laboratory tests","coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic reasoning; disease surveillance; epidemic; human; laboratory test; managed care; nonhuman; patient care; patient monitoring; priority journal; Review; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32191623","Clin.

Data Sources: Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Review Methods: Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19. Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening. Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed. Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated. Results: Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19. Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence. Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively. Conclusions: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection. Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","ageusia; anosmia; coronavirus; COVID-19; gustatory; olfactory; SARS-CoV-2","anosmia; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; dysgeusia; hospital discharge; human; knowledge; meta analysis; olfactory nerve disease; prevalence; quality control; questionnaire; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; taste disorder; ageusia; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; global health; odor; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; smelling disorder; taste; virus pneumonia; Ageusia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Smell; Taste","32369429","Otolaryngol.

Political influences on outbreak preparedness, response and reporting may also adversely affect control of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Syria reported its first case on 22 March 2020; however, concerns were raised that this was delayed and that underreporting continues. Discussion: Syria's conflict has displaced more than half of its pre-war population, leaving 6.7 million people internally displaced. The consequent overcrowding – with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare (including laboratory capacity) – could lead to conditions that are ideal for spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria's borders, each with its own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation, with little interaction between them, could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity), leading to high deaths across the population, particularly for the most vulnerable such as detainees. Conclusions: Locally implementable interventions that rapidly build WASH and health system capacity are required across Syria to ensure early detection and management of COVID-19 cases. © 2020","Communicable diseases; Conflict; COVID-19; Preparedness; Syria","coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); death; disease surveillance; early diagnosis; early intervention; health care system; human; pandemic; politics; quarantine; resource allocation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Short Survey; Syrian Arab Republic; vulnerable population; war; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; Syrian Arab Republic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Syria","32389845","Int.

The outbreak started in China and spread rapidly to almost every country, culminating in woefully overwhelmed health-care systems in most countries. The only approved diagnostic test to accompany radiographic evaluation is reverse transcription PCR. However, the applicability of this test in diagnosis and surveillance is challenged by a global shortage of reagents and the lack of well-equipped laboratories with specialized staff in several low- and middle-income countries. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification and CRISPR-based diagnostic assays have developed and expected to play a role however, their accuracy is still inferior to the recommended PCR approach. The need for the development of accurate and rapid diagnostic assays became apparent. Immunodiagnostic tests and other molecular approaches were developed and tested. Other recently developed point-of-care molecular tests are expected to be helpful in pandemic management as no particular skills are required from the operator. Fortunately, a number of serological tests have been granted authorization for use under the emergency situation by the US FDA for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The majority of recently authorized serological tests detect IgG and IgM in blood of infected individuals by on ELISA, chemiluminescence platforms or lateral flow cassettes. © 2020 The Author(s)","Antigen; Coronavirus disease 2019; Isothermal amplification; Nasopharyngeal swab; Real-time RT-PCR; Serology","coronavirus spike glycoprotein; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 6; nucleocapsid protein; RNA directed RNA polymerase; virus envelope protein; virus RNA; aerosol; antigen antibody complex; antigen detection; asymptomatic infection; chemiluminescence immunoassay; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; CRISPR Cas system; cross reaction; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; humoral immunity; immunoaffinity chromatography; infection risk; laboratory diagnosis; loop mediated isothermal amplification; nucleotide sequence; pandemic; point of care testing; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; RNA extraction; sensitivity and specificity; sequence homology; seroconversion; serodiagnosis; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tracheobronchial toilet; virus load",,"New Microbes New Infect.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086731519

Nucleic-acid-based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection of COVID-19. However, the “gold standard” test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes several hours to complete and requires extensive human labor, materials such as RNA extraction kits that could become in short supply, and relatively scarce qPCR machines. It is clear that a huge effort needs to be made to scale up current COVID-19 testing by orders of magnitude. There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages. There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the “gold-standard” CDC RT-PCR test. Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles. Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own laboratories. We hope that this review can urgently consolidate and disseminate information to aid researchers in designing and implementing optimized COVID-19 testing protocols to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing. © 2020 Esbin et al.

Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues. This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with COVID-19 based on multi-institutional experiences. Methods We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the COVID-19 environment. Results Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer. Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment. Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter. Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure. Each COVID OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas. Conclusion Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with COVID-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Following an extensive literature search, we identified 24 eligible studies, including a total of 624 pediatric cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, which report data on 27 different biomarkers. We then performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence estimates (PPE) for these laboratory abnormalities in mild COVID-19. As data was too limited for children with severe COVID-19 to allow pooling, results were presented descriptively in a summary of findings table. Our data show an inconsistent pattern of change in the leukocyte index of mild and severe cases of COVID-19 in children. Specifically, changes in leukocyte counts were only observed in 32% of the mild pediatric cases (PPE: 13% increase, 19% decrease). In mild disease, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was frequently elevated, with a PPE of 33%. In severe disease, c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were frequently elevated. Based on data obtained from early COVID-19 studies, leukocyte indices in children appear inconsistent, differing from those reported in adults that highlight specific leukocyte trends. This brings into question the utility and reliability of such parameters in monitoring disease severity in the pediatric population. Instead, we suggest physicians to serially monitor CRP, PCT, and LDH to track the course of illness in hospitalized children. Finally, elevated CK-MB in mild pediatric COVID-19 cases is indicative of possible cardiac injury. This highlights the importance of monitoring cardiac biomarkers in hospitalized patients and the need for further investigation of markers such as cardiac troponin in future studies. © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists","Biomarkers; Clinical chemistry; Inflammation; Pediatrics; SARS-CoV-2","biological marker; C reactive protein; creatine kinase MB; lactate dehydrogenase; procalcitonin; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; blood; child; clinical chemistry; Coronavirus infection; female; hospitalization; human; infant; leukocyte count; male; meta analysis; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; severity of illness index; virology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Chemistry, Clinical; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Creatine Kinase, MB Form; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Leukocyte Count; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Procalcitonin; Severity of Illness Index","32473151","Clin.

Although most SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals manifest with a self-limited mild disease that resolves with supportive care in the outpatient setting, patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 will require a multidisciplinary collaborative management approach for optimal care in the hospital setting. Laboratory and radiologic studies provide critical information on disease severity, management options, and overall prognosis. Medical management is mostly supportive with antipyretics, hydration, oxygen supplementation, and other measures as dictated by clinical need. Among its medical complications is a characteristic proinflammatory cytokine storm often associated with end-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, liver and renal insufficiency, cardiac injury, and coagulopathy. Specific recommendations for the management of these medical complications are discussed. Despite the issuance of emergency use authorization for remdesivir, there are still no proven effective antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies, and their use in COVID-19 management should be guided by clinical trial protocols or treatment registries. The medical care of patients with COVID-19 extends beyond their hospitalization. Postdischarge follow-up and monitoring should be performed, preferably using telemedicine, until the patients have fully recovered from their illness and are released from home quarantine protocols. © 2020",,"anakinra; analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; antipyretic agent; chloroquine; corticosteroid; D dimer; favipiravir; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin G; lenzilumab; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; placebo; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; acute kidney failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; bacterial superinfection; blood clotting disorder; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; critical illness; cytokine storm; drug repositioning; dyspnea; hematological procedure; home monitoring; human; intensive care; isolation; kidney dysfunction; liver dysfunction; liver failure; mixed infection; polymerase chain reaction; respiratory failure; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; telemedicine; telemonitoring; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; hospitalization; pandemic; patient care; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Hospitalization; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Care Team; Pneumonia, Viral","32622450","Mayo Clin.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence surrounding the treatment of these patients during this pandemic and to provide evidence-based recommendations with attention to increased risk in this setting. Data Sources: A review of the literature was performed with PubMed. Because recently published articles on this topic may not yet be indexed into PubMed, otolaryngology journals were hand searched for relevant articles. Guidelines from national organizations were reviewed to identify additional relevant sources of information. Review Methods: Two groups of search terms were created: one with terms related to COVID-19 and another with terms related to head and neck cancer and its management. Searches were performed of all terms in each group as well as combinations of terms between groups. Searches and subsequent exclusion of articles were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Additional articles were identified after relevant journals and guidelines from national organizations were reviewed. Conclusions: Patients with head and neck mucosal malignancy require continued treatment despite the current pandemic state. Care must be taken at all stages of treatment to minimize the risk to patients and health care workers while maintaining focus on minimizing use of limited resources. Implications for Practice: Patient care plans should be guided by best available evidence to optimize outcomes while maintaining a safe environment in the setting of this pandemic. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","COVID-19; head and neck cancer; novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","cancer risk; cardiovascular disease; chemoradiotherapy; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; distress syndrome; dysphagia; evidence based medicine; fiber optics; free tissue graft; head and neck cancer; human; hypertension; hypoalbuminemia; immunosuppressive treatment; infection risk; intensive care unit; lymphedema; morbidity; mortality; mucosal cancer; otolaryngologist; pandemic; postoperative care; practice guideline; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quality of life; respiration control; Review; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sexual dysfunction; tracheotomy; United States; virus load; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; disease management; evidence based medicine; head and neck tumor; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Evidence-Based Medicine; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Otolaryngology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic","32340549","Otolaryngol.

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","coronavirus; COVID-19; diagnosis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)","analytical phase; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; disease course; human; laboratory diagnosis; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; pre-analytical phase; priority journal; public health; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; specimen handling; throat culture; virus genome; virus recombination; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; economics; epidemic; experimental error; laboratory technique; medical error; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Medical Errors; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Scientific Experimental Error; Specimen Handling","32172228","Clin.

Numerous studies have established the unique array of cytoprotective properties of the dietary amino acid ergothioneine. Based on studies in a range of in vitro and in vivo models, ergothioneine has exhibited the ability to modulate inflammation, scavenge free radicals, protect against acute respiratory distress syndrome, prevent endothelial dysfunction, protect against ischemia and reperfusion injury, protect against neuronal damage, counteract iron dysregulation, hinder lung and liver fibrosis, and mitigate damage to the lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and testis, amongst many others. When compiled, this evidence suggests that ergothioneine has a potential application in the treatment of the underlying pathology of COVID-19. We propose that ergothioneine could be used as a therapeutic to reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19, especially in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. This review presents evidence to support that proposal. © 2020 by the authors.

The observed symptoms, the cause of which remains unclear, included impaired consciousness, skeletal muscle injury and acute cerebrovascular disease, and appeared more frequently in severe disease. Since then, findings from several studies have hinted at various possible neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the historical association between neurological complications and highly pathological coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We draw from evidence derived from past coronavirus outbreaks, noting the similarities and differences between SARS and MERS, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

This disease became known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and was even more lethal than SARS. Currently, history has repeated itself with the emergence of a new Chinese epidemic at the end of 2019. For this respiratory disease, called COVID-19, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent.

Diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is suboptimal, and some procedural mistakes may account for it. Methods and results: The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner. Conclusions: We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions. Regards OPS, gentle anterior tongue depression should be used to avoid swab contamination from the oral cavity during collection of secretions from the posterior pharyngeal wall.

Patients with cancer represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in patients with cancer has been thwarted by the limited availability of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided RT, and such imaging frequently includes the chest. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the CBCT scans of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing image-guided RT for breast cancer who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCT scans were reviewed with diagnostic radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CT scans at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. Results: Five consecutive CBCT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the fourth and fifth CBCT scans in the 2 days before symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with scans obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT 3 days later showed improved pulmonary findings, and the patient resumed RT without incident. Conclusions: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended to identify such changes, with the hope that presymptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination. © 2020 The Author(s)",,"antineoplastic agent; adjuvant radiotherapy; asymptomatic infection; breast carcinoma; cancer hormone therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; case report; clinical article; cone beam computed tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; fatigue; female; fever; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer; hypofractionated radiotherapy; image guided radiotherapy; lumpectomy; mediastinum lymphadenopathy; priority journal; progesterone receptor positive breast cancer; radiodiagnosis; retrospective study; Review; sentinel lymph node biopsy; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia",,"Adv.

As of April 2020, the outbreak has spread to over 210 countries, with over 2,400,000 confirmed cases and over 170,000 deaths.1 COVID-19 causes a severe pneumonia characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath. Similar coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in the past causing severe pneumonia like COVID-19, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, over time, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to cause extrapulmonary signs and symptoms including hepatitis, acute renal failure, encephalitis, myositis and gastroenteritis. Similarly, sporadic reports of COVID-19 related extrapulmonary manifestations emerge. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive summary of the multiorgan manifestations of COVID-19, making it difficult for clinicians to quickly educate themselves about this highly contagious and deadly pathogen. What is more, is that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the closest humanity has come to combating something similar to COVID-19, however, there exists no comparison between the manifestations of any of these novel coronaviruses. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the manifestations of the novel coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, with a particular focus on the latter, and highlight their differences and similarities. © 2020 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation","COVID-19; Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Novel coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","antibiotic agent; corticosteroid; immunoglobulin; ribavirin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; fatality; gastrointestinal symptom; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; hematologic disease; hepatitis; histopathology; human; hypoxia; kidney disease; lymphocytopenia; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; myalgia; myocarditis; neurologic disease; nonhuman; pandemic; pregnancy disorder; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; skin manifestation; systematic review; thrombocytopenia; vertical transmission; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pandemic; pathophysiology; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32620220","Am.

Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive literature review has yet to be compiled. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes. CONCLUSION. This systematic review of current literature on COVID-19 provides insight into the initial and follow-up CT characteristics of the disease. © American Roentgen Ray Society.","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; COVID-19; CT scan; Influenza; Outbreak; Pneumonia; Radiology; Systematic review; Viral","adult respiratory distress syndrome; bronchiectasis; cause of death; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease course; follow up; heart septum defect; human; intensive care unit; lung cavitation; lymphadenopathy; patient transport; pericardial effusion; pleura effusion; pleura thickening; pneumothorax; population research; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vitreous opacity; Betacoronavirus; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; lung; pandemic; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32174129","Am.

Alarmingly, a high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 had isolated anosmia as the sole initial presenting symptom, which is likely due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and obstruction. Since isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for COVID-19, we wish to raise awareness on the association of anosmia with COVID-19, urging international and national health authorities to consider this association in their efforts for early detection and isolation of infected individuals and for breaking the chain of transmission. We urge our colleagues who assess patients with new-onset anosmia to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines to reduce the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","anosmia; COVID-19","anosmia; awareness; chronic rhinosinusitis; coronavirus disease 2019; dyspnea; geographic distribution; headache; human; hypogeusia; hyposmia; Iran; neurotropism; nose obstruction; Note; olfactory nerve; pandemic; practice guideline; risk factor; SARS coronavirus; virus load; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; mass screening; procedures; smelling disorder; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mass Screening; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32366195","Otolaryngol.

Early detection and containment are currently the most effective methods for controlling the outbreak. A positive diagnosis is determined by laboratory real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, but the use of chest computed tomography (CT) has also been indicated as an important tool for detection and management of the disease. Numerous studies reviewed in this paper largely concur in their findings that the early hallmarks of COVID-19 infection are ground-glass opacities (GGOs), often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution. In addition, most studies demonstrated similar CT findings related to the progression of the disease, starting with GGOs in early disease, followed by the development of crazy paving in middle stages and finally increasing consolidation in the later stages of the disease. Studies have reported a low rate of misdiagnosis by chest CT, as well as a high rate of misdiagnosis by the rRT-PCR tests. Specifically, chest CT provides more accurate results in the early stages of COVID-19, when it is critical to begin treatment as well as isolate the patient to avoid the spread of the virus. While rRT-PCR will probably remain the definitive final test for COVID-19, until it is more readily available and can consistently provide higher sensitivity, the use of chest CT for early stage detection has proven valuable in avoiding misdiagnosis as well as monitoring the progression of the disease. With the understanding of the role of chest CT, researchers are beginning to apply deep learning and other algorithms to differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT scans, determine the severity of the disease to guide the course of treatment, and investigate numerous additional COVID-19 applications. Impact statement: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been worldwide, and clinicians and researchers around the world have been working to develop effective and efficient methods for early detection as well as monitoring of the disease progression. This minireview compiles the various agency and expert recommendations, along with results from studies published in numerous countries, in an effort to facilitate the research in imaging technology development to benefit the detection and monitoring of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review paper on the topic, and it provides a brief, yet comprehensive analysis. © 2020 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","chest computed tomography; COVID-19; COVID-19 progression; COVID-19 severity","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; human; laboratory technique; lung; pandemic; reproducibility; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32588660","Exp.

As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans. In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly. Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions. The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms. It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential. Recently, cases of fecal–oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract. Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal symptoms; Pandemic","cytokine; cytokine; age; asymptomatic infection; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; disease transmission; fatality; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; hemoptysis; human; incubation time; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; multiple chronic conditions; myalgia; nausea; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; SARS coronavirus; sputum; symptomatology; United States; virus replication; virus shedding; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; digestive tract endoscopy; feces; immunology; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; viral tropism; virology; virus pneumonia; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Diarrhea; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Feces; Humans; Nausea; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Tropism; Virus Shedding; Vomiting","32447742","Dig.

Following World Health Organization (WHO) and health care authorities around the World recommendations, all elective surgeries from benign diagnose procedures must be postponed and imperatively continue working on emergent and oncological urgent pathologies. Surgical elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not considered as a priority. During BPH endoscopic surgeries, urine and blood are mixed with the irrigation liquid implying a risk of viral presence. Furthermore, a steam and smoke bubble is being accumulated inside the bladder implying the risk of splashing and aerosols. The risks of other viral infections have been identified during endourological procedures and they are related to splashing events. Several studies observed 33-100% of splashing on goggles. All BPH endoscopic procedures must be postponed. In case of complete urinary obstruction, this event can be adequately treated by urethral or suprapubic catheter under local anesthesia. As soon as local COVID-19 prevalence decreases, endourological procedures could be restarted. As protocols are being validating around the World to redeem elective surgeries, a symptomatic obstructed patient could be operated knowing his COVID-19 status with a molecular PCR, a cleaned epidemiological interview with a normal preoperative protocol. If patient is COVID-19+, surgery must be delayed until complete recovery, because mortality could increase as Lei from Wuhan describes. Informed consent must include risks of complications related to COVID-19 disease. Surgery must be performed by an experienced surgeon in order to avoid increase of operating time and risks of complications. Surgical approach of BPH must be considered depending on availability of disposable material, infrastructure, and the epidemiological COVID-19 status of your area. The main aim is patients and healthcare staff safety. © 2020, Brazilian Society of Urology.","COVID-19 [supplementary concept]; Pandemics; Prostatic hyperplasia","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; elective surgery; human; infection control; male; pandemic; procedures; prostate hypertrophy; protective equipment; urology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Urology","32550701","Int.

At the beginning of the outbreak, COVID-19 pneumonia was more common in adults than in children and adolescents, and the rate of confirmed pediatric cases was relatively lower. However, as screening tests and pathogen detection campaigns were initiated in more regions as the outbreak spread, the number of pediatric infection cases increased significantly. Currently, studies on pediatric COVID-19 are limited in the literature to case reports and case series, and a few epidemiological studies. COVID-19 has distinct characteristics in the pediatric population compared to adults; therefore, we need to better understand the characteristics of this disease in children. Discovering the characteristics of the pediatric COVID-19 disease is important for contributing to the diagnosis and treatment of the disease in this population.

Methods: Guidelines published by international and US governing bodies were reviewed in conjunction with published literature concerning COVID-19 transmission risk, testing, and PPE, to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers managing COVID-19 patients. Results: High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head and neck instrumentation and appropriate PPE during head and neck surgeries are lacking. However, extrapolation of recommendations by governing bodies suggests strongly that head and neck mucosal instrumentation warrants strict adherence to airborne-level precautions.

An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for disease treatment and control of the disease spread. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated a low sensibility; therefore chest computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role not only in the early detection and diagnosis, especially for false negative RT-PCR tests, but also in monitoring the clinical course and in evaluating the disease severity. This paper reports the CT findings with some hints on the temporal changes over the course of the disease: the CT hallmarks of COVID-19 are bilateral distribution of ground glass opacities with or without consolidation in the posterior and peripheral lung, but the predominant findings in later phases include consolidations, linear opacities, “crazy-paving” pattern, “reversed halo” sign and vascular enlargement. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of other diseases, in particular the viral pneumonia including influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, etc. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Method: We searched all relevant literature published up to February 28, 2020. Depending on the heterogeneity test, we used either random or fixed-effect models to analyze the appropriateness of the pooled results. Study has been registered in the PROSPERO database (ID 176106). Result: Overall 114 articles included in this study; 52 251 COVID-19 confirmed patients (20 studies), 10 037 SARS (51 studies), and 8139 MERS patients (43 studies) were included. The most common symptom was fever; COVID-19 (85.6%, P <.001), SARS (96%, P <.001), and MERS (74%, P <.001), respectively. Analysis showed that 84% of Covid-19 patients, 86% of SARS patients, and 74.7% of MERS patients had an abnormal chest X-ray. The mortality rate in COVID-19 (5.6%, P <.001) was lower than SARS (13%, P <.001) and MERS (35%, P <.001) between all confirmed patients. Conclusions: At the time of submission, the mortality rate in COVID-19 confirmed cases is lower than in SARS- and MERS-infected patients. Clinical outcomes and findings would be biased by reporting only confirmed cases, and this should be considered when interpreting the data. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","coronavirus; COVID-19; meta-analysis; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome","chill; clinical feature; clinical outcome; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; demography; diarrhea; dyspnea; fever; headache; human; laboratory; laboratory test; meta analysis; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality rate; nausea and vomiting; Review; rhinorrhea; risk factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sore throat; symptomatology; systematic review; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; blood cell count; China; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; female; hospitalization; lung; male; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; pandemic; pathophysiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; travel; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Blood Cell Count; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Dyspnea; Female; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Travel","32502331","Rev.

Without effective treatment and vaccination, the strategies to restrain this disease are only keeping social distance, maintaining personal hygiene, quarantine, and isolation. However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients. In addition to the high risk of cluster infection and compromised immunity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), an atypical disease presentation could also make the medial system neglect these patients during CVOID-19 pandemic. To avoid COVID-19 transmission among patients on dialysis, the major societies of nephrology around the world have provided their guidelines for screening, dialysis facilities adjustment, and health education, respectively. In this review, we summarized the main contents and differences of these guidelines and addressed the prompt management for patients with ESRD to reduce the risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.

Apart from the numerous chemicals, surgical smoke had been shown to harbour intact bacterial and virus particles especially COVID-19 in the current time. Objective: To identify the inhalational, infectious, chemical, and mutagenic risks of surgical smoke and suggest evidence-based hazard reduction strategies. Also to cogitate on the very high risk of viral spread by the use of surgical diathermy in COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A review of articles indexed for MEDLINE on PubMed using the keywords surgical smoke, diathermy, electrocautery, surgical smoke hazards, smoke evacuator, and guidelines for surgical smoke safety was performed. The review included evidences from 50 articles from the dermatology, surgery, infectious disease, obstetrics, and cancer biology literature. Results: There are risks associated with surgical smoke. Although some surgeons were aware, majority were not keen in the hazard reduction strategies. Conclusion: Many chemical and biological particles have been found in surgical smoke. It is highly recommended to follow the standardised guidelines for surgical smoke safety. Surgical smoke carries full virus particle(such as COVID-19 virus), it is strongly recommended to minimise or avoid electrocautery during the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2020 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation","COVID-19 outbreak; Electrocautery; Operating room hazards; Surgical diathermy; Surgical plume; Surgical smoke","chemical compound; cauterization; coronavirus disease 2019; diathermy; epidemic; hazard; human; infection; inhalation; mutagenicity; orthopedic surgeon; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; risk reduction; safety; surgical diathermy; surgical smoke; surgical technique",,"J.

Methods: We describe a small-team “cohorting” protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures. Results: A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between department members but providing comprehensive coverage. Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions. Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures. Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy.

We have termed the lung-restricted vascular immunopathology associated with COVID-19 as diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, which in its early stages is distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation. Increased circulating D-dimer concentrations (reflecting pulmonary vascular bed thrombosis with fibrinolysis) and elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations (reflecting emergent ventricular stress induced by pulmonary hypertension) in the face of normal fibrinogen and platelet levels are key early features of severe pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy related to COVID-19. Extensive immunothrombosis over a wide pulmonary vascular territory without confirmation of COVID-19 viraemia in early disease best explains the adverse impact of male sex, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

Material and Methods: We conducted a review of current literature related to surgical and clinical management of patients during COVID-19 crisis paying special attention to oncological ones and especially those suffering from PCa. Based on these publications and current urological guidelines, a manual to manage PCa patients is suggested. Results: Patients suffering from cancer are likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 disease together with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the management of oncological patients should be taken into special consideration and most of the treatments postponed. In case the procedure is not deferrable, it should be adapted to the current situation. While the shortest radiotherapy (RT) regimens should be applied, surgical procedures must undergo the following recommendations proposed by main surgical associations. PCa prognosis is generally favourable and therefore one can safely delay most of the biopsies up to 6 months without interfering with survival outcomes in the vast majority of cases. In the same way, most of the localised PCa patients are suitable for active surveillance (AS) or hormonal therapy until local definitive treatment could be reconsidered. In metastatic as well as castration resistant PCa stages, adding androgen receptor targeted agents (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) could be considered in high risk patients. On the contrary, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and Radium-223 must be avoided with regard to the consequence of hematologic toxicity and risk of COVID-19 infection because of immunodepression. Conclusions: Most of the biopsies should be delayed while AS is advised in those patients with low risk PCa. ADT allows us to defer definitive local treatment in many cases of intermediate and high risk PCa. In regard to metastatic and castration resistant PCa, combination therapies with abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide could be considered. Chemotherapy, Radium-223 and immunotherapy are discouraged. © 2020, Brazilian Society of Urology.","COVID-19 [supplementary concept]; Familial [supplementary concept]; GRADE approach; Pandemics; Prostate cancer","antiandrogen; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; male; pandemic; procedures; prostate tumor; urology; virus pneumonia; Androgen Antagonists; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prostatic Neoplasms; Urology","32549073","Int.

After the Spanish flu, now the world is in the grip of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First detected in 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite the initial evidence indicating a zoonotic origin, the contagion is now known to primarily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The precautionary measures recommended by the scientific community to halt the fast transmission of the disease failed to prevent this contagious disease from becoming a pandemic for a whole host of reasons. After an incubation period of about two days to two weeks, a spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in individuals afflicted by COVID-19: from an asymptomatic condition that can spread the virus in the environment, to a mild/moderate disease with cold/flu-like symptoms, to deteriorated conditions that need hospitalization and intensive care unit management, and then a fatal respiratory distress syndrome that becomes refractory to oxygenation. Several diagnostic modalities have been advocated and evaluated; however, in some cases, diagnosis is made on the clinical picture in order not to lose time. A consensus on what constitutes special treatment for COVID-19 has yet to emerge. Alongside conservative and supportive care, some potential drugs have been recommended and a considerable number of investigations are ongoing in this regard. © 2020, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

Although COVID-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The world is experiencing a major demographic shift toward an older, obese, and physically inactive populace. Risk factor assessments based on pandemic data indicate that those at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include older males, and people of all ages with obesity and related comorbidities such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Aging in and of itself leads to negative changes in innate and adaptive immunity, a process termed immunosenescence. Obesity causes systemic inflammation and adversely impacts immune function and host defense in a way that patterns immunosenescence. Two primary prevention strategies to reduce the risk for COVID-19 at both the community and individual levels include mitigation activities and the adoption of lifestyle practices consistent with good immune health. Animal and human studies support the idea that, in contrast to high exercise workloads, regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves immunosurveillance against pathogens and reduces morbidity and mortality from viral infection and respiratory illnesses including the common cold, pneumonia, and influenza. The odds are high that infectious disease pandemics spawned by novel pathogens will continue to inflict morbidity and mortality as the world's population becomes older and more obese. COVID-19 is indeed a wake-up call, a tocsin, to the world that primary prevention countermeasures focused on health behaviors and hygiene demand our full attention and support. © 2020","COVID-19; Exercise; Immunology; Infection; Obesity",,"32389882","J.

The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation within the alveolar space and prevention of normal gas exchange. The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung leads to recruitment of leukocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response. A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. COVID-19 patients show elevated D-dimers and fibrinogen. Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Tissue factor (TF) is exposed on damaged alveolar endothelial cells and on the surface of leukocytes promoting fibrin deposition, while significantly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from lung epithelium and endothelial cells create a hypofibrinolytic state. Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy. However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis. In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial. Nebulizer plasminogen activators may provide a targeted approach in COVID-19 patients to degrade fibrin and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients. © 2020 The Authors.

Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARSCoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR-0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ?3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ?2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into ""probably positive""and ""probably negative""cohorts. © 2020 Gietema et al.",,"adult; aged; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; CURB 65 score; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease course; emergency ward; female; high risk patient; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; Netherlands; prospective study; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; sepsis; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; virus virulence; Coronavirus infection; hospital emergency service; middle aged; pandemic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; statistical model; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","32645053","PLoS ONE",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087826039

Methods: Retrospective review. We introduce the negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce the risk of aerosol. NOVID consists of a plastic drape suspended above the patient's head and surgical field with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber. Results: Four patients underwent endonasal (4) and endo-oral surgery (1). Fluorescein was applied to the surgical field. Black light examination of fluorescein-treated operative fields revealed minimal contamination distant to the surgical field. In two prolonged cases with high-speed drilling, droplets were identified under the barrier and on the tip of the smoke evacuator. Instruments and cottonoids appeared to be a greater contributor to field contamination. Conclusions: Negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier, which appears to successfully keep aerosol and droplet contamination to a minimum. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","aerosolization; COVID-19; endoscopic surgery; negative-pressure; skull base","fluorescein; fluorescent dye; adenoid cystic carcinoma; aerosol; cancer surgery; Conference Paper; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; endoscopic endonasal surgery; human; hypophysis adenoma; infection risk; NK T cell lymphoma; oral surgery; osteomyelitis; otorhinolaryngology; priority journal; retrospective study; skull surgery; viral contamination; air pollutant; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; ear nose throat surgery; infection control; occupational exposure; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; surgical drape; ultraviolet radiation; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Fluorescein; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Occupational Exposure; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Surgical Drapes; Ultraviolet Rays","32358853","Head Neck",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084498727

Emerging predictors for poor outcomes include advanced age, male sex, preexisting cardiovascular disease, and risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and, more recently, obesity. This article posits new obesity-driven predictors of poor COVID-19 outcomes, over and above the more obvious extant risks associated with obesity, including cardiometabolic disease and hypoventilation syndrome in intensive care patients. This article also outlines a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in individuals with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread, with increased shedding, immune activation, and cytokine amplification. This paper proposes studies to test this reservoir concept with a focus on specific cytokine pathways that might be amplified in individuals with obesity and COVID-19. Finally, this paper underscores emerging therapeutic strategies that might benefit subsets of patients in which cytokine amplification is excessive and potentially fatal. © 2020 The Obesity Society.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chemokine; colony stimulating factor; cytokine; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; adipose tissue; cardiovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease severity; gene amplification; human; immunoreactivity; inflammation; intensive care; metabolic disorder; obesity; obesity hypoventilation syndrome; outcome assessment; predictor variable; protein expression; protein targeting; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; virus shedding; virus transmission; zoonosis; adipose tissue; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; obesity; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Adipose Tissue; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Lymphocyte Activation; Obesity; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32314868","Obesity",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084375199

Coronavirus disease 2019 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately 1 metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from coronavirus disease 2019 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care – contact, droplet or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol generating procedures. Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipment including use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment. © 2020 Association of Anaesthetists","airborne; contact; coronavirus; COVID-19; droplet; personal protective equipment","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; infection control; pandemic; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral","32246849","Anaesthesia",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083671231

Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus. By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays. By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays. Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses. Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response. However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive. Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals. This review aimed to summarise the current available information for diagnoses of cases and to aid laboratories and healthcare workers to select the best assays and procedures. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The detection and diagnosis have been improved, as well. However, the daily reported cases remaining at a high level make the epidemic trend prediction difficult. Methods: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemic's process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including the cumulative number of reported, deceased, quarantined and suspected cases. Results: Results show that the trend of the epidemic mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states, and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemic's peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while newly reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in the suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. Conclusions: The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemic is still uncertain, and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; Mathematical model; Multisource data; SEIR model","erratum","32689711","Int.

Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots.

The virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is transmitted by droplet infection from person to person. Our current understanding of the disease spectrum is limited. The proportion of infected children is significantly less compared to adults with the majority of them showing mild symptoms. More than half of symptomatic children present with fever and cough. However, the extent of asymptomatic infection in children and the role they play in community transmission is still undetermined. Although there are case reports of neonates infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, vertical transmission from infected mother to new-born is yet to be proven. The disease is confirmed by demonstration of the virus by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in respiratory secretions.

Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients. Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be slowly increased to the prior dosage level. © 2020",,"adult; anorexia nervosa; cognitive remediation therapy; controlled study; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; obsessive compulsive disorder; priority journal; psychotherapy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; Review; specialized attention therapy; treatment outcome; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; Asian continental ancestry group; Coronavirus infection; drug labeling; pandemic; pneumonia; psychiatry; schizophrenia; virus pneumonia; clozapine; neuroleptic agent; Antipsychotic Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Clozapine; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Labeling; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry; Schizophrenia","32289791","Psychother.

In this review, we discuss the most recent findings in terms of clinical features and the host immune response, and suggest candidate immune pathways that may be compromised in otherwise healthy individuals with fulminating COVID-19. On the basis of this early knowledge we reason a potential genetic effect on host immune response pathways leading to increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding these pathways may help not only in unraveling disease pathogenesis, but also in suggesting targets for therapy and prophylaxis.

Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 aim to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection. Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS-CoV-2 infection, or has previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys. Search methods: We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020. Selection criteria: We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria). Data collection and analysis: We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random-effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post-symptom onset. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results: We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in-house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints. We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability. Common issues were use of multi-group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID-19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47). Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants. Two-thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID-19 cases based on RT-PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false-negative RT-PCR results. We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5). We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post-symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time. Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week. The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% CI 21.4 to 40.7) for 1 to 7 days, 72.2% (95% CI 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% CI 87.0 to 94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False-positive results were more common where COVID-19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance. Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post-symptom onset. At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high-risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive. Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands. Authors' conclusions: The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT-PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS-CoV-2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies. Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease. The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests requires considerable improvement. Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms. COVID-19-positive cases who are RT-PCR-negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT-PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting.

Emerging in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the virus has spread rapidly around the world. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The most prominent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are respiratory. However, accumulating evidence highlights involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). This includes headache, anosmia, meningoencephalitis, acute ischemic stroke, and several presumably post/para-infectious syndromes and altered mental status not explained by respiratory etiologies. Interestingly, previous studies in animal models emphasized the neurotropism of coronaviruses; thus, these CNS manifestations of COVID-19 are not surprising. This minireview scans the literature regarding the involvement of the CNS in coronavirus infections in general, and in regard to the recent SARS-CoV-2, specifically. © Copyright © 2020 Khateb, Bosak and Muqary.","brain disorders; coronaviral infections; COVID-19; neurological & psychiatric symptoms; neurological infection and inflammation; SARS-CoV-2","acute necrotizing encephalopathy; anosmia; brain disease; brain ischemia; central nervous system disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; demyelination; disease association; encephalomyelitis; flaccid paralysis; human; meningoencephalitis; nonhuman; optic neuritis; Parkinson disease; respiration control; Review; risk factor",,"Front.

Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7)/Mas axis downregulation; increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease; thus, they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, it has been hypothesized that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld. © 2020","ACE inhibitor; angiotensin II receptor blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; COVID-19; mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; angiotensin[1-7]; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; losartan; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; mineralocorticoid antagonist; adult respiratory distress syndrome; biological model; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; human; nonhuman; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; pulmonary hypertension; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; upregulation; Betacoronavirus; cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; medication therapy management; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; virology; virus pneumonia; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Medication Therapy Management; Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Renin-Angiotensin System","32305401","J.

Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of ""nanoimmunity by design""can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when preparing for future pandemics. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Computational chemistry; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Disease control; Disinfection; Nanotechnology; Physicochemical properties; Viruses; Angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Chemical functionalization; Computational science; Engineered materials; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Nanoparticle (NPs); Therapeutic potentials; Vaccine development; Diseases; COVID-19 vaccine; cytokine; virus vaccine; Betacoronavirus; biomimetics; biosynthesis; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disinfection; drug delivery system; environmental microbiology; genetics; human; immunology; immunomodulation; mask; nanomedicine; nanotechnology; pandemic; photochemotherapy; procedures; protective equipment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomimetics; Computer Simulation; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disinfection; Drug Delivery Systems; Environmental Microbiology; Humans; Immunomodulation; Masks; Nanomedicine; Nanotechnology; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Photochemotherapy; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines","32519842","ACS Nano",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086863034

Despite their vital role in viral infection, the contribution of NK cells in fighting SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been directly investigated. Insights into pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities can therefore be inferred from studies assessing NK cell phenotype and function during SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. These studies suggest a reduction in circulating NK cell numbers and/or an exhausted phenotype following infection and hint toward the dampening of NK cell responses by coronaviruses. Reduced circulating NK cell levels and exhaustion may be directly responsible for the progression and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, in light of data linking inflammation with coronavirus disease severity, it is necessary to examine NK cell potential in mediating immunopathology. A common feature of coronavirus infections is that significant morbidity and mortality is associated with lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting from an exaggerated immune response, of which NK cells are an important component. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how NK cells respond in both early and late coronavirus infections, and the implication for ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials. Using this immunological lens, we outline recommendations for therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in clearing the virus while preventing the harm of immunopathological responses. © Copyright © 2020 Market, Angka, Martel, Bastin, Olanubi, Tennakoon, Boucher, Ng, Ardolino and Auer.","COVID-19; immunotherapy; innate immunity; interferon; NK cells","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; BCG vaccine; beta interferon; ciclesonide; emapalumab; gamma interferon; granzyme B; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; natural killer cell receptor NKG2A; pathogen associated molecular pattern; pattern recognition receptor; peginterferon lambda; pembrolizumab; recombinant alpha2b interferon; remdesivir; ribavirin; ritonavir; sarilumab; thymosin alpha1; tocilizumab; vitamin D; corticosteroid; cytokine; interferon; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; CD4+ T lymphocyte; chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cell immunotherapy; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine response; disease severity; hospital acquired pneumonia; host susceptibility; human; immunological memory; immunomodulation; immunopathology; immunotherapy; innate immunity; natural killer cell; nonhuman; Review; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral clearance; virus entry; adoptive transfer; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; mortality; mouse; natural killer cell; pandemic; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adoptive Transfer; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Ascorbic Acid; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunologic Memory; Interferon Type I; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32655581","Front.

Its etiological agent is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe pneumonia accompanied by multisystemic failure that can lead to a patient's death. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is known to involve all the components of the immune system that together appear responsible for viral elimination and recovery from the infection. Nonetheless, such immune responses are implicated in the disease's progression to a more severe and lethal process. This review describes the general aspects of both COVID-19 and its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, stressing the similarities with other severe coronavirus infections, such as SARS and MERS, but more importantly, pointing toward the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is a consequence of the corresponding variable spectrum of the immune responses to the virus. The critical point where progression of the disease ensues appears to center on loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses due to exacerbation of the inflammatory components. Finally, it appears possible to delineate certain major challenges deserving of exhaustive investigation to further understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, thus helping to design more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic strategies. © Copyright © 2020 García.","antibodies; COVID-19; cytokines; immune response; inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; spectrum; T cells","chemokine receptor CCR5; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 33; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; lactate dehydrogenase; myeloperoxidase; neutralizing antibody; programmed death 1 ligand 1; protein p53; secretory immunoglobulin; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 7; transcriptome; tumor necrosis factor; virus antigen; cytokine; secretory immunoglobulin; virus antibody; adaptive immunity; amino acid sequence; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; apoptosis; asymptomatic infection; bioinformatics; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; cancer immunotherapy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; chronic rhinosinusitis; complement activation; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; cytokine release syndrome; dengue; disease exacerbation; disseminated intravascular clotting; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fibrosing alveolitis; follow up; gene expression; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; immune response; immunogenicity; immunoregulation; inflammation; innate immunity; lung alveolus epithelium cell; lung lavage; lymphocytopenia; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mononuclear phagocyte; natural killer cell; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; peripheral occlusive artery disease; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; risk factor; SARS coronavirus; septic shock; seroprevalence; signal transduction; simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; tumor immunity; viral clearance; viremia; virus detection; virus replication; virus transmission; virus virulence; age; Betacoronavirus; blood; classification; Coronavirus infection; genetics; immunology; inflammation; macrophage; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Antibodies, Viral; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Immunoglobulin A, Secretory; Inflammation; Macrophages; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; T-Lymphocytes","32612615","Front.

This brief expert review grounds on available subject-relevant literature searched until May 14, 2020, including Medline, Google Scholar, and preprint servers. We delineate in brief sections, each introduced by a summary of respective COVID-19 references, how EPO may target a number of the gravest sequelae of these patients. EPO is expected to: (1) improve respiration at several levels including lung, brainstem, spinal cord and respiratory muscles; (2) counteract overshooting inflammation caused by cytokine storm/ inflammasome; (3) act neuroprotective and neuroregenerative in brain and peripheral nervous system. Based on this accumulating experimental and clinical evidence, we finally provide the research design for a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial including severely affected patients, which is planned to start shortly. © 2020 The Author(s).","clinical trial design; cytokine storm; EPO; inflammation; neuroprotection; respiratory function; SARS-CoV-2; recombinant human erythropoietin","inflammasome; recombinant erythropoietin; EPO protein, human; erythropoietin; neuroprotective agent; recombinant protein; respiratory tract agent; breathing; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; evidence based medicine; health care planning; human; nerve regeneration; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory function; Review; treatment indication; treatment outcome; Betacoronavirus; brain stem; breathing muscle; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; double blind procedure; drug effect; immunology; lung; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; phrenic nerve; proof of concept; randomized controlled trial (topic); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severity of illness index; spinal cord; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Brain Stem; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Double-Blind Method; Erythropoietin; Humans; Lung; Neuroprotective Agents; Pandemics; Phrenic Nerve; Pneumonia, Viral; Proof of Concept Study; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Proteins; Respiratory Muscles; Respiratory System Agents; Severity of Illness Index; Spinal Cord","32546125","Mol.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a respiratory illness with symptoms such as dry cough, fever, sudden loss of smell, and, in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. To date, there is no specific vaccine or treatment proven effective against this viral disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is thus critical to curbing its spread and improving health outcomes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly used to detect the presence of COVID-19. Other techniques, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and microfluidics, have allowed better disease diagnosis. Here, as part of the effort to expand screening capacity, we review advances and challenges in the rapid detection of COVID-19 by targeting nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies. We also summarize potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 and discuss ongoing clinical trials of interventions to reduce viral progression. Copyright © 2020 Zichao Luo et al.

The first positive case in Switzerland was confirmed on 25 February 2020 in a patient from canton Tessin, who most likely caught the virus during a visit to Milan, Italy [2]. The country has since been preparing for an imminent public health emergency caused by the pandemic. As of 14 May 2020, the Swiss healthcare system is facing a total of 30,463 corona virus-positive people [3]. With numbers of new infections decreasing after the first pandemic wave, the continuing endemic situation will continue to be a major challenge for the Swiss healthcare system. It remains crucial to separate the clinically low-symptomatic from the severely affected patients in order to offer a specific therapeutic strategy to every SARS-CoV-2 patient. Reports from Chinese cohorts describe an increasing role of imaging strategies in the detection and surveillance of COVID-19 patients because of insufficient testing sensitivity of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests [4]. Chest computed tomography (CT), with a reported sensitivity of up to 97% [5, 6], gained importance particularly in patients with false negative RT-PCR results. In this short communication, we describe our first clinical experiences with 55 COVID-19 patients in Central Switzerland, who were either imaged with a standard chest x-ray, chest CT, or both. We provide an illustrative and schematic description of typical COVID-19 imaging features and suggest that imaging plays an important role in the clinical work-up of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

While fever, cough, and respiratory distress are typical first symptoms, a fraction of those affected present instead with neurological symptoms suggestive of central nervous system compromise. This review summarizes the potential contribution of coronavirus disease 2019 to hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly and proposes possible mechanisms. Reports show that the most affected patients have underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are two key risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the main host cell surface receptor interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein to allow viral entry and infection. We speculate that ensuing downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression may compound the risk conferred by pre-existing comorbidities and critically influence the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke by elevating blood pressure and impairing cerebrovascular endothelial function. Additionally, both age- and/or disease-related immune dysfunction and enhanced catecholamine release secondary to anxiety and stress may also aggravate central nervous system symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Thus, assessment of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and tight control of hemodynamic parameters upon admission are crucial to minimize mortality and morbidity in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with central nervous system symptoms suggestive of incipient stroke. © 2020 Wang et al.","ACE2; COVID-19; Hemorrhagic stroke; Immunity; SARS-CoV-2","aged; animal; brain hemorrhage; cerebrovascular accident; complication; Coronavirus infection; human; immunology; pandemic; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Aged; Animals; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Stroke","32527987","Aging",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087095433

Methods: MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: “COVID 19” OR “coronavirus” AND “brain” OR “CNS” OR “neurologic”. Results: Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general. Conclusion: While neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CNS; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Neurological; Seizure","central nervous system disease; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; cerebrovascular disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; electroencephalography; human; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32299017","J.

In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians, to the sale of face masks which may not necessarily protect the wearer.

Plans and policies for responding to public health emergencies are generally framed at higher levels of governance, but developing, improving and sustaining the capacities necessary for implementing these policies is a direct function of local-level authorities. Evaluating local-level public health capacities is an important process for identifying strengths and weaknesses that can impact the preparedness for, detection of and response to health security threats. However, while various evaluations and assessments exist for evaluating capacities at other levels, currently, there are no readily available health security assessments for the local-level. In this paper, we describe a tool-the Rapid Urban Health Security Assessment (RUHSA) Tool-that is based on a variety of other relevant assessments and guidance documents. Assessing capacities allow for local-level authorities to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their local health security systems, create multiyear action plans and prioritise opportunities for improving capacities, effectively engage with development partners to target resources effectively and develop compelling narratives and a legacy of leadership. While the RUHSA Tool was not designed to be used in the midst of a public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it may also be adapted to inform a checklist for prioritising what capacities and activities a city needs to rapidly develop or to help focus requests for assistance. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Indeed, patients with T2DM show high prevalence, severity of disease and mortality during Covid-19 infection. However, the rates of severe disease are significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared with non-diabetes (34.6% vs. 14.2%; p < 0.001). Similarly, T2DM patients have higher rates of need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU, 37.0% vs. 26.7%; p = 0.028). Thus, about the pneumonia of Covid-19, we might speculate that the complicated alveolar-capillary network of lungs could be targeted by T2DM micro-vascular damage. Therefore, T2DM patients frequently report respiratory symptoms and are at increased risk of several pulmonary diseases. In addition, pro-inflammatory pathways as that involving interleukin 6 (IL-6), could be a severity predictor of lung diseases. Therefore, it looks intuitive to speculate that this condition could explain the growing trend of cases, hospitalization and mortality for patients with T2DM during Covid-19 infection. To date, an ongoing experimental therapy with monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor in Italy seems to have beneficial effects on severe lung disease and prognosis in patients with Covid-19 infection. Therefore, should patients with T2DM be treated with more attention to glycemic control and monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor during the Covid-19 infection? © 2020 The Author(s).","Covid-19; Micro-vascular disease; Several disease; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","insulin; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; tocilizumab; IL6R protein, human; interleukin 6 receptor; monoclonal antibody; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cytokine storm; disease association; glycemic control; human; hypercoagulability; inflammation; insulin resistance; lung capillary; microangiopathy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathogenesis; prognosis; repeated drug dose; Review; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; blood; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; glucose blood level; glycemic index; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pandemic; physiology; treatment outcome; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Blood Glucose; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycemic Index; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Interleukin-6; Treatment Outcome","32527257","Cardiovasc.

As a result, the public health and clinical community are hindered in their ability to monitor and contain the spread of COVID-19. Despite broad consensus that more testing is needed, pragmatic guidance toward realizing this objective has been limited. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a novel and geographically agnostic framework (the 4Ps framework) to guide multidisciplinary, scalable, resource-efficient, and achievable efforts toward enhanced testing capacity. The 4Ps (Prioritize, Propagate, Partition, and Provide) are described in terms of specific opportunities to enhance the volume, diversity, characterization, and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 testing to benefit public health. Coordinated deployment of the strategic and tactical recommendations described in this framework has the potential to rapidly expand available testing capacity, improve public health decision-making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or to be applied in future emergent disease outbreaks. © 2020 The Authors.

However, widespread gaps in the quality of primary health care still exist. In this Review, we aim to identify the causes for this poor quality, and provide policy recommendations. System challenges include: the suboptimal education and training of primary health-care practitioners, a fee-for-service payment system that incentivises testing and treatments over prevention, fragmentation of clinical care and public health service, and insufficient continuity of care throughout the entire health-care system. The following recommendations merit consideration: (1) enhancement of the quality of training for primary health-care physicians, (2) establishment of performance accountability to incentivise high-quality and high-value care; (3) integration of clinical care with the basic public health services, and (4) strengthening of the coordination between primary health-care institutions and hospitals. Additionally, China should consider modernising its primary health-care system through the establishment of a learning health system built on digital data and innovative technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"antibiotic agent; China; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; drug use; general practitioner; health care personnel; health care quality; health workforce; human; hypertension; income; integrated health care system; medical education; medical fee; medical information system; patient care; prescription; primary health care; priority journal; public health service; remuneration; Review; Coronavirus infection; education; organization and management; pandemic; primary health care; virus pneumonia; China; Continuity of Patient Care; Coronavirus Infections; Fee-for-Service Plans; Humans; Pandemics; Physicians, Primary Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Primary Health Care; Quality of Health Care","32505251","Lancet",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085749433

This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies. © Copyright © 2020 He, Wang, Li and Shi.","ACE2; COVID-19; microbiota; SARS-CoV-2; SCFAs","amino acid transporter; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; interferon; polypeptide antibiotic agent; programmed death 1 ligand 1; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral therapy; artificial ventilation; bacteriotherapy; Bacteroides; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; down regulation; Enterobacteriaceae; gene expression; genetic distance; genetic variability; high throughput sequencing; human; immunopathology; incubation time; intestine absorption; intestine flora; Lachnospiraceae; microbial community; microflora; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mTOR signaling; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; regulatory T lymphocyte; respiratory distress; Review; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single nucleotide polymorphism; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; thorax radiography; virus transmission",,"Front.

Whether rich or poor, all nations are struggling to cope with this new global health crisis. The speed of the threat's emergence and the quick response required from public health authorities and the public itself makes evident the need for a major reform in pandemic surveillance and notification systems. The development and implementation of a graded, individual-level pandemic notification system could be an effective tool to combat future threats of epidemics. This paper describes a prototype model of such a notification system and its potential advantages and challenges for implementation. Similar to other emergency alerts, this system would include a number of threat levels (level 1-5) with a higher level indicating increasing severity and intensity of safety measures (eg, level 1: general hygiene, level 2: enhanced hygiene, level 3: physical distancing, level 4: shelter in place, and level 5: lockdown). The notifications would be transmitted to cellular devices via text message (for lower threat levels) or push notification (for higher threat levels). The notification system would allow the public to be informed about the threat level in real time and act accordingly in an organized manner. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have recently launched similar alert systems designed to coordinate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response more efficiently. Implementing such a system, however, faces multiple challenges. Extensive preparation and coordination among all levels of government and relevant sectors are required. Additionally, such systems may be effective primarily in countries where there exists at least moderate trust in government. Advance and ongoing public education about the nature of the system and its steps would be an essential part of the system, such that all members of the public understand the meaning of each step in advance, similar to what has been established in systems for other emergency responses. This educational component is of utmost importance to minimize adverse public reaction and unintended consequences. The use of mass media and local communities could be considered where mobile phone penetration is low. The implementation of such a notification system would be more challenging in developing countries for several reasons, including inadequate technology, limited use of data plans, high population density, poverty, mistrust in government, and tendency to ignore or failure to understand the warning messages. Despite the challenges, an individual-level pandemic notification system could provide added benefits by giving an additional route for notification that would be complementary to existing platforms. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Like in all other infectious diseases, the host immune system plays a key role in our defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, viruses are able to evade the immune attack and proliferate and, in susceptible individuals, cause severe inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, particularly in the lungs. The advancement in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the host immune responses promises to facilitate the development of approaches for prevention or treatment of diseases. Components of immune system, such as antibodies, can also be used to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic methods as well as novel therapeutic agents. In this review, we summarize our knowledge about how the host mounts immune responses to infection by SARS-CoV-2.

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 worldwide, highlights the critical need for developing rapid and accurate diagnostic testing methods for emerging human coronavirus (CoV) infections. Testing is crucial to track the spread of disease during a pandemic, and to swiftly permit public health interventions including isolation, quarantine, and appropriate clinical management of afflicted individuals. The key components of viral diagnostic tests are (1) collection of the appropriate sample (blood, nasal swab, and throat swab), (2) availability of the genetic and proteomic sequences of the novel virus for analysis, and (3) rapid and accurate laboratory testing methods. The current gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viral nucleic acids. Other relevant laboratory methods include enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIA) for viral antibody and antigen detection, and serum viral neutralization (SVN) assays for antibody neutralization determination. The challenges faced in developing a diagnostic test for a novel pathogen are the ability to measure low viral loads for early detection, to provide low or no cross-reactivity with other viral strains and to deliver results rapidly. Several point-of-care molecular devices are currently being integrated for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This review discusses the current laboratory methods available to test for coronaviruses by focusing on the present COVID-19 outbreak. © Copyright © 2020 D'Cruz, Currier and Sampson.","convalescent plasma; coronavirus; EIA; lateral flow diagnostics; RT-PCR","antibody detection; biosafety; Cas13a Assay; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme immunoassay; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; high throughput sequencing; human; immunoassay; laboratory test; lateral flow immunoassay; nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; recombinase polymerase amplification; reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus detection; virus neutralization",,"Front.

Otolaryngologists and supporting health care workers (HCWs) are particularly at high risk of becoming infected while treating patients as many in-office procedures and surgeries are Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP). Based on a review of the literature and various guidelines, recommendations are made to mitigate the risk to health care workers of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while providing clinical care. Recommendations: During the COVID-19 pandemic all elective and non-time sensitive Otolaryngology procedures should be deferred to mitigate the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs. For non-AGMPs in all patients, even COVID-19 positive patients Level 1 PPE (surgical mask, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles) is sufficient. If local prevalence is favourable and patients are asymptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, Level 1 PPE can be used during short duration AGMPs, with limited risk of infected aerosol spread. For AGMPs in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a minimum of Level 2 PPE, with adequate protection of mucosal surfaces, is recommended (N95/FFP2 respirator, gown, double gloves, goggles or face shield and head cover). For long duration AGMPs that are deemed high-risk in COVID-19 positive patients, Level 3 PPE can provide a higher level of protection and be more comfortable during long duration surgeries if surgical hoods or PAPRs are used. It is recommended that these procedures are performed in negative pressure rooms, if available. It is essential to follow strict donning and doffing protocols to minimize the risk of contamination. Conclusions: By following strict infection prevention recommendations, the risk of HCWs becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients can be minimized. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly, these recommendations should serve as guidance and need to be interpreted based on local factors and availability of healthcare resources. © 2020 The Author(s).","Aerosol; COVID-19; Guideline; Pandemic; PAPR; PPE; Respirator; Review","aerosol; asymptomatic disease; clinical protocol; coronavirus disease 2019; eye protection; health care availability; health care personnel; high risk patient; human; intermediate risk patient; low risk patient; medical procedures; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; adverse event; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; ear nose throat disease; ear nose throat surgery; health care personnel; infection control; organization and management; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; practice guideline; prevention and control; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Otolaryngology; Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Protective Devices","32493489","J.

The invasion of the main pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), into human body causes different levels of impact to various patients. One of the most important issues for COVID-19 is how to defend this virus with the ability to foresee the infected targets. Thus, we maintain the quarantined essentially as for as others saved from COVID-19. So far, the routine laboratory test to confirm whether infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV or not is through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR; quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) with certain sequence regions that recognize SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV RNA genome. The heavy loading of rRT-PCR (qPCR) machine and handling labor have tight-packed the instruments as well as the manpower almost in every country. Therefore, the alternative approaches are eagerly waiting to be developed.

Methods: From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. Results: Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools. © 2020","COVID-19; Fecal shedding; Pediatric patient; SARS-CoV-2","interferon; ribavirin; virus RNA; abdominal pain; child; China; Chinese medicine; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; feces; female; fever; follow up; human; laboratory test; male; nucleic acid analysis; pediatric patient; preschool child; radiological parameters; respiratory system; Review; rhinorrhea; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; viral clearance; virus shedding; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; feces; gastrointestinal tract; infant; isolation and purification; pandemic; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; virus shedding; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Infant; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory System; RNA, Viral; Virus Shedding","32276848","J.

Governments in different countries have taken drastic actions such as complete lockdown. However, little attention has been paid to food safety and its potential linkage with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spread from staff to food products or food surfaces is conceivable. At least, instead of consuming unpackaged or uncovered foods, consumption of boiled or canned foods processed at high temperatures should be preferred. Before consumption, consumers should clean the surface of canned foods. In addition to recommending or enforcing simple precautions, such as using masks, governments must conduct mandatory SARS-CoV-2 tests regularly and intermittently for personnel who handle food materials or supporting materials (e.g., plastic pouches). Local markets, such as those in Wuhan, which sell live animals and exotic foods for consumption, are a concern. Trade of exotic or wild animals, unhygienic marketplace conditions, and not cooking at high temperatures ought to be prohibited. The consumption of vitamins, minerals, and other food-derived compounds such as omega fatty acids is a prudent way to improve the performance of the immune system.

This would facilitate an appropriate treatment, a prompt isolation and consequently deceleration of the pandemic. Various laboratory tests can identify the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 in specimens, or specific anti-viral antibodies in blood/serum. Due to the current pandemic situation, a development of point-of-care diagnostics (POCD) allows us to substantially accelerate taking clinical decisions and implement strategic planning at the national level of preventative measures. This review summarizes and compares the available POCD and those currently under development, including quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), serology immunoassays (SIAs) and protein microarray method (PMM) designed for standard and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; In vitro diagnostic tests; RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; Serology immunoassays","RNA; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; exhaled breath condensate; human; immunoassay; immunoenzymatic assay; immunofluorimetric assay; laboratory diagnosis; lateral flow immunoassay; point of care testing; protein microarray; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; serodiagnosis; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"Diagn.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087979824

The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for MEDLINE included ‘clinical’, ‘faeces’, ‘gastrointestinal secretions’, ‘stool’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’ and ‘2019-nCoV’. Additional searches were done in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the World Health Organization Database, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, social media and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results: Twenty-six relevant articles were identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. The duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. Conclusion: There is a high rate of positive polymerase chain reaction tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract. © 2020 The Authors.

SARS-CoV-2 transmits mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic diseases are high-risk population. People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission.

A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guideline recommendations, searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Studies’ quality assessments were performed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. A total of 37 studies were included, involving 275 pregnant women with COVID‐19 and 248 neonates. The majority of pregnant women presented with mild to moderate symptoms, only 10 were admitted in the ICU, and one died. Two stillbirths were reported and the incidence of prematurity was 28%. Sixteen neonates were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by RT‐PCR, and nine of them were born from mothers infected during pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes were generally good: all the affected neonates recovered. RT‐PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 yielded negative results on amniotic fluid, vaginal/cervical fluids, placenta tissue, and breast milk samples. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in pregnant women appeared associated with mild or moderate disease in most cases, with a low morbidity and mortality rate. The outcomes of neonates born from infected women were mainly favorable, although neonates at risk should be closely monitored.

I explored the putative causes of this specific feature through a detailed genomic comparison with the closest SARS-CoV-2 relatives isolated from bats, as well as previous coronavirus strains responsible for the previous epidemics (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). The high variability region of the nsp3 protein was confirmed to exhibit the most variations between closest strains. It was then studied in the context of physiological and molecular data available in the literature. A number of convergent findings suggest de-mono-ADP-ribosylation (de-MARylation) of STAT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 as a putative cause of the cytokine storm observed in the most severe cases of COVID-19.

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a huge impact on dermatological practice including the marked reduction of face-to-face consultations in favour of teledermatology, the uncertainties concerning the outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with common inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis receiving immunosuppressive/immunomodulating systemic therapies; the direct involvement of dermatologists in COVID-19 care for patient assistance and new research needs to be addressed. It is not known yet if skin lesions and derangement of the skin barrier could make it easier for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit via indirect contact; it remains to be defined if specific mucosal or skin lesions are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although some unpublished observations indicate the occurrence of a transient varicelliform exanthema during the early phase of the infection.

Appropriate measures are required to keep laboratory staff safe while producing reliable test results. In the analytic stage, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. In the postanalytical stage, testing results should be carefully interpreted using both molecular and serological findings.

Though the virus is considered as a novel entity, it is not a completely new member. It is just a new version of previously emerged human SARS corona virus. The rapid evolving nature by changing host body environment and extreme environmental stability, collectively makes SARS-CoV-2 into an extremely virulent genetic variant. The evolution of the virus has been occurred by the continuous process of molecular genetic manipulation, through mutation, deletion and genetic recombinationevents. Different host body environment acts as the supportive system for the pathogen which creates extreme selective pressure. By the process of genetic evolution the pathogen developes new characters. Then the new version of the virus has been naturally selected by susceptible human host and adapt itself inside the host body causing deadly effect. Moreover, extreme environmental stability helps in the process of viral survival outside the host and its transmission.

Methods: A PubMed/MEDLINE database review of articles was performed querying topical preparations with virucidal activity against coronaviruses. Results: Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solutions ranging from 0.23% to 7% have been found to demonstrate highly effective virucidal activity against a broad range of viruses including several coronaviruses responsible for recent epidemics including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Conclusions: While specific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 is lacking, PVP-I-based preparations have been successfully demonstrated to reduce viral loads of coronaviruses.

The pathogenic particles that are generated by coughing and sneezing remain suspended in the air or attach to a surface to facilitate transmission in an aerosol form. This review focuses on the recent trends in pandemic biology, diagnostics methods, prevention tools, and policies for COVID-19 management. To meet the growing demand for medical supplies during the COVID-19 era, a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators have been developed using do-it-yourself (DIY) manufacturing. COVID-19 diagnosis and the prediction of virus transmission are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, simulations, and digital monitoring. Until the discovery of a clinically approved vaccine for COVID-19, pandemics remain a public concern.

We herewith report the proof-of-concept development of a biosensor able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus. The biosensor is based on membrane-engineered mammalian cells bearing the human chimeric spike S1 antibody. We demonstrate that the attachment of the protein to the membrane-bound antibodies resulted in a selective and considerable change in the cellular bioelectric properties measured by means of a Bioelectric Recognition Assay. The novel biosensor provided results in an ultra-rapid manner (3 min), with a detection limit of 1 fg/mL and a semi-linear range of response between 10 fg and 1 µg/mL. In addition, no cross-reactivity was observed against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the biosensor was configured as a ready-to-use platform, including a portable read-out device operated via smartphone/tablet. In this way, we demonstrate that the novel biosensor can be potentially applied for the mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 surface antigens without prior sample processing, therefore offering a possible solution for the timely monitoring and eventual control of the global coronavirus pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it. © 2020 by the authors.

Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors.

Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infectious disease; MERS; Pneumonia; Public health; SARS; SARS-COV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; adult respiratory distress syndrome; basic reproduction number; binding affinity; case fatality rate; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease surveillance; dyspnea; fever; flu like syndrome; gene sequence; hospitalization; human; hygiene; incubation time; intensive care unit; malaise; Middle East respiratory syndrome; myalgia; nasopharyngeal aspiration; prevalence; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory distress; Review; risk assessment; sepsis; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus load; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; zoonosis",,"Infect.

Though major symptoms are primarily generated from the respiratory system, neurological symptoms are being reported in some of the confirmed cases, raising concerns of its potential for intracranial invasion and neurological manifestations, both in the acute phase and in the long-term. At present, it remains unclear the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 is present in the brain, and if so, its pathogenic role in the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence for neuroinvasion and neurovirulence of hCoVs has been recognised in animal and human studies. Given that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family and shares characteristics in terms of receptor binding properties, it is worthwhile exploring its potential CNS manifestations. This review summarises previous findings from hCoVs in relation to the CNS, and compares these with the new strain, aiming to provide a better understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS. © 2020 The Author(s)","Brain; Coronavirus; Human; Neuroinvasion; Neurological manifestation; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; microsomal aminopeptidase; peptides and proteins; transmembrane protease serine 2; unclassified drug; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; viral protein; acute respiratory tract disease; altered state of consciousness; blood brain barrier; brain infection; brain stem; cerebellum; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; flaccid paralysis; human; hypoxia; locomotion; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; neurotransmission; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thalamus; virus encephalitis; virus infectivity; virus strain; animal; Betacoronavirus; brain; central nervous system; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; metabolism; pandemic; pathology; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Central Nervous System; Coronavirus Infections; Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Proteins","32474399","EBioMedicine",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085384158

Methods: a systematic literature review assessing papers published in the most comprehensive databases in the field of health intended to answer the question, “What are the effects of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, and what is the neonatal prognosis?” Results: 49 papers published in 2020 were eligible, presenting low levels of evidence. A total of 755 pregnant women and 598 infants were assessed; more than half of pregnant women had C-sections (379/65%). Only 493 (82%) infants were tested for SARS-CoV-2, nine (2%) of whom tested positive. There is, however, no evidence of vertical transmission based on what has been assessed so far, considering there are knowledge gaps concerning the care provided during and after delivery, as well as a lack of suitable biological samples for testing SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: We cannot rule out potential worsening of the clinical conditions of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, whether the infection is associated with comorbidities or not, due to the occurrence of respiratory disorders, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and acid-base imbalance, among others. We recommend relentless monitoring of all pregnant women in addition to testing them before delivery or the first contact with newborns. © 2020 by the authors.

To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW™ COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min. More so, isothermal platforms are cost effective and could easily be scaled up to resource limited settings. Diagnostics developers, scientific community and commercial companies could consider this alternative method to help stop the spread of COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung Findings and Diagnosis Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Therapy and Course of events The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. Conclusion This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart New York.","COVID-19; COVID-19 associated pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; lactate dehydrogenase; procalcitonin; sultamicillin; virus RNA; adult; auscultation; bacterial infection; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; construction worker; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; crackle; drug withdrawal; emergency ward; faintness; fever; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; hypertension; lung infiltrate; middle aged; patient isolation; physical examination; polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum analysis; thorax radiography; throat culture; virus pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; male; oropharynx; pandemic; SARS coronavirus; sputum; virology; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oropharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; SARS Virus; Sputum","32403153","Dtsch.

Our objective was to identify, from international literature, the most common symptoms met in older adults infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE from December 1, 2019 to April 13, 2020. The analysis of methodological quality used a method dedicated to case series and case reports. Out of 260 articles initially identified, only two studies were finally included in the qualitative analysis. The mean age was relatively low, between 71 and 74 years on average. The symptoms of COVID-19 were as follows: fever, dry cough, dyspnea, asthenia, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhea, and to a lesser extent myalgia, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and finally vomiting. Lymphopenia was found in the complete blood count. In conclusion, this systematic review of the international literature reveals a lack of data about the semiology of COVID-19 in older adults, especially in the frail oldest-old ones who commonly define the geriatric population. The national survey conducted by the French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology will help fill this semiological gap. © 2020 John Libbey Eurotext.

A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, clinical treatment, and development of vaccines, is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. The past three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus infections at the beginning of the 21st century have highlighted the importance of readily available, accurate, and rapid diagnostic technologies to contain emerging and re-emerging pandemics. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) based assays performed on respiratory specimens remain the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging with high sensitivity and specificity as well. Even though excellent techniques are available for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 in well-equipped laboratories; critical gaps still remain in screening asymptomatic people who are in the incubation phase of the virus, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions for ending isolation. This review article aims to discuss the currently available laboratory methods and surveillance technologies available for the detection of COVID-19, their performance characteristics and highlight the gaps in current diagnostic capacity, and finally, propose potential solutions. We also summarize the specifications of the majority of the available commercial kits (PCR, EIA, and POC) for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; Diagnostic challenges; Molecular testing; SARS-CoV-2; Serology; Viruses","gold nanoparticle; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; nucleocapsid protein; chemiluminescence immunoassay; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; CRISPR Cas system; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; diagnostic test; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme immunoassay; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; immune response; laboratory diagnosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleic acid amplification; point of care testing; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification; Review; sensitivity and specificity; serology; seroprevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy; virus load; virus neutralization; virus replication; virus shedding; asymptomatic infection; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic kit; laboratory technique; pandemic; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; serodiagnosis; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Asymptomatic Infections; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Neutralization Tests; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Point-of-Care Testing; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serologic Tests; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Virus Shedding","32466458","Viruses",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085636317

The release of danger-associated molecular patterns during severe COVID-19 results in both pulmonary epithelial damage and inflammatory disease, which are predisposing risk factors for pulmonary aspergillosis. Moreover, collateral effects of host recognition pathways required for the activation of antiviral immunity may, paradoxically, contribute to a highly permissive inflammatory environment that favors fungal pathogenesis. Diagnosis of CAPA remains challenging, mainly because bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan testing and culture, which represent the most sensitive diagnostic tests for aspergillosis in the ICU, are hindered by the fact that bronchoscopies are rarely performed in COVID-19 patients due to the risk of disease transmission. Similarly, autopsies are rarely performed, which may result in an underestimation of the prevalence of CAPA. Finally, the treatment of CAPA is complicated by drug–drug interactions associated with broad spectrum azoles, renal tropism and damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, which may challenge the use of liposomal amphotericin B, as well as the emergence of azole-resistance. This clinical reality creates an urgency for new antifungal drugs currently in advanced clinical development with more promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. © 2020 by the authors.

Herein, we aimed to investigate unclear issues related to transmission and pathogenesis of disease as well as accuracy of diagnostic tests and treatment modalities. A literature search on PubMed, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was con-ducted, and articles pertinent to identified search terms were extracted. A snow-ball search strategy was followed in order to retrieve additional relevant articles. It was reported that viral spread may occur during the asymptomatic phase of infection, and viral load was suggested to be a useful marker to assess disease severity. In contrast to immune response against viral infections, cytotoxic T lymphocytes decline in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be partially explained by direct invasion of T lymphocytes or apoptosis activated by SARS-CoV-2. Dysregulation of the urokinase pathway, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by FXa and FIIa, and consumption coagulopathy were the proposed mechanisms of the coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19. False-negative rates of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction varied between 3% and 41% across studies. The probability of the positive test was proposed to decrease with the number of days past from symptom onset. Safety issues related to infection spread limit the use of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in hypoxic patients. Further studies are required to elucidate the challenging issues, thus enhancing the management of COVID-19 patients. © 2020, AVES.

This convalescent plasma therapy is of particular interest when a vaccine or specific therapy is not yet available for emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. This report summarizes existing literature around convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for COVID-19. It also includes recommendations for establishing a convalescent plasma program, enhancement considerations for convalescent plasma, and considerations around pathogen reduction treatment of convalescent plasma. Time is of the essence to set up protocols for collection, preparation, and administration of apheresis-collected convalescent plasma in response to the current pandemic. The immediate use of convalescent plasma provides prompt availability of a promising treatment while specific vaccines and treatments are evaluated and brought to scale. Further development of improved convalescent plasma, vaccines and other therapeutics depends on quick generation of additional data on pathogenesis and immune response. Additionally, given the lack of information around the natural history of this disease, PRT should be considered to add a layer of safety to protect recipients of convalescent plasma. © 2020 The Author(s)","Convalescent plasma; COVID-19; Pathogen reduction; PRT; SARS-CoV-2","virus vaccine; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; apheresis; clinical assessment; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; human; immune response; nonhuman; pathogenesis; plasma transfusion; Review; Betacoronavirus; blood; blood safety; communicable disease; convalescence; Coronavirus infection; donor selection; Food and Drug Administration; immunology; meta analysis (topic); pandemic; passive immunization; plasmapheresis; severe acute respiratory syndrome; United States; virology; virus inactivation; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Blood Safety; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Convalescence; Coronavirus Infections; Donor Selection; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Pandemics; Plasmapheresis; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Virus Inactivation","32345485","Transfus.

In addition to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, the host hyper-inflammatory response has emerged as a key factor in determining disease severity and mortality. Accumulating clinical observations raised hypotheses to explain why some patients develop more severe disease while others only manifest mild or no symptoms. So far, Covid-19 management remains mainly supportive. However, many researches are underway to clarify the role of antiviral and immunomodulating drugs in changing morbidity and mortality in patients who become severely ill.

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors. Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches. Implications for Practice: The main management strategies for treating cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic include clear communication and education about hand hygiene, infection control measures, high-risk exposure, and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Consideration of risk and benefit for active intervention in the cancer population must be individualized. Postponing elective surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer patients with low risk of progression should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Minimizing outpatient visits can help to mitigate exposure and possible further transmission. Telemedicine may be used to support patients to minimize number of visits and risk of exposure. More research is needed to better understand SARS-CoV-2 virology and epidemiology. © 2020 The Authors.

The clinical course of the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung failure. The virus is currently rapidly spreading around the world and pushing health systems to the limits of their capacity due to the exponential increase in the number of cases. The origin of SARS-CoV‑2 lies in the bat coronavirus pool and has now emerged in the human population due to interspecies transmission. Molecular diagnostic methods have been established in a very short time and a number of clinical studies on the effectiveness of different antiviral drugs are ongoing. The development of a vaccine using different approaches is also under investigation. Considering the high number of cases and mortality rates of up to 9% there is an urgent need for action.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: (1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; (2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; (3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; (4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; (5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient. Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19 pandemic; Head and neck cancer; Head and neck oncology; Mucosal squamous cell carcinoma; Multilevel risk; Risk stratification; SARS-CoV-2; Surgical barriers; Surgical risk; Treatment paradigms","alternative medicine; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; clinical decision making; clinical evaluation; clinical protocol; conservative treatment; coronavirus disease 2019; head and neck cancer; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; head and neck surgery; health care disparity; health care personnel; health care quality; health care system; high risk patient; high risk population; human; infection prevention; pandemic; patient decision making; patient safety; perioperative period; postoperative period; practice guideline; preoperative evaluation; primary tumor; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; risk factor; risk management; salivary gland cancer; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shared decision making; skin cancer; society; surgical oncology; surgical patient; surgical risk; systematic review (topic); therapy delay; thyroid cancer; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; head and neck tumor; infection control; oncology; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Infection Control; Medical Oncology; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Surgical Oncology","32330858","Oral Oncol.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083358166

In this review, we summarized the recent studies reporting of gastrointestinal and liver manifestations during the course of COVID-19. Digestive symptoms, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and in some cases digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the stool of infected patients, implicating the possibility of fecal–oral transmission. Attention should also be paid to monitor liver function during the course of COVID-19, especially in patients with higher disease severity.

Aquatic environments, lakes, rivers and ponds, are important habitats for bats and birds, which are hosts for various coronavirus species and strains and which shed viral particles in their feces. It is therefore of high interest to fully explore the role that aquatic environments may play in coronavirus spread, including cross-species transmissions. Besides the respiratory tract, coronaviruses pathogenic to humans can also infect the digestive system and be subsequently defecated. Considering this, it is pivotal to understand whether wastewater can play a role in their dissemination, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. This review provides an overview of the taxonomy, molecular biology, natural reservoirs and pathogenicity of coronaviruses; outlines their potential to survive in aquatic environments and wastewater; and demonstrates their association with aquatic biota, mainly waterfowl. It also calls for further, interdisciplinary research in the field of aquatic virology to explore the potential hotspots of coronaviruses in the aquatic environment and the routes through which they may enter it. © 2020 by the authors.","Aquatic environment; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; Emerging infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2; Viral infection; Wastewater; Zoonosis","Digestive system; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Viruses; Aquatic environments; Coronaviruses; Interdisciplinary research; Research interests; Respiratory tract; Scientific community; Single stranded RNA; Viral particles; Diseases; aquatic environment; digestive system; epidemic; molecular analysis; pathogenicity; respiratory disease; taxonomy; virus; wastewater; water chemistry; Anatidae; Aves; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus; RNA viruses; SARS coronavirus",,"Water",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087527185

The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60–95%. We used these values to re-calculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60–70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on. It is therefore hazardous to judge progress of the epidemic based on observed epidemic curves unless quality of testing is better understood. © 2020, The Canadian Public Health Association.","Epidemic; Misclassification; Probabilistic bias analysis; SARS-CoV-2","Canada; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; laboratory technique; pandemic; probability; sensitivity and specificity; statistical bias; virus pneumonia; Bias; Canada; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemics; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Probability; Sensitivity and Specificity","32578184","Can.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on 13 March 2020 and its rapid onset, spatial extent and complex consequences make it a once-in-a-century global disaster. Most countries responded by social distancing measures and severely diminished economic and other activities. Consequently, by the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous environmental impacts, both positive such as enhanced air and water quality in urban areas, and negative, such as shoreline pollution due to the disposal of sanitary consumables. This study presents an early overview of the observed and potential impacts of the COVID-19 on the environment.

Several studies have demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is also a potential route. As the pandemic is continuously evolving, and more data are made available, this article highlights the best evidence and practices regarding the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus relevant to GI practice. Published clinical studies have supported that SARS-CoV-2 affects the GI tract and the liver. The largest published dataset comprised of 4243 patients and showed a pooled prevalence of GI symptoms at 17.6%. GI symptoms varied and usually preceded pulmonary symptoms by 1–2 days. These include anorexia (26.8%), nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.5%), and abdominal pain (9.2%). Incidence of liver injury ranges from 15 to 53%. Evidence shows that the severity of COVID-19 infection is compounded by its effects on nutrition, most especially for the critically ill. As such, nutrition societies have recommended optimization of oral diets and oral nutritional supplements followed by early enteral nutrition if nutritional targets are not met, and parenteral nutrition in the distal end of the spectrum. In addition to possible fecal–oral transmission, GI endoscopy procedures, which are considered to be aerosol-generating procedures, contribute to increased risk to GI health-care professionals. Infection prevention measures and guidelines are essential in protecting both patients and personnel. © 2020 The Authors.

This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cell susceptibility; coronavirus; dissemination; nervous system","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; ambiguus nucleus; brain stem; central nervous system infection; chemoreceptor; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coughing; fever; human; mechanoreceptor; neurologic disease; nonhuman; respiratory failure; respiratory system; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; solitary tract nucleus; synapse; viral tropism; virus latency; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; central nervous system; China; Coronavirus infection; headache; lung; mechanotransduction; nausea; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; physiology; respiratory failure; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; Central Nervous System; China; Coronavirus Infections; Headache; Humans; Lung; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Nausea; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Insufficiency; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Vomiting","32104915","J.

Although there are a number of issues to be considered, the following points are most urgent: The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread. The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry. The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical military service animals including explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, combat tracker dog, mine detection dog, tactical explosive detector dog, improvised explosive device detector dog, patrol explosive detector dog, and patrol narcotics detector dog, as well as multipurpose canines used by special operations such as used by the U.S. customs and border protection agency (e.g., Beagle Brigade). This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions. What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans? What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock? What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers? Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study. First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers. If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created. Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","companion animals; coronavirus; COVID-19; livestock","anosmia; beagle; coronavirus disease 2019; detection dog; dog; domestic animal; human; hyposmia; lethargy; livestock; needs assessment; nonhuman; pandemic; population density; poultry; priority journal; research; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus infectivity; virus transmission; zoonosis; animal; Betacoronavirus; bird disease; Coronavirus infection; dog disease; history; laboratory technique; livestock; needs assessment; pandemic; pathology; pet animal; smelling disorder; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Dog Diseases; Dogs; History, 21st Century; Humans; Livestock; Needs Assessment; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pets; Pneumonia, Viral; Poultry Diseases; Zoonoses","32374208","Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084616413

Practices in surgical oncology had to change in response to these resource limitations, triaging based on acuity, expected oncologic outcomes, availability of supportive resources, and safety of health care personnel. Methods: The MD Anderson Head and Neck Surgery Treatment Guidelines Consortium devised the following to provide guidance on triaging head and neck cancer (HNC) surgeries based on multidisciplinary consensus. HNC subsites considered included aerodigestive tract mucosa, sinonasal, salivary, endocrine, cutaneous, and ocular. Recommendations: Each subsite is presented separately with disease-specific recommendations. Options for alternative treatment modalities are provided if surgical treatment needs to be deferred. Conclusion: These guidelines are intended to help clinicians caring for patients with HNC appropriately allocate resources during a health care crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data Sources: Clinical data were derived from peer-reviewed primary literature and published guidelines from national or international medical organizations. Preprint manuscripts and popular media articles provided background information and illustrative examples. Methods: Included manuscripts were identified via searches using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, while organizational guidelines and popular media articles were identified using Google search queries. Practice guidelines were developed via consensus among all authors based on peer-reviewed manuscripts and national or international health care association guidelines. Strict objective criteria for inclusion were not used due to the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and a paucity of rigorous empirical evidence. Conclusions: In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care must be judiciously allocated to treat the most severe conditions while minimizing the risk of long-term sequelae and ensuring patient, physician, and health care worker safety. Implications for Practice: The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short- and long-term impact on health care worldwide. Although the full repercussions of this disease have yet to be realized, the outlined recommendations will guide otolaryngologists in the treatment of pediatric patients in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","COVID-19; otolaryngology; pediatric otolaryngology; SARS-CoV-2","airway reconstruction; audiology; bronchoscopy; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; extracorporeal oxygenation; head and neck infection; head and neck surgery; head injury; health care personnel; hearing impairment; human; laryngoscopy; lung surgery; maxillofacial injury; nasopharynx; nose cavity; nose obstruction; otologic surgery; pandemic; practice guideline; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tracheotomy; uterine cervicitis; Betacoronavirus; child; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; ear nose throat surgery; elective surgery; global health; male; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; patient safety; patient selection; pediatrics; preschool child; procedures; risk assessment; United States; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Global Health; Humans; Male; Otolaryngology; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Patient Selection; Pediatrics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Assessment; United States","32340588","Otolaryngol.

Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase – Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1–2 wk may be advised. As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children. © 2020, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Acute lung injury; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; ARDS; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir; Multiorgan dysfunction; Ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2; Severe pneumonia","hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; antivirus agent; lopinavir; proteinase inhibitor; ritonavir; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; assisted ventilation; breast feeding; case fatality rate; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; critical illness; critically ill patient; dyspnea; environmental sanitation; fever; health care personnel; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalized child; human; infection control; infection risk; isolation; laboratory diagnosis; multiple organ failure; noninvasive ventilation; pediatric patient; practice guideline; respiratory tract disease; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; symptom; thorax radiography; throat culture; travel; ventilated patient; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; genetics; infant; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; palliative therapy; pandemic; preschool child; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; Acute Lung Injury; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Infant; Lopinavir; Palliative Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protease Inhibitors; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ritonavir; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32338347","Indian J.

To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e., ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy for conferring immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as postexposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure for undertaking collections and constructing inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections, and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, including evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow, and proposed clinical trials, as scaleup is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource. © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",,"hyperimmune globulin; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; China; compassionate use; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; human; Middle East respiratory syndrome; plasma transfusion; post exposure prophylaxis; priority journal; Review; risk benefit analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; workflow; adverse event; Betacoronavirus; blood; blood donor; Coronavirus infection; drug approval; Food and Drug Administration; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; risk assessment; United States; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Blood Donors; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Investigational New Drug Application; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration","32254064","J.

Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable “real-time” monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound.

As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues. Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage. Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"azithromycin; biological marker; C reactive protein; corticosteroid; cytokine receptor antagonist; host factor; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; immunomodulating agent; interferon; Janus kinase inhibitor; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nucleoside analog; recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2; recombinant enzyme; remdesivir; unclassified drug; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; immunologic factor; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; toll like receptor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antigen antibody complex; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; case fatality rate; clinical feature; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine response; cytokine storm; host range; human; immune evasion; immunocompetent cell; immunology; immunomodulation; immunopathology; immunotherapy; infection risk; innate immunity; macrophage; monocyte; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; phenotype; plasma; priority journal; protein expression; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survivor; vaccination; viral clearance; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus load; virus morphology; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease management; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disease Management; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immune Evasion; Immunologic Factors; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Toll-Like Receptors; Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins","32353634","Clin.

A total of 1,016,399 cases of COVID-19 with 53,238 deaths was reported from 204 countries and territories including two international conveyances over the world. After China, most of the new cases were from Europe, particularly Italy acting as the source of importation to many of the other countries around the world. China has obtained success by ascribing control strategies against COVID-19. The implementation of China's strategy, as well as the development of a vaccine, may control the pandemic of COVID-19. Further robust studies are required for a clear understanding of transmission parameters, prevention, and control strategies of SARSCoV-2.

Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020. Results: The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. Conclusions: The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults. Deaths were extremely rare. © 2020 The Authors.

As an aerosol-generating procedure, tracheostomy increases the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19 infection. Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care. Methods: This study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways. Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID-19 were derived by consensus and available evidence. Results: Modified guidelines for all phases of tracheostomy care at an academic tertiary care center in the setting of COVID-19 are presented.

Heart failure and myocardial damage, shown by increased troponin plasma levels, occur in at least 10% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with higher percentages, 25% to 35% or more, when patients critically ill or with concomitant cardiac disease are considered. Myocardial injury may be elicited by multiple mechanisms, including those occurring with all severe infections, such as fever, tachycardia, adrenergic stimulation, as well as those caused by an exaggerated inflammatory response, endotheliitis and, in some cases, myocarditis that have been shown in patients with COVID-19. A key role may be that of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1–7, which has vasodilating and anti-inflammatory effects. Virus-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 may increase angiotensin II stimulation and contribute to the deleterious hyper-inflammatory reaction of COVID-19. On the other hand, ACE2 may be up-regulated in patients with cardiac disease and treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. ACE2 up-regulation may increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 but may be also protective vs. angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and inflammatory activation. Recent data show the lack of untoward effects of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for COVID-19 infection and severity. Prospective trials are needed to ascertain whether these drugs may have protective effects. © 2020 European Society of Cardiology","Angiotensin II; COVID-19; Heart failure","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; human; nonhuman; priority journal; Review","32412156","Eur.

These events pose serious threats to public health due to time lags in developing vaccines to activate the acquired immune system. The high variability of people’s symptomatic responses to viral infections, as illustrated in the current COVID-19 pandemic, indicates the potential to moderate the severity of morbidity from VRIs. Growing evidence supports roles for probiotic bacteria (PB) and prebiotic dietary fiber (DF) and other plant nutritional bioactives in modulating immune functions. While human studies help to understand the epidemiology and immunopathology of VRIs, the chaotic nature of viral transmissions makes it difficult to undertake mechanistic study where the pre-conditioning of the metabolic and immune system could be beneficial. However, recent experimental studies have significantly enhanced our understanding of how PB and DF, along with plant bioactives, can significantly modulate innate and acquired immunity responses to VRIs. Synbiotic combinations of PB and DF potentiate increased benefits primarily through augmenting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate. These and specific plant polyphenolics help to regulate immune responses to both restrain VRIs and temper the neutrophil response that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This review highlights the current understanding of the potential impact of targeted nutritional strategies in setting a balanced immune tone for viral clearance and reinforcing homeostasis. This knowledge may guide the development of public health tactics and the application of functional foods with PB and DF components as a nutritional approach to support countering VRI morbidity. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; Dietary fiber; Dysbiosis; Functional foods; Gut microbiota; Innate immune response; Probiotic; Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); Synbiotic",,,"Microorg.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087058939

NAD+ is an essential coenzyme that plays important roles in various metabolic pathways and increasing its overall content has been confirmed as a valuable strategy for treating a wide variety of pathophysiological conditions. Accumulating evidence on NRs’ health benefits has validated its efficiency across numerous animal and human studies for the treatment of a number of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic disorders. As the prevalence and morbidity of these conditions increases in modern society, the great necessity has arisen for a rapid translation of NR to therapeutic use and further establishment of its availability as a nutritional supplement. Here, we summarize currently available data on NR effects on metabolism, and several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, through to its application as a treatment for specific pathophysiological conditions. In addition, we have reviewed newly published research on the application of NR as a potential therapy against infections with several pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, to support rapid NR translation to therapeutics, the challenges related to its bioavailability and safety are addressed, together with the advantages of NR to other NAD+ precursors. © 2020 by the authors.

The other 62 referenced papers were of different types (eg, reviews, WHO protocols, letter to editor etc). Study selection The study selected trials, reviews, and in-vitro research assessing the critical aspects of saliva as an easily accessible and early-stage diagnostic source, and also an entry route for 2019-nCoV. Most of the clinical studies were descriptive case series of patients who had contracted 2019-nCoV in China. These were mainly studies designed to compare saliva samples with throat swabs, with regard to the presence of 2019-nCoV RNA. Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers. Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV. Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts. Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence. © 2020, British Dental Association.",,"Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; saliva; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Saliva","32591666","Evid.-based Dent.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086869851

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","contamination; COVID-19; head neck; otolaryngology; risk of contamination; surgery","clinical examination; Conference Paper; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; ear nose throat surgery; endoscopy; follow up; head and neck surgery; human; infection risk; intubation; occupational exposure; otolaryngologist; pandemic; patient referral; practice guideline; priority journal; risk reduction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; surgeon; susceptible population; tracheostomy; Betacoronavirus; clinical practice; Coronavirus infection; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; practice guideline; prevention and control; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Otolaryngology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'","32270581","Head Neck",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083273737

Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality. Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes. This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19. Recent Findings: Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes. Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality. Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population. Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19. Summary: Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes. Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis. Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome. A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cancer; Cardio-oncology; Cardiovascular disease; COVID-19","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anthracycline; chemokine receptor CCR5; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; heparin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; leronlimab; sarilumab; simvastatin; sunitinib; thromboplastin; tocilizumab; vasculotropin inhibitor; anticoagulation; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; dengue; disease severity; disease transmission; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; high risk population; human; hypertension; immune related adverse event; immunopathology; infection risk; ischemia; Italy; kidney carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; pneumonia; prevalence; prognosis; renal cell carcinoma; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; telemedicine; thrombosis; United States; Betacoronavirus; cardiology; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; oncology; physiology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cardiology; Cardiotoxicity; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors","32462289","Curr.

Since COVID-19 causes mild to severe acute respiratory syndrome, most studies in this field have only focused on different aspects of pathogenesis in the respiratory system. However, evidence suggests that COVID-19 may affect the central nervous system (CNS). Given the outbreak of COVID-19, it seems necessary to perform investigations on the possible neurological complications in patients who suffered from COVID-19. Here, we reviewed the evidence of the neuroinvasive potential of coronaviruses and discussed the possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection by COVID-19 to provide a precise insight for future studies. © 2020, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Nervous system; Neuroinvasion; Transmission routes","central nervous system infection; coronavirus disease 2019; human; neurological complication; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; ataxia; Betacoronavirus; blood brain barrier; brain edema; central nervous system; complication; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; epilepsy; immunology; multiple sclerosis; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; prevalence; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus encephalitis; virus pneumonia; Ataxia; Betacoronavirus; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Edema; Central Nervous System; Coronavirus Infections; Encephalitis, Viral; Epilepsy; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","32418055","J.

In less than two and half months (11 March, 2020) it was declared as a pandemic disease due to its rapid spreading ability, it covered more than 211 countries infecting around 1.7 million persons and claiming around 1.1 lakhs lives within merely 100 days of its emergence. Containment of the infection of this virus is the only available measure to control the disease as no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is available. Confirmed detection of the virus followed by isolation of the infected person at the earliest possible is the only measure to prevent this disease. Although there are number of methods available for detection of virus and to combat this disease in the present pandemic situation, but these available diagnostic methods have their own limitations. The speedy and exponential global spread of this disease strongly urges the fast and economic diagnostics tools. Additional to the available diagnostic methods, there is a sudden surge for development of various of methods and platforms to diagnose the COVID-19. The review summarized the advantage and disadvantage of various diagnostic approaches being used presently for COVID-19, newer detection methods in developmental stage and the feasibility of advanced platforms like newer nano-sensor based on-the-spot detection technologies. © 2020, Indian Virological Society.","Biosensor; COVID-19; Diagnostic method for COVID-19; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV2","antibody detection; antigen detection; antiviral therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; high throughput sequencing; human; infection control; loop mediated isothermal amplification; nonhuman; point of care testing; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus carrier; virus detection; virus isolation; x-ray computed tomography",,"VirusDisease",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086455049

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World. Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only. COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918–1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.

This study analyses the COVID-19 infection data from the top 15 affected countries in which we observed heterogeneous growth patterns of the virus. Hence, this paper applies multifractal formalism on COVID-19 data with the notion that country-specific infection rates follow a power law growth behaviour. According to the estimated generalized fractal dimension curves, the effects of drastic containment measures on the pandemic in India indicate that a significant reduction of the infection rate as its population is concern.

Early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment are the most effective means of prevention and control. At present, the epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection has tended to be controlled in China, and it is still in a period of rapid rise in much of the world. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of coronavirus nucleic acids, but imaging has an important role in the detection of lung lesions, stratification, evaluation of treatment strategies, and differentiation of mixed infections.

A systematic review has been performed of papers published until 5 April 2020. 29 papers related to neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 were examined. The results show presence of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations related to coronavirus. Neurological manifestations, or NeuroCOVID, are part of the COVID-19 clinical picture, but questions remain regarding the frequency and severity of CNS symptoms, the mechanism of action underlying neurological symptoms, and the relationship of symptoms with the course and severity of COVID-19. Further clinical, epidemiological, and basic science research is urgently needed to understand and address neurological sequalae of COVID-19. Concomitant risk factors or determinants (e.g. demographic factors, comorbidities, or available biomarkers) that may predispose a person with COVID-19 to neurological manifestations also need to be identified. The review shows that although more and more papers are reporting neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19; however, many items remain unclear and this uncertainty calls for a global action that requires close coordination and open-data sharing between hospitals, academic institutions and the fast establishment of harmonised research priorities and research consortia to face the NeuroCOVID-19 complications. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Central nervous system; COVID-19; NeuroCOVID; Neurological symptoms; Peripheral nervous system; Research","acroparesthesia; acute disease; allodynia; altered state of consciousness; anosmia; ataxia; brain disease; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; central nervous system; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; consciousness disorder; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; delirium; disease course; disease predisposition; disease severity; dizziness; dysarthria; dysgeusia; electroencephalogram; encephalitis; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; human; hypogeusia; hyposmia; muscle injury; myalgia; neurologic disease; paresthesia; peripheral nervous system; priority journal; research priority; respiratory failure; Review; rhabdomyolysis; risk factor; seizure; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32436101","J.

Multifunctional graphene platforms were proposed for the detection of several typical biomarkers (i.e., circulating tumor cells, exosomes, circulating nucleic acids, etc.) in liquid biopsy, and numerous methods, including optical, electrochemical, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), etc., have been developed for their detection. Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides. Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders. Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review aimed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth summarization of the contribution of graphene-based nanomaterials in liquid biopsy, discussing the remaining challenges and the future trend; moreover, the paper gave the first look at the potentiality of graphene in COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. Comments: This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level. © The Author(s) 2020.","coronavirus; COVID-19; mental health; Outbreak","Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; mental health; pandemic; pathogenicity; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32233719","Int.

Hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein that facilitates entry of coronavirus into cells, may increase in patients using RAS inhibitors. Thus, chronic use of RAS inhibition could potentially lead to a more severe and fatal form of COVID-19. In this review, we provide a critical review to the following questions: (1) Does hypertension influence immunity or ACE2 expression favoring viral infections? (2) Are the risks of complications in hypertension mediated by its treatment? (3) Is aging a major factor associated with worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension? Recent Findings: Despite the potential involvement of immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension, there is no evidence supporting that hypothesis that hypertension or RAS inhibitors contributes to unfavorable outcomes in viral infections. Future investigations adopting a strict protocol for confirming hypertension status as well as assessing associated comorbidities that may influence outcomes are necessary. From the therapeutic perspective, recombinant ACE2 may serve as a potential therapy, but relevant studies in humans are lacking. Definitive evidence regarding the use of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 is needed; 5 randomized trials examining this issue are currently underway. Summary: There is no current scientific support for claiming that hypertension or its treatment with RAS inhibitors contribute to unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Hypertension; Outcomes; Prognosis; RAS inhibition; Treatment","angiotensin antagonist; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2; recombinant enzyme; renin inhibitor; unclassified drug; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adverse outcome; aging; clinical outcome; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; disease association; heart failure; human; hypertension; immune response; lung disease; nonhuman; outcome assessment; pandemic; pathogenesis; prognosis; protein expression; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); complication; Coronavirus infection; hypertension; metabolism; pandemic; prognosis; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hypertension; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Risk Factors","32535705","Curr.

As such, the present work aims to identify risk factors for mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19. Given that single-centre studies are less likely informative as elderly remains a minority in the total Chinese population, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources in the public domain. Based on the data of 154 individuals from 26 provinces, age remained a key mortality risk factor among geriatric patients of different ages. While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. Against mixed results, more research should be done on identifying comorbidities associated with mortality in geriatric patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Elderly; Geriatric patients; Mortality; Risk factors","aged; body temperature; China; Chinese; clinical feature; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; dyspnea; fatality; female; fever; geriatric patient; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; mortality risk; pneumonia; priority journal; Review; risk factor; thorax pain; very elderly; complication; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; mortality; pandemic; predictive value; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; China; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors","32353398","Mech.

In the field of functional urology, there are clinical situations with a high risk of complication if management is delayed and a great heterogeneity of advisable reprogramming times after cancellation. A prioritization of functional urology procedures is necessary to adapt management during the COVID-19 crisis and to better organize post-epidemic recovery. Material and methods: The advice of AFU scientific committees in the field of functional urology (neuro-urology, female and perineology, male LUTS) was requested and supplemented by a review of the currently available recommendations on the subject of urology and COVID-19. These opinions were combined to draw up temporary recommendations to help reorganize practices during the epidemic and prepare the post-critical phase. Results: Most of the recommendations available on career-oriented social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn) or in literature concern cancer or general urology. Eight out of ten propose a cancellation of all functional urology procedures without distinction. But the 3 AFU committees covering the field of functional urology have identified three clinical situations in which surgical procedures that can be maintained during the COVID-19 epidemic (priority level A): conclusion of a neuromodulation test in progress (implantation or explantation), botulinum toxin A bladder injections for unbalanced neurologic bladder, cystectomy and ileal conduit for urinary fistula in perineal bedsore or refractory unbalanced neurologic bladder with acute renal failure and vesico-enteric or prostato-pubic fistulas. Management adaptation of the other pathologies are proposed, as well as the application of 3 priority levels (B, C, D) for rescheduled procedures for a better management of the post-crisis activity resumption. Conclusion: The joint functional urology committees indicate that there are specific clinical situations in this field that demand non-delayed care during COVID crisis. They underline the need to establish a hierarchy for the cancelled surgeries, in order to reduce the arm of long reschedule delays and to optimize post-lockdown activity resumption. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SASObjectif: La prise en charge des patients d'urologie est bouleversée par l’épidémie de COVID-19. En urologie fonctionnelle, certaines situations cliniques sont à haut risque de complication en cas de retard de prise en charge et il existe une grande hétérogénéité de délais souhaitables de reprogrammation en cas d'annulation. Une hiérarchisation de la priorité accordée aux actes d'urologie fonctionnelle est donc nécessaire pour adapter les prises en charge durant la crise COVID-19 et mieux organiser la reprise d'activité post-épidémie. Matériel et méthode: L'avis des comités scientifiques de l'AFU dans le domaine de l'urologie fonctionnelle (comité de neuro-urologie, CUROPF, CTMH) a été sollicité et complété par une revue des recommandations sur le sujet urologie et COVID-19 diffusée sur les réseaux sociaux ou publiés. Ces avis ont été réunis pour établir des recommandations temporaires visant à aider la réorganisation des pratiques durant l’épidémie et lors de la phase post-critique. Résultats: La majorité des recommandations diffusées (littérature ou réseaux sociaux – Twitter, LinkedIn) concernent la cancérologie ou l'ensemble de l'urologie. Huit sur dix proposent une annulation en bloc de tous les actes d'urologie fonctionnelle sans distinction. Les 3 comités réunis identifient pourtant 3 situations où des actes chirurgicaux/instrumentaux devraient être maintenus durant l’épidémie de COVID-19 (niveau A de priorité) : 2e temps de test de neuromodulation en cours, injections vésicales de toxine botulique A pour neuro-vessie non équilibrée, cystectomie-Bricker pour fistule urinaire dans une escarre périnéale ou neuro-vessie non équilibrée avec insuffisance rénale récente et fistules vésico-entérales ou uro-osseuses. Des adaptations de prise en charge des autres pathologies sont proposées ainsi que l'application de 3 autres niveaux de priorité (B, C, D) afin d'aider à la reprogrammation lors de la reprise de l'activité post-crise COVID-19. Dans tous les cas, l'accompagnement du patient, en particulier, par téléconsultation est essentiel. Conclusion: Les 3 comités d'urologie fonctionnelle de l'AFU réunis indiquent qu'il existe des situations en urologie fonctionnelle pour lesquelles la prise en charge ne peut être retardée, pour les autres des adaptations sont proposées.

The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care. With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities. Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance. During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer. Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status. As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made. Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 0/7 weeks of gestation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 0/7 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features. Key Points Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants fewer office visits. Women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy.

We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.

Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system. It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient. Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis. The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible. © 2020","Acute appendicitis; Antibiotic therapy; Appendectomy; Coronavirus; COVID-19","antiinfective agent; acute disease; adult; algorithm; ambulatory care; appendectomy; appendicitis; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; patient selection; virus pneumonia; Acute Disease; Adult; Algorithms; Ambulatory Care; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Appendectomy; Appendicitis; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral","32362368","J.

The children from marginalized communities are particularly susceptible to the infection and may suffer from extended ill-consequences of this pandemic, such as child labor, child trafficking, child marriage, sexual exploitation and death etc. Parents, pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, hospital authorities, government and non-governmental organizations have important roles to play to mitigate the psychosocial ill-effects of COVID-19 on children and adolescents. To provide the basic amenities, social security, medical care, and to minimize the educational inequities among the children of the different strata of the society are foremost priorities. © 2020 Edizioni Minerva Medica.","Child abuse; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemics; Parenting","adolescent; Betacoronavirus; child; child abuse; Coronavirus infection; daily life activity; etiology; health care delivery; human; intellectual impairment; life event; mental stress; pandemic; prevention and control; psychology; quarantine; rescue personnel; risk factor; school; social exclusion; social isolation; socioeconomics; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child Abuse; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Responders; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Life Change Events; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Risk Factors; Schools; Social Isolation; Social Marginalization; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Vulnerable Populations","32613821","Minerva Pediatr.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085945686

To prepare for a pandemic, hospitals need a strategy to manage their space, staff, and supplies so that optimum care is provided to patients. In addition, infection prevention measures need to be implemented to reduce in-hospital transmission. In the operating room, these preparations involve multiple stakeholders and can present a significant challenge. Here, we describe the outbreak response measures of the anesthetic department staffing the largest (1,700-bed) academic tertiary level acute care hospital in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital) and a smaller regional hospital (Sengkang General Hospital). These include engineering controls such as identification and preparation of an isolation operating room, administrative measures such as modification of workflow and processes, introduction of personal protective equipment for staff, and formulation of clinical guidelines for anesthetic management. Simulation was valuable in evaluating the feasibility of new operating room set-ups or workflow. We also discuss how the hierarchy of controls can be used as a framework to plan the necessary measures during each phase of a pandemic, and review the evidence for the measures taken. These containment measures are necessary to optimize the quality of care provided to COVID-19 patients and to reduce the risk of viral transmission to other patients or healthcare workers. © 2020, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.",,"coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; health care personnel; health care quality; hospital emergency service; human; infection control; isolation facility; medical staff; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; risk reduction; Singapore; tertiary care center; workflow; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; operating room; pandemic; prevention and control; tertiary care center; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Infection Control; Operating Rooms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Singapore; Tertiary Care Centers","32162212","Can.

These malignancies develop in critical areas for eating, talking, and breathing and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite advances in treatment. Understanding of advances in the management of these various cancers is important for all multidisciplinary providers who care for patients across the cancer care continuum. Additionally, the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated adaptations to head and neck cancer care to accommodate the mitigation of COVID-19 risk and ensure timely treatment. This review explores advances in diagnostic criteria, prognostic factors, and management for subsites including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and the various forms of skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and melanoma).

For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure. Methods: Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. Findings: While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension. Furthermore, the recent COVID-19 crisis has been particularly devastating among African Americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease. Conclusion: The disparities in outcomes, which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity, in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors, highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for African Americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care. © 2020 National Medical Association","African Americans; COVID-19; Hypertension","aminopeptidase inhibitor; antihypertensive agent; glutamyl aminopeptidase; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; African American; antihypertensive therapy; blood pressure regulation; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; environmental factor; futurology; heart failure; heredity; human; hypertension; kidney denervation; lifestyle; lifestyle modification; mortality; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; prevalence; primary prevention; priority journal; resistant hypertension; Review; social determinants of health; sodium restriction; adult; African American; aged; cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus infection; ethnology; female; health care disparity; health disparity; hypertension; male; middle aged; needs assessment; pandemic; socioeconomics; survival analysis; United States; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Socioeconomic Factors; Survival Analysis; United States; Vulnerable Populations","32563685","J.

These cases are characterized by extreme variability, from a mild or asymptomatic form lasting for a few days up to severe forms of interstitial pneumonia that may require ventilatory therapy and can lead to patient death. Several hypotheses have been drawn up to understand the role of the interaction between the infectious agent and the immune system in the development of the disease and the most severe forms; the role of the cytokine storm seems important. Innate immunity, as one of the first elements of guest interaction with different infectious agents, could play an important role in the development of the cytokine storm and be responsible for boosting more severe forms. Therefore, it seems important to study also this important arm of the immune system to adequately understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Research on this topic is also needed to develop therapeutic strategies for treatment of this disease. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Innate immunity; Interferon; SARS; TLR","beta1a interferon; eculizumab; interferon; interferon beta serine; interleukin 6; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; cytokine; adaptive immunity; antiviral therapy; complement system; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; cytokine response; disease association; human; immunostimulation; innate immunity; macrophage; monocyte; neutrophil; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; protein expression; Review; signal transduction; virus infectivity; virus replication; asymptomatic disease; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; immunology; isolation and purification; metabolism; mortality; severity of illness index; virology; virus pneumonia; Asymptomatic Diseases; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index","32524333","Immunol.

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time. © 2020, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; nursing facilities; testing","clinician; coronavirus disease 2019; Delphi study; diagnostic test; Editorial; human; long term care; nonhuman; nursing home; nursing home patient; pandemic; priority journal; quarantine; real time polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; laboratory technique; prevalence; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Long-Term Care; Nursing Homes; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence","32510102","J.

Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"antivirus agent; virus vaccine; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; combination drug therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug approval; drug development; drug efficacy; drug quality; drug repositioning; drug research; drug safety; Editorial; European Medicines Agency; genotoxicity; investment; new (animal free) approach method; priority journal; quality control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal testing alternative; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug development; human; pandemic; preclinical study; procedures; virus pneumonia; Animal Testing Alternatives; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Development; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines","32447523","Arch.

The number of affected population is on rising, so is the mortality. This crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries. Due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns, a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome. During this period, oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns, reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic. Surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative. China, the source of this pandemic, has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic. Deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients. Many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data. Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients. In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors. While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means. Thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward. © 2020, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.","Cancer; Guidelines; Surgery; Triage","anesthesia; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer surgery; coronavirus disease 2019; digestive system cancer; emergency health service; female genital tract cancer; head and neck cancer; hepatobiliary system cancer; human; multidisciplinary team; pandemic; priority journal; Review; soft tissue cancer; thorax cancer; urinary tract cancer",,"Indian J.

An increase in arterial stiffness with advanced age has been reported in many publications. The aim of the present review is to summarize current information about possible chemical reactions and physical processes that lead to tissue stiffening and result in age-related diseases in order to find methods that can prevent or retard time-dependent tissue stiffening. The analysis of published data shows that bound water acts as a plasticizer of biological tissues, a decrease in bound water content results in an increase in biological tissue stiffness, and increased tissue stiffness leads to NF-kB activation and triggered actin polymerization-NF-kB activation is associated with age-related diseases. It can be suggested that changes in bound water content through changing tissue stiffness can affect cellular processes and the development of pathologies related to aging. Both age-related diseases and COVID-19 may be associated with tight-junction disruption and increased tissue stiffness and permeability. © 2020 by the author.","Age-related diseases; Bound water; Hydration; Stiffness","Activation analysis; Chemical activation; Proteins; Stiffness; Actin polymerization; Age-related disease; Arterial stiffness; Biological process; Biological tissues; Bound water contents; Cellular process; Physical process; Tissue",,"Polym.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087736302

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. Objective: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. Methods: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. Results: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. Conclusions: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses. © 2020, Mueller et al.","Aging; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Epigenetic clock; Immunity","adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; aging; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; genetic epigenesis; human; immunity; immunology; isolation and purification; pandemic; patient care; physiology; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aging; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Immunity; Pandemics; Patient Care Management; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","32470948","Aging",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086052504

A few months later, this viral infection had spread worldwide and became a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is multifactorial and associated with both specific antiviral as well as inflammatory responses, the extent of which may determine why some individuals are asymptomatic while others develop serious complications. Here we review possible life-threating immune events that can occur during disease progression to uncover key factors behind COVID-19 severity and provide suggestions for interventions with repurposed drugs in well-controlled and randomized clinical trials. These drugs include therapeutics with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells such as serine protease inhibitors of the cellular protease TMPS2 and drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system; antivirals with potential to block SARS-CoV-2 replication or factors that could boost the antiviral response; monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the hyperinflammatory response during COVID-19 progression toward the severe stage and therapeutics that could ameliorate the function of the lungs. Furthermore, in order to help make more informed decisions on the timing of the intervention with the drugs listed in this review, we have grouped these therapeutics according to the stage of COVID-19 progression that we considered most appropriate for their mechanism of action. © Copyright © 2020 Cardone, Yano, Rosenberg and Puig.","2019-nCoV; antiviral immune response; coronavirus; cytokine release syndrome; hyperinflammation; SARS-CoV-2; severe COVID-19; treatment strategies","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; CD147 antigen; complement component C3; complement component C3a; complement component C5; complement component C5a; gamma interferon; hyaluronic acid; inflammasome; interferon; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; mannose binding lectin associated serine protease; monoclonal antibody; peptides and proteins; serine proteinase inhibitor; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; transmembrane serine protease 2; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug repositioning; human; hyperinflammatory syndrome; immune response; inflammation; innate immunity; neutrophilia; nonhuman; protein expression; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus entry; virus replication; Coronavirus infection; immunology; inflammation; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Humans; Inflammation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32574265","Front.

The severity of the infection may be visible as pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and even death. Until the outbreak of SARS, this group of viruses was greatly overlooked. However, since the SARS and MERS outbreaks, these viruses have been studied in greater detail, propelling the vaccine research. On December 31, 2019, mysterious cases of pneumonia were detected in the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei Province. On January 7, 2020, the causative agent was identified as a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was later named as COVID-19 by the WHO. The virus spread extensively in the Wuhan region of China and has gained entry to over 210 countries and territories. Though experts suspected that the virus is transmitted from animals to humans, there are mixed reports on the origin of the virus. There are no treatment options available for the virus as such, limited to the use of anti-HIV drugs and/or other antivirals such as Remdesivir and Galidesivir. For the containment of the virus, it is recommended to quarantine the infected and to follow good hygiene practices. The virus has had a significant socio-economic impact globally. Economically, China is likely to experience a greater setback than other countries from the pandemic due to added trade war pressure, which have been discussed in this paper. © Copyright © 2020 Keni, Alexander, Nayak, Mudgal and Nandakumar.","2019-nCoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; pandemic; SARS; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Front.

The membrane bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point of COVID-19 2. Conversely, it supports an anti-inflammatory pathway. This led to the controversy of the impact of medications, which influence its expression. ACE2 is part of the wider renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and is upregulated via compounds, which inhibits the classical ACE, thereby plasma aldosterone and aldosterone receptor (MR) activation. MR activation may therefore protect organs from binding the COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 expression. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a frequent component in traditional Chinese medicines, which have been used to control COVID-19 infections. Its systemically active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) inhibits 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase(11betaHSD2) and activates MR in organs, which express this enzyme, including the lungs. Does this affect the protective effect of ACE2? Importantly, GL has anti-inflammatory properties by itself via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonism and therefore compensates for the reduced protection of the downregulated ACE2. Finally, a direct effect of GL or GA to reduce virus transmission exists, which may involve reduced expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), which is required for virus uptake. Glycyrrhizin may reduce the severity of an infection with COVID-19 at the two stages of the COVID-19 induced disease process, 1. To block the number of entry points and 2. provide an ACE2 independent anti-inflammatory mechanism. © Copyright © 2020 Murck.","11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; angiotensin converrting enzyme; Corona virus; COVID-19; glycyrrhizin; inflammation; mineralocorticoid receptor; toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)","aldosterone receptor; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; glycyrrhizic acid; toll like receptor 4; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; coronavirus receptors; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; glycyrrhizic acid; virus receptor; aldosterone blood level; antiinflammatory activity; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; human; infection control; protein expression; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; upregulation; virus attachment; virus entry; virus transmission; animal; Coronavirus infection; Glycyrrhiza; metabolism; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antiviral Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Glycyrrhiza; Glycyrrhizic Acid; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus","32574273","Front.

Point-of-care (POC) biosensors, including chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically low-cost and user-friendly, which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. This mini review article discusses the recent advances in POC biosensors for COVID-19. First, the development of POC biosensors which are made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), papers, and other flexible materials such as textile, film, and carbon nanosheets are reviewed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, test centers were shut down in many countries, and major tests including the TOEFL iBT and IELTS could not be administered. The DET is an “at home” test, and thus many universities began accepting DET scores as ameasure of applicants’ English proficiency. Because a revised version of the DET was launched in July, 2019, and because of the large increase in universities accepting DET scores, a critical review of the DET is warranted. The current review lauds the accessibility of the test (e.g., it is an inexpensive “at home” test that can be taken anywhere, in less than an hour, with scores returned in 48 hours). However, the test has multiple shortcomings: the test tasks have little in common with the types of language tasks university students engage in; the test does not assess test takers’ academic language ability, discourse level competence, or interactional competence; it is susceptible to cheating and test preparation; and it has a potential for negative washback on learners and learning systems. In addition, there is a lack of independent research validating the use of DET scores for admissions. Given these shortcomings, the use of DET scores cannot be recommended for university admissions purposes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,,,"Lang. Assess. Q.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087507886

After the emergence of the outbreak in the world and in our country, COVID-19 virology laboratory has been designed and diagnostic tests have been established for the early diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2. The routine diagnosis of COVID-19 is achieved by the detection of viral RNA in clinical samples using the nucleic acid amplification tests like real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rapid diagnosis during the early phases of the infection is critically important for the isolation of the patients and for the development of preventive measures to control the infection in the community. In this context, after the emergence of the pandemic, different diagnostic techniques (real-time PCR tests, rapid antibody tests, and ELISA tests) have been used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 in our hospital.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact. The airborne spread has not been established as a major route of transmission. The mean incubation period of the illness is 5 days and it mainly presents with fever and respiratory symptoms. Myalgia, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea and dermatological findings are also common during the course of the disease. Laboratory findings are nonspecific. Significant elevations in inflammation markers can be observed in some patients due to cytokine storm. Typical CT findings are bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral and lower lobes distribution. COVID-19 causes mild symptoms in most cases, however it may progress to severe pneumonia leading to ARDS and death, especially in those with advanced age and comorbid diseases. There is no specific effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. A number of in vitro effective agents have been identified. These agents such as chloroquine phosphate/hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir are widely used in the treatment of the disease.

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Considering that there is no specific drug or vaccine yet for COVID-19, effective rapid diagnosis of viruses has become very important in terms of early detection and control of the outbreak. The routine difficulties of isolating the virus necessitated the diagnosis to be made with more serological tests for many years. However, in recent years, molecular tests that provide fast and high-quality viral diagnosis information have started to take their place in laboratories. Syndrome-based PCR tests after PCR and multiplex PCR tests are also approaches that question the direct factor and accelerate the diagnosis and treatment. LAMP PCR technology has also developed rapidly, and the diagnosis time has been shortened in the field or at the bedside with very small portable devices. As a new technology, CRISPR diagnostic methods and portable DNA sequencing devices will be very useful in the diagnosis of viral infections in the clinic for rapid results per patient. With immunoprecipitation systems using luciferase-labeled antigens, virus identification, quantitation, antiviral efficacy can be monitored. COVID-19 outbreak management increased the need for very fast and reliable tests and triggered the laboratory biotechnology industry. The entire world is experiencing a dynamic pandemic process in which the benefits of new, highly sensitive, accessible and portable identification methods will be tested. The presence of a large number of applications in the approval process for these methods provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic algorithms will have richer and productive solutions in the near future. Experiences will be guiding in better understanding of other viral infections, establishing bedside diagnostic solutions, providing more effective treatments. © 2020 Gazi Universitesi.

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) significantly affected the health care systems in the world. The disease was accepted as COVID-19 pandemic by WHO. Diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 infection requires multidisciplinary management and there are currently many ongoing studies for possible vaccination and antiviral therapies for the treatment. The major symptoms are known to be high fever and dry cough. Moreover, new symptoms like olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are defined. The epithelium of upper respiratory tract and related cavities (ear, paranasal sinuses) are known to be reservoir for COVID19 virus. Therefore, otorhinolaryngology physicians are one of the highest risk groups for nosocomial transmission. The pandemic altered standard daily working schedule of otorhinolaryngology physicians in the world. Elective operations such as rhinologic and otological surgeries are suspended, and novel prevention strategies were developed to prevent nosocomial transmission during physical examination and surgery. However, the treatment of emergency diseases like deep neck infections, epistaxis, tracheostomy, and head and neck cancers are still going on as expected. COVID-19 associated ARDS is known to require prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. But at the moment, the postitive effects of performing tracheostomy is not clearly identified on the outcomes of COVID-19-affected patients. In this study we aimed to review the literature regarding COVID-19 from an otorhinolaryngology point of view. We wanted to show how the pandemic affected daily otorhinolaryngology practice including outpatient clinic, head and cancer treatment, tracheostomy, and otologic manifestations along with preventive measures. In addition, we aimed to emphasize olfactory and taste disturbances which are now included in the COVID19 symptoms. © 2020 Gazi Universitesi.

Communication efforts were maintained continuously during the epidemic to inform the public, raise awareness, take precautions and to eventually mitigate the pandemic so as to prevent the national health system from collapsing. Media played a key role as the public and health authorities disclosed information. Nevertheless, modern communication technologies and the infodemic spreading from social media hindered the communication of accurate information. Given the insufficient health literacy in Turkey, the rapidly changing and unstable pandemic environment resulted in information gaps and in overlooked information.

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive systems. Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV. The most common symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%). The best prevention is to avoid exposure. In addition, contact persons should be subjected to mandatory quarantine. COVID-19 patients should be treated in specialist centers. A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases. A lung-saving ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanically ventilated patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable to a significant number of cases. Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available. Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the new coronavirus pandemic. The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment. © 2020 Via Medica.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Healthcare; Medical stuff; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Symptoms; Treatment","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; azithromycin; beta interferon; chloroquine; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 7; lopinavir plus ritonavir; noradrenalin; tumor necrosis factor; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; acute respiratory failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; extracorporeal oxygenation; fever; hand disinfection; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus HKU1; Human coronavirus NL63; influenza; intensive care unit; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality rate; multiple organ failure; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; noninvasive ventilation; oxygen therapy; pneumonia; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; adverse event; artificial ventilation; Betacoronavirus; clinical decision making; clinical pathway; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; extracorporeal oxygenation; laboratory technique; mass communication; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; oxygen therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; patient selection; prognosis; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Decision-Making; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Combined Modality Therapy; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Pathways; Diffusion of Innovation; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Humans; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Respiration, Artificial; Risk Factors; Viral Vaccines","32286679","Cardiol.

The disease, named COVID-19, has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to critical, and for some patients the disease is even fatal. Apparently, being a child or being pregnant does not represent an additional risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this mini-review was to investigate what is in the scientific literature, so far, in regard to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data were obtained independently by the two authors, who carried out a systematic search in the PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases using the Medical Subject Heading terms “coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” and “vertical transmission.” Few studies about the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are found in the literature. In all case reports and case series, the mothers' infection occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy, there were no maternal deaths, and most neonates had a favorable clinical course. The virus was not detected in the neonate nasopharyngeal swab samples at birth, in the placenta, in the umbilical cord, in the amniotic fluid, in the breast milk or in the maternal vaginal swab samples in any of these articles. Only three papers reported neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is a bias that positive pharyngeal swab samples were collected at 36 h and on the 2nd, 4th, and 17th days of life. The possibility of intrauterine infection has been based mainly on the detection of IgM and IL-6 in the neonates' serum. In conclusion, to date, no convincing evidence has been found for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. © Copyright © 2020 Simões e Silva and Leal.","COVID-19; intrauterine infection; neonate; pregnant women; SARS-CoV-2; vertical transmission","immunoglobulin M; interleukin 6; amnion fluid; bibliographic database; breast milk; childbirth; Cochrane Library; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; Embase; human; intrauterine infection; maternal death; Medical Subject Headings; Medline; mother; newborn infection; newborn period; nonhuman; placenta; pregnant woman; publication bias; puerperal infection; Review; Scopus; serum; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; third trimester pregnancy; throat culture; umbilical cord; vagina smear; vertical transmission; virus transmission",,"Front.

The confirmed cases increased nationwide rapidly, in part due to the increased population mobility during the Chinese Lunar New Year festival. The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently named the novel coronavirus pneumonia Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and named the virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Soon, transmission from person to person was confirmed and the virus spread to many other countries. To date, many cases have been reported in the pediatric age group, most of which were from China. The management and treatment strategies have also been improved, which we believe would be helpful to pediatric series in other countries as well. However, the characteristics of neonatal and childhood infection still have not been evaluated in detail.

A great variety of symptoms associated with COVID-19 disease, ranging from mild to severe symptoms, eventually leading to death. Specific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR is the standard method to screen symptomatic people; however, asymptomatic subjects and subjects with undetectable viral load escape from the screening, contributing to viral spread. Currently, the lock down imposed by many governments is an important measure to contain the spread, as there is no specific antiviral therapy or a vaccine and the main treatments are supportive. Therefore, there is urgent need to characterize the virus and the viral-mediated responses, in order to develop specific diagnostic and therapeutic tools to prevent viral transmission and efficiently cure COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the current studies on two viral mediated-responses, specifically the cytokine storm occurring in a subset of patients and the antibody response triggered by the infection. Further studies are needed to explore both the dynamics and the mechanisms of the humoral immune response in COVID-19 patients, in order to guide future vaccine design and antibody-based therapies for the management of the disease. © Copyright © 2020 Siracusano, Pastori and Lopalco.","antibodies; COVID-19; cytokine storm; SARS-CoV-2; serological tests","colony stimulating factor 1; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; CXCL9 chemokine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; leronlimab; monocyte chemotactic protein 3; neutralizing antibody; scatter factor; virus vaccine; cytokine; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody detection; antibody response; antiviral therapy; bioinformatics; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hospitalization; human; humoral immunity; immunogenicity; nonhuman; randomized controlled trial (topic); real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; virus morphology; virus pathogenesis; virus transmission; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32574261","Front.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. Methods We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. Results We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. Conclusion While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies. While this review highlights major research gaps, it allows interested entities to build their own guidance. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies. The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified. Main body: Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75-7.54). No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures. Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles. The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material. Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures. A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection. Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission. Conclusion: Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating. Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus. Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence. Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk. © 2020 The Author(s).","Aerosol generating medical procedure; AGMP; COVID-19; ENT; Otolaryngology; Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery; Personal protective equipment; PPE","aerosol; breathing; cauterization; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; epidemic; health care personnel; human; outpatient; priority journal; Review; tracheobronchial toilet; tracheotomy; upper respiratory tract; virus load; virus transmission; adverse event; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; ear nose throat surgery; infection control; isolation and purification; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; protective equipment; respiratory system; virology; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory System; Viral Load","32393346","J.

Better approaches of diagnostics and medical facilities have helped some countries recover early. Previous exposures to epidemics have imparted lessons to handle such a pandemic with a high level of preparedness. The World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities are taking great efforts via efficient and impactful interventions to contain the virus. Diagnostic tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction are increasingly being used to confirm the diagnosis because testing biological samples for the presence of the virus is the definitive method to identify the disease, analyze the risk for transmission, and determine whether someone has been cured or not. It is also important to screen asymptomatic individuals to get the exact overview of the virus spread. Antibody detection plays a pivotal role in diagnosis; however, using it at the wrong time yields negative results and conveys dissenting opinion about the tests. Although the scaling up of testing has been significant, overall testing has been limited by the availability of diagnostics. Rapid diagnoses and discontinuation of transmission are keys to ending this pandemic. Diagnostics manufacturers are developing test kits and distributing them to different countries. Therefore, more than 500 commercial test kits for molecular- and immunoassays, most with Emergency Use Authorization, are now becoming available in the market. In this review, we discuss the importance of diagnostics, approaches of different countries toward the epidemic, global testing situation, and lessons to countries at the start of the epidemic for better preparedness. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Diagnosis; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Sensitivity; Specificity","China; community; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; Germany; human; India; Italy; Nigeria; nonhuman; pandemic; Peru; Review; Singapore; South Korea; United States; virus transmission",,"J.

COVID-19 is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading, rendering its early diagnosis of preeminent status. Researchers, medical specialists and organizations all over the globe have been working tirelessly to combat this virus and help in its containment. In this paper, a novel neural network called WisdomNet has been proposed, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. The WisdomNet uses the concept of 'Wisdom of Crowds' as its founding idea. It is a two-layered convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes chest x-ray images as input. Both layers of the proposed neural network consist of a number of neural networks each. The dataset used for this study consists of chest x-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients, compiled and shared by Dr. Cohen on GitHub, and the chest x-ray images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by viral and bacterial pneumonia were obtained from Kaggle. The network not only pinpoints the presence of COVID-19, but also gives the probability of the disease maturing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus, predicting the progression of the disease in the COVID-19 positive patients. The network also slender the occurrences of false negative cases by employing a high threshold value, thus aids in curbing the spread of the disease and gives an accuracy of 100% for successfully predicting COVID-19 among the chest x-rays of patients affected with COVID-19, bacterial and viral pneumonia. © 2020 The Author(s).","ARDS; Chest x-rays; Convolutional neural networks; COVID-19; WisdomNet","adult respiratory distress syndrome; bacterial pneumonia; clinical article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early diagnosis; false negative result; human; image analysis; lung; predictive value; probability; prognosis; prospective study; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; WisdomNet",,"J.

In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19. Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; macrophage inflammatory protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; retinoic acid inducible protein I; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; autopsy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical feature; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; critical illness; cytokine storm; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; epidemic; human; hypertension; hypotension; hypothesis; immune response; lymphocytopenia; medical research; Note; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; receptor upregulation; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; virus entry; Betacoronavirus; blood clotting disorder; complication; Coronavirus infection; endothelium; epithelium; immunology; inflammation; lung; macrophage; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; sepsis; severity of illness index; shock; virology; virus pneumonia; Autopsy; Betacoronavirus; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Cytokines; Endothelium; Epithelium; Humans; Inflammation; Lung; Macrophages; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sepsis; Severity of Illness Index; Shock","32311318","Lancet",Note,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083509162

METHODS: We conducted a selective literature review to identify the indicators used and to derive appropriate definitions. We calculated crude and age-adjusted indicators for selected countries. RESULTS: The proportion of deaths (case fatality proportion [CFP]; number of deaths/ total number of cases) is commonly used to estimate the severity of a disease. If the CFP is used for purposes of comparison, the existence of heterogeneity in the detection and registration of cases and deaths has to be taken into account. In the early phase of an epidemic, when case numbers rise rapidly, the CFP suffers from bias. For these reasons, variants have been proposed: the ""confirmed CFP"" (number of deaths/total number of confirmed cases), and the ""delay-adjusted CFP,"" which considers the delay between infection with the disease and death from the disease. The indicator mortality (number of deaths/total population) has at first sight the advantage of being based on a defined denominator, the total population. During the outbreak of a disease, however, the cumulative deaths rise while the total population remains stable. The phase of the epidemic therefore has to be considered when using this indicator. In this context, R0 and R(t) are important indicators. R0 estimates the maximum rate of spread of a disease in a population, while R(t) describes the dynamics of the epidemic at a given time. Age-adjusted analysis of the CFP shows that the differences between countries decrease but do not dis - appear completely. If the test strategies depend on age or symptom severity, however, the bias cannot be entirely eliminated. CONCLUSION: Various indicators of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic at population level are used in daily communication.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential for HCWs to recognize which procedures are potentially aerosolizing so that appropriate infection prevention precautions can be taken. The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. Methods: A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. Results: Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue. Tracheal procedures like tracheostomy and endotracheal suctioning can also result in airborne transmission via small virus containing aerosols. © 2020 The Author(s).","Aerosol; Aerosolization; COVID-19; Guideline; Review","aerosol; cauterization; coronavirus disease 2019; endoscopy; evidence based medicine; head and neck surgery; human; laser surgery; priority journal; Review; tracheobronchial toilet; tracheostomy; virus transmission; adverse event; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; devices; disease transmission; ear nose throat disease; ear nose throat surgery; infection control; isolation and purification; pandemic; practice guideline; prevention and control; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic","32375884","J.

On March 11 2020, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 infection to be a pandemic, based on the involvement of 169 nations. Specific drugs for SARS-CoV-2 are obviously not available. Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data. In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses. An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2. This can accelerate the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, hopefully, of future pandemics due to other emerging zoonotic RNA viruses. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"antivirus agent; favipiravir; nhc eidd 1931; remdesivir; RNA directed RNA polymerase; sofosbuvir; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; RNA directed RNA polymerase; amino acid sequence; antiviral therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; enzyme structure; human; humoral immunity; nonhuman; pandemic; Review; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication; virus transcription; virus transmission; zoonosis; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; conserved sequence; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; enzymology; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; sequence alignment; virology; virus pneumonia; virus shedding; Amino Acid Sequence; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Conserved Sequence; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA Replicase; Sequence Alignment; Virus Replication; Virus Shedding","32370758","J.

Even though multiple vaccines and treatments are under development so far, the disease is only slowing down under extreme social distancing measures that are difficult to maintain. SARS-COV-2 is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store. The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis. Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. In this review, we discuss the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection as well as the possibility of targeting lipid metabolism to interfere with the viral life cycle. © 2020 by the authors.

This is due to the highly infectious nature of the disease and its possibility to cause pneumonia induced death in approximately 6.89% of infected individuals (data until 27 April 2020). The pathogen causing COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to be originated from the Wuhan Province in China. Unfortunately, an effective and approved vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not available, making the situation more dangerous and currently available medical care futile. This unmet medical need thus requires significant and very urgent research attention to develop an effective vaccine to address the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this review, the state-of-the-art drug design strategies against the virus are critically summarized including exploitations of novel drugs and potentials of repurposed drugs. The applications of nanochemistry and general nanotechnology was also discussed to give the status of nanodiagnostic systems for COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","MERS-CoV; nucleic acid testing; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV); serological testing; specimen collection","virus RNA; primer DNA; ribonuclease P; virus antibody; blood sampling; feces analysis; human; laboratory test; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; practice guideline; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus inactivation; volume; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; genetics; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; SARS coronavirus; serology; virology; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; DNA Primers; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribonuclease P; SARS Virus; Serologic Tests","32302058","Rev.

However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features.

Despite global efforts to contain the disease spread, the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection. This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature. Dental professionals, including endodontists, may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection.

By Feb. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.

This disease called COVID-19 classified as a public health emergency by the WHO has impacted our professional practice leading to major changes for an unknown duration. Even if we know part of the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2, (viral replication cycle, parameters and dynamics of transmissibility), in the absence of specific treatment, this paucy-symptomatic respiratory infection in the vast majority of cases, leads to mortality in about 1% of the cases and a morbidity of 10%. This resulted in a deep tension of our healthcare system. The diagnosis is based on the association of clinical signs of low respiratory infection and direct detection of the virus by PCR or indirect radiological pulmonary lesions. Very symptomatic and severe forms most often require hospital treatment. Once the diagnosis has been made, management is based on the recognition of severe cases and on symptomatic therapeutic measures: oxygenation, antibiotic therapy to prevent secondary infection, anticoagulation and hydration. Anti-viral treatments and immune-modulators for the second phase of the disease linked to a cytokine storm are being evaluated. Prevention is an essential element using specific patient path, protection of patients and caregivers by “droplets” and “contact” isolation (mask, personal hygiene, hydro-alcoholic solution) and physical and social distancing. These measures aim to counterbalance the saturation of the healthcare system by reducing epidemic peaks. Vaccination is expected since it appears as in the final issue of this disease. © 2020 John Libbey Eurotext.

Indeed, there is urgent need to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodologies not only to use in health laboratory environments but also directly in places where humans circulate and spread the virus such as airports, trains, boats, and any public aggregation places. The success of a reliable and sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis relies on the identification and measurement of informative biomarkers from human host and virus in a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive manner.

Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.

Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus). Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions.

The impact is far-reaching, with enforced social distancing and isolation, detrimental effects on individual physical activity and mental wellbeing, education in the young and economic impact to business. Whilst most COVID-19 patients demonstrate mild-to-moderate symptoms, those with severe disease progression are at a higher risk of mortality. As more is learnt about this novel disease, it is becoming evident that comorbid cardiovascular disease is associated with a greater severity and increased mortality. Many patients positive for COVID-19 demonstrate increased concentrations of cardiac troponin, creating confusion in clinical interpretation. While myocardial infarction is associated with acute infectious respiratory disease, the majority of COVID-19 patients demonstrate stable cTn rather than the dynamically changing values indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. Although full understanding of the mechanism of cTn release in COVID-19 is currently lacking, this mini-review assesses the limited published literature with a view to offering insight to pathophysiological mechanisms and reported treatment regimens. © The Author(s) 2020.","analytes; cardiac troponin I; cardiac troponin T; Covid-19; SARS-Cov-2; Troponin","dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; troponin; biological marker; troponin; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease transmission; epidemic; heart infarction; incubation time; infection risk; laboratory test; myocarditis; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein secretion; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomarkers; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Troponin","32255359","Ann.

The extremely rapid international spread of the disease with significant morbidity and mortality made finding possible therapeutic interventions a global priority. While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients. Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment. Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies. While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary. Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rationalise the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors","Chloroquine; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2","chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; antimalarial agent; antivirus agent; hydroxychloroquine; abdominal discomfort; animal model; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; cardiomyopathy; cardiotoxicity; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug use; eye toxicity; fulminant hepatic failure; gastrointestinal symptom; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; infection prevention; multicenter study (topic); myopathy; nausea; neurological complication; nonhuman; ototoxicity; pandemic; pharmacokinetic parameters; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; toxic epidermal necrolysis; urticaria; virus infection; vomiting; animal; Betacoronavirus; bioavailability; blood; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; half life time; physiology; treatment outcome; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Animals; Antimalarials; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Biological Availability; Coronavirus Infections; Half-Life; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Treatment Outcome; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication","32387694","Travel Med.

Studies have identified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 was found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. These suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can actively infect and replicate in the gastrointestinal tract. This has important implications to the disease management, transmission, and infection control.

Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively. Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments. © 2020 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery","COVID-19; Oral and maxillofacial surgery; Pandemic; Personal protective equipment; SARS-CoV-2; Triage","Cinahl; conservative treatment; coronavirus disease 2019; cross infection; elective surgery; Embase; emergency surgery; hand washing; health care policy; health care system; human; infection risk; maxillofacial surgery; Medline; outpatient care; outpatient department; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; aerosol; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; infection control; laboratory technique; oral surgery; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Surgery, Oral","32303420","J.

Thus, all countries are employing a lot of resources in order to test more and more subjects. For this purpose, there are different strategies, based on either direct or indirect tests. Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed. In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed.

A structured review was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and ophthalmology. The Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet was used for quality assessments. 1018 items were identified in the search; 26 records were included in the qualitative synthesis, which encompassed 6 literature reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case reports, and 6 intervention descriptions. Seventeen out of 26 records (65%) were categorized as level 5 within the Oxford CBME methodology grading system, the rest were level 4. The evidence generated on COVID-19 and ophthalmology to date is limited, although this is understandable given the circumstances. Both the possible presence of viral particles in tears and conjunctiva, and the potential for conjunctival transmission remain controversial. Ocular manifestations are not frequent and could resemble viral infection of the ocular surface. Most recommendations are based on the strategies implemented by Asian countries during previous coronavirus outbreaks. There is a need for substantive studies evaluating these strategies in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. In the meantime, plans for applying these measures must be implemented with caution, taking into account the context of each individual country, and undergo regular evaluation. © 2019 Conselho Brasileiro De Oftalmologia.","Conjunctiva; COVID-19; Ocular; Ophthalmology; SARS-CoV-2","complication; conjunctiva; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; evidence based medicine; eye disease; human; lacrimal fluid; literature; ophthalmology; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus pneumonia; Conjunctiva; Coronavirus Infections; Evidence-Based Medicine; Eye Diseases; Humans; Ophthalmology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Review Literature as Topic; Tears","32490972","Arq.

The cluster was largely associated with a seafood and animal market. A novel Betacoronavirus was quickly identified as the causative agent, and it is shown to be related genetically to SARS-CoV and other bat-borne SARS-related Betacoronaviruses. The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to other provinces in China, as well as to another four countries. To help control the spread of the virus, a “cordon sanitaire” was instituted for Wuhan on January 23, 2020, and subsequently extended to other cities in Hubei Province, and the outbreak declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the Director General of the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This article described the evolution of the outbreak, and the known properties of the novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease it causes, and the major public health measures being used to help control it’s spread. These measures include social distancing, intensive surveillance and quarantining of cases, contact tracing and isolation, cancellation of mass gatherings, and community containment. The virus is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but appears to be the only one with pandemic potential. However, a number of important properties of the virus are still not well understood, and there is an urgent need to learn more about its transmission dynamics, its spectrum of clinical severity, its wildlife origin, and its genetic stability. In addition, more research is needed on possible interventions, particularly therapeutic and vaccines. © 2020 APJPH.","clinical signs; COVID-19; diagnostic tests; human infection; public health measures","animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; pandemic; public health; virus pneumonia; World Health Organization; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; World Health Organization; Zoonoses","32475144","Asia-Pac.

Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients. Recent Findings: The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions. Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes. To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately. Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy. Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease. Summary: In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ACE2; ARDS; Cancer; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Immune response; Pandemic; Pneumonia; SARS; SARS-CoV-2","alpha2b interferon; anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; arbidol; azithromycin; baricitinib; bevacizumab; camostat mesilate; CD24Fc; chloroquine; cobicistat plus darunavir; colchicine; deferoxamine; dexamethasone; emapalumab; favipiravir; fingolimod; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; leronlimab; lisinopril; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; methylprednisolone; nitric oxide; nivolumab; oseltamivir; ruxolitinib; unindexed drug; valsartan; antivirus agent; age; cancer patient; China; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; early diagnosis; early intervention; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; immune response; malignant neoplasm; medical research; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; mortality rate; pandemic; pathogenesis; patient care; plasma transfusion; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus entry; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; hospital mortality; immunocompromised patient; immunology; neoplasm; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors","32385672","Curr.

Coronavirus outbreak was first reported towards the end of 2019 and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Worldwide countries are responding differently to the virus outbreak. A delay in detection and response has been recorded in China, as well as in other major countries, which led to an overburdening of the local health systems. On the other hand, some other nations have put in place effective strategies to contain the infection and have recorded a very low number of cases since the beginning of the pandemics. Restrictive measures like social distancing, lockdown, case detection, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of exposed had revealed the most efficient actions to control the disease spreading. This review will help the readers to understand the difference in response by different countries and their outcomes. Based on the experience of these countries, India responded to the pandemic accordingly. Only time will tell how well India has faced the outbreak.

Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay, which is used in &gt;30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp-P2-negative specimens (119/ 273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P &lt; 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21×104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21×102 to 4.71×105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.

The pandemic has the potential to differentially disadvantage chronically ill patients, including those with Parkinson's disease (PD). The first health care reaction has been to limit access to clinics and neurology wards to preserve fragile patients with PD from being infected. In some regions, the shortage of medical staff has also forced movement disorders neurologists to provide care for patients with COVID-19. Objective: To share the experience of various movement disorder neurologists operating in different world regions and provide a common approach to patients with PD, with a focus on those already on advanced therapies, which may serve as guidance in the current pandemic and for emergency situations that we may face in the future. Conclusion: Most of us were unprepared to deal with this condition given that in many health care systems, telemedicine has been only marginally available or only limited to email or telephone contacts. In addition, to ensure sufficient access to intensive care unit beds, most elective procedures (including deep brain stimulation or the initiation of infusion therapies) have been postponed. We all hope there will soon be a time when we will return to more regular hospital schedules. However, we should consider this crisis as an opportunity to change our approach and encourage our hospitals and health care systems to facilitate the remote management of chronic neurological patients, including those with advanced PD. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society","advanced therapies; COVID-19; Parkinson's disease; SARS-CoV-2; telemedicine","apomorphine; carbidopa plus levodopa; anticoagulant therapy; brain depth stimulation; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; electroencephalogram; health care system; human; intensive care unit; morbidity; mortality risk; multiple organ failure; pandemic; Parkinson disease; patient care; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; telemedicine; treatment withdrawal; videoconferencing",,"Mov.

For urologists, it has affected and will continue to influence how we approach the care of patients preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. A risk-benefit assessment of each patient undergoing surgery should be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the urgency of the surgery and the risk of viral illness and transmission. Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality. Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect health care workers and ensure an adequate workforce. For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available. The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus. Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures for COVID-19 positive patients or when COVID status is unknown. Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization. Ultra-low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission. Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures. COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection. Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced. Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","coronavirus; COVID-19; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; surgery; urology","ambient air; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; disinfection; emergency health service; endoscopy; health care personnel; human; incidence; laparoscopic surgery; mortality; open surgery; pandemic; peroperative care; postoperative care; preoperative care; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; Review; robot assisted surgery; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; urologic surgery; workflow; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; infection control; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; protective equipment; urologic surgery; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Endoscopy; Humans; Infection Control; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Preoperative Care; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Triage; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Workflow","32336150","J.

The sheer scale and severity of this pandemic is unprecedented in the modern era. Although primarily a respiratory tract infection transmitted by direct contact and droplets, during aerosol-generating procedures, there is a possibility of airborne transmission. In addition, emerging evidence suggests possible fecal–oral spread of the virus. Clinical departments that perform endoscopy are faced with daunting challenges during this pandemic. To date, multiple position statements and guidelines have been issued by various professional organizations to recommend practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to summarize and discuss available evidence for these practices, to provide guidance for endoscopy to enhance patient safety, avoid nosocomial outbreaks, protect healthcare personnel, and ensure rational use of personal protective equipment. Responses adapted to national recommendations and local infection control guidelines and tailored to the availability of medical resources are imminently needed to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. © 2020 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Endoscopy; Infection prevention and control; Pandemic; Personal protective equipment; PPE; SARS-CoV-2","aerosol; bronchoscopy; colonoscopy; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cross infection; disease severity; disinfection; emergency health service; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic ultrasonography; endoscopy; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; high risk patient; hospital infection; human; infection control; infection prevention; laryngoscopy; medical society; nonhuman; pandemic; patient safety; practice guideline; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; waste management; World Health Organization; adverse event; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; endoscopy; gastrointestinal endoscopy; hospital subdivisions and components; organization and management; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; virus pneumonia; Aerosols; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Endoscopy; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Hospital Units; Humans; Infection Control; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic","32233034","J.

Maximal precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by most nations in war footing to mitigate transmission and decrease fatality rates. This article was aimed to review the evidence on clinical management and to deal with the identification of high-risk groups, warning signs, appropriate investigations, proper sample collection for confirmation, general and specific treatment measures, strategies as well as infection control in the healthcare settings. Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage. Among the currently available drugs, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, awaiting further clinical trials. Stringent droplet and contact precautions will protect healthcare workers against most clinical exposures to COVID-19.

Aims: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID-19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission. Methods: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID-19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. Results: With an incidence of 3% (1/41)-79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)-50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)-49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)-66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)-29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)-6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)-13.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)-15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)-66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)-53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2-5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)-82% (54/66) patients for 1-11 days. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.

Dental practices are focal points for cross-infection, and care must be taken to minimise the risk of infection to, from, or between dental care professionals and patients. The COVID-19 epidemiological and clinical characteristics are still being collated but children's symptoms seem to be milder than those that adults experience. It is unknown whether certain groups, for example children with comorbidities, might be at a higher risk of more severe illness. Emerging data on disease spread in children, affected by COVID-19, have not been presented in detail. The purpose of this article was to report current data on the paediatric population affected with COVID-19 and highlight considerations for dentists providing care for children during this pandemic. All members of the dental team have a professional responsibility to keep themselves informed of current guidance and be vigilant in updating themselves as recommendations are changing so quickly. © 2020 BSPD, IAPD and John Wiley & Sons A/S.

There is currently a lack of nonspecific laboratory indicators as a quantitative standard to distinguish between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and an influenza A or B virus infection. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to detect COVID-19. Methods. A nomogram was established using data collected from 457 patients (181 with COVID-19 and 276 with influenza A or B infection) in China. The nomogram used age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Results. Our nomogram predicted probabilities of COVID-19 with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883-0.937), greater than that of the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio (0.849; 95% CI, 0.812-0.880; P = .0007), lymphocyte percentage (0.808; 95% CI, 0.768-0.843; P < .0001), monocyte count (0.780; 95% CI, 0.739-0.817; P < .0001), or age (0.656; 95% CI, 0.610-0.699; P < .0001). The predicted probability conformed to the real observation outcomes of COVID-19, according to the calibration curves. Conclusions. We found that age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count are risk factors for the early-stage prediction of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus. As such, our research provides a useful test for doctors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. © The Author(s) 2020.","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Differentiating; Influenza; Nomogram","adolescent; adult; age; aged; area under the curve; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; infection risk; influenza A; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza A virus (H7N9); influenza B; lymphocyte monocyte ratio; lymphocyte percentage; major clinical study; male; monocyte count; neutrophil count; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nomogram; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; Review; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus detection",,"Open Forum Infect.

The routes of transmission are direct contact, and droplet and possible aerosol transmissions. Due to the unique nature of dentistry, most dental procedures generate significant amounts of droplets and aerosols, posing potential risks of infection transmission. Understanding the significance of aerosol transmission and its implications in dentistry can facilitate the identification and correction of negligence in daily dental practice.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS","alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; ascorbic acid; chloroquine; cinanserin; cyclosporine; diarylheptanoid derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; emodin; flavonoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monoclonal antibody; nelfinavir; nicotianamine; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; promazine; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; selenium; thymopentin; thymosin alpha1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin B group; zinc; COVID-19; immunologic factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trace element; virus vaccine; vitamin; antiviral therapy; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; human; infection control; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; nutritional status; passive immunization; pathogenicity; plasma; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunologic Factors; Nutritional Status; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Trace Elements; Viral Vaccines; Vitamins","32052466","J.

In each section, we note the nature and quality of prior research, including uncertainty and unsettled issues.

As knowledge about the disease epidemiology and clinical profile is rapidly evolving, we are still not sure about many different aspects of the disease transmission and presentation. Otolaryngologists regularly deal with the upper aerodigestive tract, which is the portal of transmission and site of multiplication of the virus. There is a substantial risk of getting infected and transmitting the disease further. We discuss the various recommendations pertaining to the emergency and elective procedures in otolaryngology, and head and neck surgeries in these difficult times, so as to sensitise the clinicians while dealing with such cases, till the pandemic is under control and things get back to normal. © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association.

As this was a current study, there are still not many sources in the literature, and scientific strategies are moving towards therapy and diagnosis, rather than knowing the characteristics of the virus.

Non-invasive monitoring is also extremely necessary in situations where it is difficult to use complicated wired connections, such as ECG monitoring for infants, burn victims or during rescue missions when people are buried during building collapses/earthquakes. Due to the unique characteristics such as higher penetration capabilities, extremely precise ranging, low power requirement, low cost, simple hardware and robustness to multipath interferences, Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) technology is appropriate for non-invasive medical applications. IR-UWB sensors detect the macro as well as micro movement inside the human body due to its fine range resolution. The two vital signs, i.e., respiration rate and heart rate, can be measured by IR-UWB radar by measuring the change in the magnitude of signal due to displacement caused by human lungs, heart during respiration and heart beating. This paper reviews recent advances in IR-UWB radar sensor design for healthcare, such as vital signs measurements of a stationary human, vitals of a non-stationary human, vital signs of people in a vehicle, through the wall vitals measurement, neonate’s health monitoring, fall detection, sleep monitoring and medical imaging. Although we have covered many topics related to health monitoring using IR-UWB, this paper is mainly focused on signal processing techniques for measurement of vital signs, i.e., respiration and heart rate monitoring. © 2020 by the authors.","Algorithm; Fall detection; Heart rate; IR-UWB radar; Motion detection; Respiration rate; Sleep monitoring; Vital signs","Biomedical signal processing; Health; Heart; Impulse noise; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Radar measurement; Radar signal processing; Radio; Radio transceivers; Remote patient monitoring; Building collapse; Health monitoring; Heart-rate monitoring; Impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB); Multi-path interference; Non-invasive monitoring; Remote health monitoring; Signal processing technique; Ultra-wideband (UWB); breathing rate; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; devices; heart rate; human; pandemic; physiologic monitoring; procedures; radiofrequency radiation; signal processing; telecommunication; telemedicine; theoretical model; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Heart Rate; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radar; Radio Waves; Respiratory Rate; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Telemedicine","32349382","Sensors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084170606

Diagnosis was confirmed either by DENV–specific real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT–PCR), or non–structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; a case fatality rate of 0.4% (10/3994) was observed. The prevalence rate of dengue fever (DF) varied from 27.5 to 453.9 cases per 100,000 population among febrile patients who sought medical attention annually. DF cases occurred throughout the year with low level of transmission observed during the dry season (December to June), then increased transmission during rainy season (July to November) peaking in October. Three major dengue epidemics occurred in Barbados during 2010, 2013 and possibly 2016 with an emerging three–year interval. DF prevalence rate among febrile patients who sought medical attention overall was highest among the 10–19 years old age group. The highest DF hospitalisation prevalence rate was observed in 2013. Multiple serotypes circulated during the study period and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV–2) was the most prevalent serotype during 2010, whilst DENV–1 was the most prevalent serotype in 2013. Two DENV–1 strains from the 2013 DENV epidemic were genetically more closely related to South East Asian strains, than Caribbean or South American strains, and represent the first ever sequencing of DENV strains in Barbados. However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions. DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males. Public health planning should consider DENV inter–epidemic periodicity, the current COVID–19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID–19. The implementation of routine sequencing of DENV strains to obtain critical data can aid in battling DENV epidemics in Barbados. © 2020 by the authors.","Arbovirus; Barbados; Caribbean; Dengue; DENV; Epidemics; Epidemiology; Genetic sequencing; Public health; Severe dengue","immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; nonstructural protein 1; adolescent; adult; anorexia; arthralgia; Barbados; Caribbean; case fatality rate; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; dengue; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; dry season; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; groups by age; headache; health care planning; hepatomegaly; high throughput sequencing; human; jaundice; major clinical study; male; myalgia; prevalence; rainy season; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; serotype; severe dengue; South American; thrombocytopenia",,"Trop.

Influenza virus due to its wide host range and zoonotic potential poses such a significant threat to public health. Swine serve as a “mixing vessel” for influenza virus reassortment and evolution which as a result may facilitate the emergence of new strains or subtypes of zoonotic potential. In this context, the currently available scientific data hold a high significance to unravel influenza virus epidemiology and evolution. With this objective, the current systematic review summarizes the original research articles and case reports of all the four types of influenza viruses reported in swine populations worldwide. A total of 281 articles were found eligible through screening of PubMed and Google Scholar databases and hence were included in this systematic review. The highest number of research articles (n = 107) were reported from Asia, followed by Americas (n = 97), Europe (n = 55), Africa (n = 18), and Australia (n = 4). The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common influenza A virus subtypes reported in swine in most countries across the globe, however, few strains of influenza B, C, and D viruses were also reported in certain countries. Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine. Interspecies transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics. © 2020 by the authors.

The causative agent of COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease rapidly spreads from China to the world by trading and traveling. Until April 24, 2020, approximately 2,544,792 cases were confirmed with 175,694 deaths throughout the world. The highest number of cases were identified from the United States of America (USA) whereas the mortality rate is high in Portugal. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on Computed Tomography Scanning (CT Scan) and Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Assessing the extension of pathology, the exact location of the area involved, and assessment of the disease severity makes CT scan superior to other modalities. This review shows that real-time polymerase chain reaction and imaging technology both play an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, imaging modalities have more importance in diagnosis and screening than qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR was positive in 81.3% whereas CT scan abnormality was observed in 89.8%. Bilateral lobe (51.4%) abnormality was found more than a single lobe (21.5%) in COVID-19 infected patients. The CT scan reports show a high-level abnormality in right lower lung lobe than others in COVID-19 infected patients. The CT scan evaluates different manifestations such as the presence of ground-glass opacities, consolidations, crazy paying linear, cavitation, discrete nodules, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. It is concluded that imaging technology especially CT scan and X-rays play an important role in the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients in limited access to qRT-PCR regions. The common radiological manifestation was also determined, which will be helpful for the radiologist to diagnosed COVID-19 infected patients in the early stages. Follow up studies required regarding the radiological examinations. © 2020 The Author(s).","Computed tomography scanning; Consolidation; COVID-19; Ground glass opacity; Real-time polymerase chain reaction","clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; differential diagnosis; human; lung lobe; lymphadenopathy; mortality; pleura effusion; radiodiagnosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; thorax radiography; x-ray computed tomography",,"J.

Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings. While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs. © Copyright © 2020 Nelson, Rath, Fragkou, Antalis, Tsiodras and Skevaki.","bedside testing; biosensors; commercial point-of-care tests; innovative approaches; POCT; virus diagnostics","futurology; human; laboratory test; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; point of care testing; research priority; respiratory virus; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral respiratory tract infection; virus detection; virus diagnosis; communicable disease; genetic procedures; isolation and purification; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; respiratory tract infection; RNA virus; virology; DNA virus; Biosensing Techniques; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; DNA Viruses; Humans; Point-of-Care Testing; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Tract Infections; RNA Viruses","32411619","Front.

Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).","COVID-19; Delirium; Pain; Pandemic; PICS; PTSD; SARS-CoV-2; Sedation","sedative agent; arousal; breathing; central nervous system; coronavirus disease 2019; family attitude; human; intensive care psychosis; mobilization; nonhuman; pain assessment; pandemic; physiotherapy; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; screening; sedation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; delirium; intensive care unit; pandemic; safety; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delirium; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Safety","32345343","Crit.

It has peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and is a receptor for cyclosporin A (CsA). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Seven types of coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans, among which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are fatal for humans. It is well established that CypA is essential for the replication of various coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and FCoV. Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses. These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases. In view of this, we describe the effects of CypA on the replication of coronaviruses and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors, which will provide the scientific basis and ideas for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, Science Press.

Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the crucial interventions to control virus spread and dissemination. Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals. However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results. As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments.

Multiple ongoing clinical trials for vaccines and antivirals against CoVs showcase the availability of medical interventions to both prevent and treat the future emergence of highly pathogenic CoVs in human. However, given the diverse nature of CoVs and our close interactions with wild, domestic and companion animals, the next epidemic zoonotic CoV could resist the existing vaccines and antivirals developed, which are primarily focused on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV). In late 2019, the novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing global public health concern. In this review, we will summarize the key advancements of current vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as discuss the challenge and opportunity in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis. At the end, we advocate the development of a “plug-and-play” platform technologies that could allow quick manufacturing and administration of broad-spectrum countermeasures in an outbreak setting. We will discuss the potential of AAV-based gene therapy technology for in vivo therapeutic antibody delivery to combat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the future emergence of severe CoVs. © Copyright © 2020 Tse, Meganck, Graham and Baric.","2019 nCoV; adeno-associate virus; antivirals; coronavirus (CoV); MERS- and SARS-CoV; passive immunization strategy; vaccine","4 [(5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 5,5,8,8 tetramethyl 2 naphthyl)carboxamido]benzoic acid; adeno associated virus vector; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; cathepsin L; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; inactivated vaccine; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; live vaccine; lopinavir; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; ribavirin; ritonavir; ssaa09e1; trypsin like serine protease; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; virus spike protein; virus vaccine; [1 [(1 formyl 2 phenylethyl)carbamoyl] 2 methylpropyl]carbamic acid benzyl ester; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine release; drug development; gene mutation; gene therapy; human; humoral immunity; immune response; immunomodulation; lipogenesis; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; passive immunization; quarantine; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load",,"Front.

Nucleic acid detection, as the definite diagnosis tool, plays an important role in rapid diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, epidemic prevention and control. However, the disease is outbreak, and the time of nucleic acid detection in clinical application is short. So the insufficient method verification and clinical evaluation has been made. ""False negative"" is observed in clinical practice, and the result of nucleic acid detection is not matched with the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is urgent to optimize the current methods and improve detection sensitivity.

While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2. Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy. Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Given that several currently marketed drugs may be efficient therapeutic agents for severe COVID-19 cases, they may be beneficial for future viral pandemics and other infections caused by RNA viruses when standard treatments are unavailable. © 2020 by the authors.

In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 meters (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 meters from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 meters from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities. © 2020 by the authors.

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing. COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.

The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections—SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012—both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas.

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies. In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions. © 2020 by the authors.

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development: Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion: Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Neurología","Central nervous system; Coronavirus; MERS-CoV; Mouse hepatitis virus; Multiple sclerosis; Neurological symptoms; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2","coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; multiple sclerosis; neurologic disease; nonhuman; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal; Betacoronavirus; central nervous system; complication; Coronavirus infection; disease model; mouse; pandemic; pathophysiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Central Nervous System; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Mice; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32299636","Neurologia",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083179688

The disease has been referred to as COVID-19, and the causative agent has been labelled SARS-CoV-2 due to its genetic similarities to the virus (SARS-CoV-1) responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic nearly 20 years earlier. The spike proteins of both viruses dictate tissue tropism using the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE-2) receptor to bind to cells. The ACE-2 receptor can be found in nervous system tissue and endothelial cells among the tissues of many other organs. Neurological complications have been observed with COVID-19. Myalgia and headache are relatively common, but serious neurological disease appears to be rare. No part of the neuraxis is spared. The neurological disorders occurring with COVID-19 may have many pathophysiological underpinnings. Some appear to be the consequence of direct viral invasion of the nervous system tissue, others arise as a postviral autoimmune process, and still others are the result of metabolic and systemic complications due to the associated critical illness. This review addresses the preliminary observations regarding the neurological disorders reported with COVID-19 to date and describes some of the disorders that are anticipated from prior experience with similar coronaviruses. © 2020, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Encephalitis; Meningitis; Myositis; Neurological complications; SARS-CoV-2; Stroke","acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; acute inflammatory demyelinating peripheral neuropathy; ageusia; anosmia; autoimmune disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; encephalitis; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; human; meningitis; myalgia; myositis; neurologic disease; neurological complication; nonhuman; peripheral neuropathy; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; cerebrovascular accident; complication; Coronavirus infection; genetics; headache; host pathogen interaction; meningitis; metabolism; myalgia; myositis; nervous system; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; virology; virus encephalitis; virus entry; virus pneumonia; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; protein binding; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus receptor; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Encephalitis, Viral; Headache; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Meningitis; Myalgia; Myositis; Nervous System; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Receptors, Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Stroke; Virus Internalization","32447630","J.

The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 employ real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours. But the assay duration has been shortened to 45 min by Cepheid. Of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay by Abbott that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min. Most molecular tests have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) and are Conformité Européenne (CE) marked. A wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), manual ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulinM(IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ongoing research efforts and advances in complementary technologies will pave the way to new POC IVD assays in the coming months.

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 disease which may present with mild, moderate, or severe illness. In severe cases, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock can occur. Individuals above 60 years and people with preexisting comorbidities are at higher risk for developing serious complications. The incubation period of this new pathogen ranges from 1 to 14 days and there is no preexisting immunity to the disease. Countries across the globe have adopted various prevention and control measures to minimize negative health impacts. India has adopted various public health measures which include social distancing measures, nationwide lockdown to reduce risk of exposure, widespread IEC messaging regarding hand-washing, usage of masks, and recommending avoidance of unnecessary travel to combat the spread of disease.

Children appear to develop moderate-mild or silent forms of the disease; to our knowledge, only two cases of death (a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old teenagers) have been reported. Arguably, the number of pediatric cases may be underestimated, since presumably cases with mild or no symptoms are not brought to the doctor's attention. We have selected the most interesting and significant papers (including some prepublication or ahead-of-print papers).

As the epidemic has spread, similar cases have also been found in other parts of mainland China and abroad. The main reason for this spread is the highly contagious nature of the virus and the fact that children can also become infected during its incubation period. This has made the virus a substantial challenge for the outpatient triage staff of children's hospitals outside the epidemic area of the Hubei Province. It is very important for the preview and triage personnel to accurately grasp the epidemiology of the virus and identify children's symptoms in the fever clinic. Methods: We performed an analysis of our early preview and triage of suspected COVID-19 in 36 children presenting at fever clinics. Two specialists either excluded suspected cases or referred cases to the isolation ward for new nucleic acid testing. Results: All 14 children who were transferred to the isolation ward had a fever, and 71.43% of them had a cough. Their nucleic acid testing results were negative. The suspected cases and excluded suspected cases had similar epidemiology history as well as complete blood count results. With reference to the diagnostic criteria in existing pediatric guidelines, we have further improved the triage screening questionnaire for children with fever in our hospital. Conclusions: According to the situation in our city and hospital, an evaluation questionnaire that is suitable for use with children in our hospital has been formulated to achieve the goals of early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment. We provided an important basis for the next step in developing accurate preview and triage screening standards and appropriate guidelines for pediatric patients. © Translational Pediatrics.

For this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used. Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment. Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2-positive patients. Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2 patients should be considered.

The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in China, which causes COVID-19 disease in humans, and its current spread to several countries, leading to the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus, highlights the significance of zoonotic viral diseases. Rift Valley fever, rabies, West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and influenza viruses among many other viruses have been reported from different African countries. The paucity of information, lack of knowledge, limited resources, and climate change, coupled with cultural traditions make the African continent a hotspot for vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases, which may spread globally. Currently, there is no information available on the status of virus diseases in Africa. This systematic review highlights the available information about viral diseases, including zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, reported in Africa. The findings will help us understand the trend of emerging and re-emerging virus diseases within the African continent. The findings recommend active surveillance of viral diseases and strict implementation of One Health measures in Africa to improve human public health and reduce the possibility of potential pandemics due to zoonotic viruses. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection. © 2020 Xi'an Jiaotong University","Coronavirus; Isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based methods; Microarray-based methods; Nucleic acid detection; PCR-Based methods","CRISPR associated enzyme Cas13; CRISPR associated protein; unclassified drug; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; coronavirus disease 2019; DNA microarray; human; loop mediated isothermal amplification; molecular diagnosis; nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; nucleic acid analysis; polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification; Review; rolling circle amplification; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"J.

Outpatient clinics need to strengthen the differential diagnosis of initial symptoms, pulmonary ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, interstitial and/or interlobular septal thickening, and crazy paving appearance. In the routine of oncology, the differential diagnosis of adverse events from COVID-19 is also significant, including radiation pneumonitis, checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), neutropenic fever, and so on. During the epidemic, indications of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and CT-guided percutaneous thoracic biopsy are strictly controlled. For patients who are planning to undergo biopsy operation, screening to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 should be carried out. For confirmed or suspected patients, three-level protection should be performed during the operation. Disinfection and isolation measures should be strictly carried out during the operation.

As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, extrapulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 have emerged, especially in the digestive system. While the respiratory mode of transmission is well known and is probably the principal mode of transmission of this disease, a possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenarios. In this review article, we summarize four different aspects in published studies to date: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19; (b) microbiological and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the digestive endoscopy room.

It is believed that children are less likely than adults to be infected with COVID-19. In this review, we discuss different aspects of COVID-19 infection in pediatrics. COVID-19 in pediatrics occurs in the early stages of its outbreak at a high rate with a family cluster pattern mainly. Children infected with COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic carriers and the main potential causes of the spread and transmission of the disease in com-munities. Asymptomatic children with no underlying disease or red flags should follow home isolation protocols. Children with red flags, comorbidities and risk factors or those with severe pneumonia must be admitted to the hospitals. Children’s hospitals should be equipped with the acute respiratory diseases ward, quarantine rooms, and intensive care unit to protect other patients and health care staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2020, Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Neonates; Pediatrics","alanine aminotransferase; alpha2b interferon; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; corticosteroid; creatine kinase MB; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; lactate dehydrogenase; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nitric oxide; oseltamivir; paracetamol; procalcitonin; surfactant; artificial ventilation; asymptomatic infection; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; epidemic; extracorporeal oxygenation; fever; human; length of stay; leukocyte count; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; mortality rate; pediatrician; pediatrics; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; thorax radiography",,"Iran.

This rapid pandemic may overwhelm health care capacity and shortage of resources is a major concern. Literature provided guidelines on management of COVID-19 patients but healthcare service to the normal population should be continued meanwhile. Health system should act immediately and wisely to support essential surgical care while fighting against COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in the major data bases since 2020, using the combination of MeSH words of ""COVID-19 "" and ""surgery"" and finally 34 full texts entered to data extraction phase to define a plan for surgical practice during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early stage of outbreak when they were not aware of the different aspects of COVID-19 pandemic. All healthcare staff must be trained to properly use PPE. All patients have to be screened at the hospital triage. All elective surgical interventions must be postponed. Operation room is considered as a place with high risk of cross infection so the highest level of protection should be maintained. Anesthesia, endoscopy and oral surgery are considered as aerosol producing procedures with very high risk of contamination. There is not any evidence to support the risk of infection trough blood products. Postoperative respiratory problems are more common among COVID-19 patients that may increases the estimated risk of morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic challenge for health system to save the healthcare staff and equipment resources by timely decisions. Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early phase of epidemic when the protection is sub-optimal. © 2020 BY THE ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Outbreak; Pandemics; Surgery","aerosol; anesthesia; blood donor; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; cross infection; dentistry; emergency health service; endoscopy; general hospital; health care personnel; human; infection risk; medical staff; morbidity; mortality risk; nonhuman; oral surgery; orthopedics; otorhinolaryngology; pandemic; pediatric surgery; postoperative period; preoperative period; Review; surgery; surgical ward; systematic review; urology; viral contamination",,"Arch.

The whole-genome nucleotide identity of the pathogens causing the two diseases reached 79.5%. The mechanism and treatment of COVID-19 are still under investigation. Combining the experiences of SARS prevention and treatment in 2003, and the case data and literature of COVID-19, the similarities and differences between the two diseases in terms of causes, susceptible people, characteristics, dialectical mode, and treatment were analyzed. The two diseases are both plagues in terms of Chinese medicine. The cause of SARS was 'heat poison,' and its pathogenesis was 'heat poison, stasis, and qi and yin deficiency.' Therefore the treatment regimen was mainly to clear away heat, detoxicate, and expel evil. While the cause of COVID-19 was 'wet poison,' and its pathogenesis was 'wet, poison, heat, stasis, close, syncope, and yang collapse.' Hence the basic treatment strategy was to declare lung and remove dampness. Treatment of COVID-19 was clearing away evil qi as soon as possible, with the basic treatment regimen, which was declaring lung, removing dampness, and dispelling the evil. Combined with Traditional Chinese medicine's (TCM's) understanding and experience in SARS prevention and treatment, and Chinese clinical cured cases, we try to provide strategies for people all over the world to understand and respond to COVID-19, through the analysis and comparison. To improve COVID-19 prevention and treatment regimen and give full play to the advantages of TCM. © 2020 World Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine.","Coronavirus disease; differences; heat poison; severe acute respiratory syndrome; wet poison",,,"World J.

As of 31 March 2020, COVID-19 has spread in 200 countries, including Iran, and imposed serious health-related threats to the public worldwide. Fever, dry (non-productive) cough, myalgia, and pneumonia seem to be the symptoms of COVID-19 disease. To date, and despite various studies and investigations, except for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have recently been temporarily approved by FDA, no other vaccines and/or antiviral agents have been clinically endorsed for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, prevention of the disease and control of the infection is deemed a top priority for the general public. Owing to the characteristics of different dental treatments and settings, the risk of virus transmission can be considered high between patients and dental practitioners. Therefore, the need for strict and tough effective infection control protocols in dental practice is of great importance, namely for the dental centers in the potentially affected areas with COVID-19. This study, based on relevant evidence, aimed to review the basic knowledge of COVID-19 and address the recommended protocols of infection control for the dental practitioners and treatments in hypothetically stricken areas. © 2020, Kowsar Medical Publishing Company.

Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adenovirus; coronavirus; diagnostic methods; influenza virus; respiratory syncytial virus; respiratory viral infection; rhinovirus","DNA; quantum dot; Coronavirinae; diagnostic procedure; DNA microarray; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; high throughput sequencing; human; Human adenovirus C; Human respiratory syncytial virus; Human rhinovirus; immunoassay; immunofluorescence test; Influenza virus; intermethod comparison; lateral flow immunoassay; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; molecular diagnosis; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; Qiagen ResPlex II V2.0; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reproducibility; reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification; Review; semi-nested polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; viral respiratory tract infection; virus detection; virus isolation; Coronavirus infection; growth, development and aging; human adenovirus infection; immunological procedures; influenza; isolation and purification; nucleic acid amplification; picornavirus infection; respiratory syncytial virus infection; respiratory tract infection; Rhinovirus; virus; Adenovirus Infections, Human; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunologic Tests; Influenza, Human; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Picornaviridae Infections; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Tract Infections; Rhinovirus; Viruses","31944312","J.

This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. Methods: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: Cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. Results: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a proinflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications. © 2020 the authors.","Adverse events; Cancer; COVID-19; Immune modulation; Immune suppression","adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; baricitinib; certolizumab pegol; corticosteroid; cortisone derivative; etanercept; golimumab; ibuprofen; immunostimulating agent; immunosuppressive agent; infliximab; interleukin 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; Janus kinase inhibitor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mycophenolic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prednisolone; sarilumab; siltuximab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; tacrolimus; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; unindexed drug; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease marker; disease severity; down regulation; drug approval; enzyme inhibition; evidence based medicine; human; innate immunity; medical decision making; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein expression; protein targeting; Review; signal transduction; systematic review; treatment contraindication; upregulation; virus load",,"ecancermedicalscience",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083636640

Introduction of COVID-19 into a long-term residential care facility in Washington resulted in cases among 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died. Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. What are the implications for public health practice? Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members, restricting visitation except in compassionate care situations, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures. © 2020 Department of Health and Human Services.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020. Results All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign. Conclusions Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children. © 2020 Xiangya Hospital of CSU.

Clustered-Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), and CRISPR associated (Cas) protein (CRISPR/Cas) structures were first identified in E. coli in 1987 and guard prokaryotic cells from any invading pathogens, harmful events and plasmids by recognizing and cutting foreign nucleic acid sequences that contain short palindromic repeats spacer sequences. Several genome editing approaches have been developed based on these mechanisms; the most recent is known as CRISPR/Cas. Before the CRISPR technique was revealed in 2012, editing the genomes of plants and animals took many years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Thus, CRISPR/Cas has attracted significant interest in the scientific community, especially for disease diagnosis and treatment, as it is quicker, less expensive and more precise than other genome editing approaches. The evidence from gene mutations in specific patients generated using CRISPR/Cas can assist in the prediction of the optimal treatment schedule for individual patients and for innovation purposes in other researches like replication in cell culture of coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2 or COVID-19). However, in numerous situations, the effects of the furthermost significant driver mutations are not yet understood and interpretation of the optimal treatment is impossible. CRISPR/Cas classifications feature highly sensitive and selective tools for the detection of various target genes. When we see the next steps of genomic research, it is obvious that genome-wide association studies are relatively new way to identify the genes involved in human disease. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas provides a tool to manipulate non-coding regions and will thus accelerate examination of these poorly characterized regions of the genome and play a vital role in the progress of whole genome libraries. Aim. We aimed to review the history of CRISPR/Cas, the mechanisms of CRISPR techniques, its current status as a tool for studying both natural mutations and genomic manipulations, and explore how CRISPR/Cas may improve the treatment of diseases. © 2020 Scienceline Publication.","COVID-19; CRISPR/Cas9; DNA-targeting; Genome sequencing; Palindromic; Plasmids; SARS-CoV2",,,"J.

However, in the 21st century, 2 highly pathogenic HCoVs-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality. In December 2019, yet another pathogenic HCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was recognized in Wuhan, China, and has caused serious illness and death. The ultimate cope and effect of this outbreak is unclear at present as the situation is rapidly evolving. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is zoonotic diseases causing severe respiratory illness emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Phylogenetic studies and viral sequencing results strongly suggest that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors after evolutionary recombination process, primarily in dromedary camels in Africa. The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, the identification of MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus from dromedary camels of Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula are the suggestive evidence for inter-transmission of the virus, primarily from camels to humans and its public health risks. However, the infection in camel is mostly asymptomatic. In contrast to the camel case, the clinical signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure with an overall mortality rate of about 35%. Though inter-human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV human cases, the virus is currently incapable of causing sustained human-to-human transmission (pandemic occurrence). Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine available for treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV. The important measures to control MERS-CoV spread are strict regulation of camel movement, regular herd screening and isolation of infected camels, use of personal protective equipment by camel handlers and awareness creation on the public where consumption of unpasteurized camel milk is common. Therefore, urgent global epidemiological studies are required, to understand the transmission patterns and the human cases of MERS-CoV and also for the proper implementation of the above-mentioned control measures. © 2020 Scienceline Publication.","Bats; Dipeptidyl peptidase 4; Dromedary camels; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; Transmission",,,"J.

As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. Results: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Conclusions: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term. © 2020 The Author(s).","Causes; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Prevention and control; Review","2019 novel coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; disease severity; disease surveillance; disease transmission; dyspnea; fatigue; fever; headache; health care; hemoptysis; high throughput sequencing; human; incubation time; meta analysis; mortality rate; pathogenesis; pneumonia; prevention and control; priority journal; public health; public health service; quality control; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract infection; Review; rhinorrhea; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virology; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; coughing; dyspnea; epidemic; fatigue; fever; headache; infection control; virology; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Disease Outbreaks; Dyspnea; Fatigue; Fever; Headache; Humans; Infection Control; Pneumonia, Viral","32183901","Infect.

This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out? Endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to infect naïve, as well as individual with pre-existing immunity. Continuous monitoring is strongly advisable, not only to the newly infected individuals, but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as re-infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; pre existing immunity; SARS; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antibiotic agent; antiinflammatory agent; corticosteroid; methylprednisolone; asymptomatic infection; case fatality rate; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; critically ill patient; endemic disease; epidemic; health care personnel; human; humoral immunity; immunopathogenesis; inflammation; intermediate host; migrant bird; nonhuman; pandemic influenza; patient monitoring; phylogeny; pneumonia; priority journal; reinfection; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus entry; virus genome; virus immunity; virus mutant; virus mutation; virus replication; virus strain; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; immunology; mortality; mutation; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virulence; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Endemic Diseases; Humans; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virulence","32282268","Crit.

SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection. The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia. Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far. In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated. Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued. Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment. In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9–80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0–30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7–51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1–9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2–21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). Conclusion: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical features; Coronavirus disease 2019; Epidemic; Laboratory; Outcomes; SARS-CoV-2","adult respiratory distress syndrome; case fatality rate; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diagnostic imaging; dyspnea; fatality; fever; hospital patient; human; intensive care unit; laboratory test; meta analysis; prevalence; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; systematic review; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; hospitalization; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult","32179124","Travel Med.

With any or many reasons, this newly emerged novel-Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been recognized in more than 70 locations around the globe. The disease caused by 2019-nCoV has been named as “coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19”. Due to the rising number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infected cases and widespread detection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced 2019-nCoV as a threatening health concern, and urgent robust actions are of supreme interest to tackle this global health emergency. Owing to this new emergence, we know relatively little about 2019-nCoV, which is a highly pathogenic human pathogen. To completely overcome this life-threatening 2019-nCoV pathogen, further in-depth studies are needed to gain insight and complete understanding about its fast mode spread, replication, and pathogenesis. Since the first appearance and detection of 2019-nCoV and COVID-19, respectively, the current literature lacks the global perspective and replication cycle of 2019-nCoV. Thus, herein, an effort has been made to cover this literature gap. A proper understanding of the 2019-nCoV replication will further insight and strengthen the infection control measures, transmission prevention, and vaccine development, effectively. © The Author(s) 2020.

An advent of a mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in December 2019, traced from the seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China, spread the wings over the world in very short span. Like both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) and MERS-CoV infections, the risk of severe disease increases substantially with age and with the presence of underlying conditions. While cancer is a prevalent disease and a global health challenge, little information is available with regard to the implications of COVID-19 for cancer patients. So far, the data have been limited and fragmented. COVID-19 with different primary cancer types will have different biological behaviours with highly variable disease courses and diverse treatment strategies. Any generalized conclusions for all cancer patients with respect to COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution until we have sufficient prospective data. Enormous work needs to be done to study the specific unmet needs of cancer patients with the challenge of the COVID-19; the prevention still is the best remedy. Infection control measures should be enforced continuously, and public health education and engagement should be highly recommended. We propose to join hands together to combat against COVID-19 with some simple tips for our cancer patients to raise their awareness of this public health challenge-combating against COVID-19 with 'COVID:' Continue 'social distancing;' Omit unnecessary face-to-face meting or meal gathering or mass event, make use of cyber meeting, and bring one's own lunch box to work; Visage protection, i.e. universal precaution with surgical masks when going out in a large crowd such as public transport or any close contact in high-risk area; Infection control of the hands with hand hygiene at all times and; Diet, lifestyle, and exercise continue to be balanced and healthy. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The virus is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through droplets and contacts, and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia. A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death. The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak. In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system. These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.","COVID-19; gene editing; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","virus antibody; Betacoronavirus; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; pandemic; real time polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; serology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis; Serologic Tests","32376546","Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084327447

Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus of approximately 160-80 nm in size and genomic size of approximately 27-35 kb which causes COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue and muscle weakness, shortness of breath, sputum, headache, diarrhea and muscle inflammation. It causes death in the elderly, people with hypertension, a history of cardiovascular diseases, people with diabetes, cancer, impaired immune system, transplanted, and all people with immunocompromised weakness. Various studies have shown that three major events are respiratory disorders, lymphocytopenia, and cytokine storm as SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the ACE-2 receptor on the surface of alveolar type 2 lung cells; in which case, pneumonia, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and even death occur because of the failure in the adjustment of inflammatory responses from immune system and proliferation of cytokines. As the virus enters the cells, receptors of intrinsic immune system-TLR3, TLR7 (endosomal receptors) and RIG-I and MDA-5 (cytosolic receptors) detects the RNA of the virus. Involvement of the receptors ends up with the production of different types of cytokines such as type I interferons and inflammation. In respect of acquired cellular immune system of Th1, Th2, and Th17 lymphocytes with cytokine production, the lymphocytes T CD8+ (CTL) play their part by producing perforin, granzyme and cytokine. Humoral-acquired immune activity can be determined in most patients by producing IgM (9 days after disease onset) and IgG (two weeks after disease onset). SARS-CoV-2 makes use of mechanisms such as disruption in the production of type I interferons, reduction of MHC-I, MHC-II expression, and increase of Tim-3 and PD-1 expression on the surface of CTL cells (T cell exhaustion) in order to evade the immune system. In this paper, we present a review of the most recent data on the immunopathogenic mechanisms of the infection with respiratory viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

There are currently no drug or vaccine for this disease. In the absence of treatment for this new virus, finding alternative methods to prevent and control of the disease is important. Having a well-functioning immune system is essential for the host's defense against pathogenic organisms. Malnutrition can lead to an impaired immune system during life. Even though the immune system response to infection, is itself a factor that could lead to nutritional status impairment. Deficiency of some nutrients can lead to disorders of immune system. Adequate intake of vitamins (A, D, Bs, C and E), minerals (selenium, zinc and iron) and omega-3 fatty acids are among the essential factors in proper immune system function. Therefore, it is recommended to follow a healthy diet to prevent the Covid-19. It is also suggested to assess the nutritional status of patients before prescribing treatments. © 2020 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dogs might be secondary hosts during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne routes. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for the COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic. In this review, we summarize the natural cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with the latest researches conducted in this field. This review will be helpful to think insights of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, spread, and demand for seroprevalence studies, especially in companion animals. © 2020","Animals; COVID-19; Pets; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission",,,"J.

It is recommended to use real-time RT-PCR for RNA viruses in order (a) to perform a rapid and accurate diagnostic, (b) to guide patient care and management and (c) to guide epidemiological strategies. Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis. Objectives: The aim was to guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results. Sources: A search of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis. Content: The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Implications: Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (a) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (b) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays and (c) for epidemiological purposes. © 2020 The Authors","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Molecular diagnostic testing; Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; SARS-COV-2; Serology",,"32593741","Clin.

Recently, concern arose on unrecognized infections before this date. For a better understanding of the pandemic, we retrospectively analyzed patient samples for SARS-CoV-2 from the prospective CAPNETZ study cohort. Methods: We used nasopharyngeal swab samples from a cohort of well characterized patients with community acquired pneumonia of the CAPNETZ study group, recruited from different geographic regions across Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland between 02nd December 2019 and 28th April 2020. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR for a broad range of respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR were performed on all samples. Results: In our cohort, respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 21.5% (42/195) of patients with rhinovirus as the most frequently detected pathogen. The detection rate increased to 29.7% (58/195) when SARS-CoV-2 was included. No SARS-CoV-2 positive sample was detected before end of March 2020. Conclusions: Respiratory viral pathogens accounted for a considerable number of positive results but no SARS-CoV-2 case was identified before the end of March 2020. © 2020, The Author(s).","Community acquired pneumonia; Epidemiology; Multiplex RT-PCR; Respiratory pathogens; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Infection",Letter,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087463560

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Influenza A was one of the most common co-infective viruses, which may have caused initial false-negative results of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens.

Based on previous studies of neuroinvasive human respiratory coronaviruses, it is proposed that after physical contact with the nasal mucosa, laryngopharynx, trachea, lower respiratory tract, alveoli epithelium, or gastrointestinal mucosa, SARS-CoV-2 can induce intrinsic and innate immune responses in the host involving increased cytokine release, tissue damage, and high neurosusceptibility to COVID-19, especially in the hypoxic conditions caused by lung injury.

The virus spread triggered a health crisis (the COVID-19 disease) within three months, with socioeconomic implications. No approved targeted-therapies are available for COVID-19, yet. However, it is foreseen that antibody-based treatments may provide an immediate cure for patients. Current neutralizing antibody development studies primarily target the S protein among the structural elements of SARS-CoV-2, which mediates the cell entry of the virus through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of host cells.

Such emerging pathogens should be considered as a high threat to humans, animals, and environmental health. The year 2020 was welcomed by another significant virus from family Coronaviridae called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Within a short time, this disease attained the status of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Presently, COVID-19 has spread to more than 150 countries, therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic. The Chinese government, along with WHO, other health agencies, and many nations, are monitoring the current situation closely to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on humans, animals, and environmental health. In the context of the current situation, biosafety and biosecurity measure that focus on One Health aspects of the disease outbreaks and the SARS-CoV-2 spread are of great importance to restrain this pathogen. Along with these efforts, standard precaution and control measures should also be taken at personal and community level to prevent the spreading of any contagion diseases, including COVID-19. Researchers are putting their very high efforts to develop suitable vaccines and therapeutics/drugs to combat COVID-19. This review aims to highlight the importance of biosafety, biosecurity, One Health approach, and focusing on recent developments and the ways forward to prevent and control COVID-19 in a useful way. © TÜBİTAK.","2019-nCoV; Biosafety & biosecurity; COVID-19; Current scenario; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Turk.

The rapid spread of the virus and the precipitously increasing numbers of cases necessitate the urgent development of accurate diagnostic methods, effective treatments, and vaccines. Here, we review the progress of developing diagnostic methods, therapies, and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on current clinical trials and their challenges. For diagnosis, nucleic acid amplification tests remain the mainstay diagnostics for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while serological antibody tests are used to aid contact tracing, epidemiological, and vaccine evaluation studies. Viral isolation is not recommended for routine diagnostic procedures due to safety concerns. Currently, no single effective drug or specific vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Some candidate drugs targeting different levels and stages of human responses against COVID-19 such as cell membrane fusion, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, viral protease inhibitor, interleukin 6 blocker, and convalescent plasma may improve the clinical outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients. Other supportive care measures for critical patients are still necessary. Advances in genetic sequencing and other technological developments have sped up the establishment of a variety of vaccine platforms. Accordingly, numerous vaccines are under development. Vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are mainly based upon the viral spike protein due to its vital role in viral infectivity, and most of these candidates have recently moved into clinical trials. Before the efficacy of such vaccines in humans is demonstrated, strong international coordination and collaboration among studies, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and governments are needed to limit further damage due the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus. © 2020 Chang Gung University","Clinical trials; COVID-19; NAATs; SARS-CoV-2; Spike protein; Vaccine",,,"Biomed.

In this review, we situate COVID-19 in its context as a transboundary viral disease, and provide a comprehensive discussion focused on the discovery, spread, virology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of this disease, its causative coronaviral pathogen, and approaches to combating the disease through immunotherapies and other treatments and vaccine development. An epidemiological survey revealed a potentially large number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within the population, which may hamper efforts against COVID-19.

The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in frontal lobe sections from postmortem examination has confirmed the presence of the virus in neural tissue. This finding reveals a new direction in the search for a neurotherapeutic strategy in the COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases.

Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the ""gold standard"" for the detection of SARS-COV-2. There are several challenges associated with this test from sample collection to processing and the longer turnaround time for the results to be available. More rapid and faster diagnostic tests that may produce results within minutes to a few hours will be instrumental in controlling the disease. Serological tests that detect specific antibodies to the virus may be such options. In this review, we extensively searched for studies that compared RT-PCR with serological tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We extracted the data from the various selected studies that compared the different tests and summarised the available evidence to determine which test is more appropriate especially in Africa.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR) can detect SARS-COV-2 by targeting open reading frame-1 antibodies (ORF1ab), envelope protein, nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes, and the N1, N2, and N3 (3N) target genes. Therefore, rRT-PCR remains the primary method of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 despite being limited by false-negative results, long turnaround, complex protocols, and a need for skilled personnel. Serological diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is simple and does not require complex techniques and equipment, rendering it suitable for rapid detection and massive screening. However, serological tests cannot confirm SARS-CoV-2, and results will be false-negative when antibody concentrations fall below detection limits. Balancing the increased use of laboratory tests, risk of testing errors, need for tests, burden on healthcare systems, benefits of early diagnosis, and risk of unnecessary exposure is a significant and persistent challenge in diagnosing COVID-19. © 2020","Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody; Coronavirus disease-2019; Lateral flow immunoassay; Point-of-care; Real-time reverse transcription PCR",,,"J.

However, there are reports of neurological findings in HCoV infections, particularly in patients infected with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) amid Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to interpret the interaction of HCoVs and the nervous system and apply this understanding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This review of the literature analyses how HCoVs, in general, and SARS-CoV-2, in particular, affect the nervous system, highlights the various underlying mechanisms, addresses the associated neurological and psychiatric manifestations, and identifies the neurological risk factors involved. This review of literature shows the magnitude of neurological conditions associated with HCoV infections, including SARS-CoV-2. This review emphasises, that, during HCoV outbreaks, such as COVID-19, a focus on early detection of neurotropism, alertness for the resulting neurological complications, and the recognition of neurological risk factors are crucial to reduce the workload on hospitals, particularly intensive-care units and neurological departments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","autopsy; brain; COVID-19; human coronavirus; nervous system; neuroinvasion; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Rev.

To meet the exponential demand in testing, there has been an accelerated development of both molecular and serological assays across a plethora of platforms. The present review discusses the current literature on these modalities, including nucleic acid amplification tests, direct viral antigen tests and the rapidly expanding laboratory-based and point of care serological tests.

From the epidemiological data, the picture emerges that the more severe etiopathologies among COVID-19 patients are found in elderly people. The risk of death due to COVID-19 increases exponentially with age. Eight out of 10 COVID-19 related deaths occur in people older than 65 years of age. Older patients with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer have a much higher case fatality rate. Governments and public health authorities all over the world have realized that protections of vulnerable older adults should be a priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally transmitted likely from a bat or a pangolin to humans. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, similar to other coronaviruses, can infect several species of animals, including companion animals such as dogs, cats, and ferrets although their viral loads remain low. While the main source of infection transmission therefore is human to human, there are a few rare cases of pets contracting the infection from a SARS-CoV-2-infected human. Although there is no evidence that pets actively transmit SARS-CoV-2 via animal-to-human transmission, senior pet ownership potentially may pose a small risk to older adults by (1) potentially enabling animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the most vulnerable population and (2) by increasing the exposition risk for the elderly due to the necessity to care for the pet and, in the case of dogs, to take them outside the house several times per day. In this overview, the available evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets is considered and the potential for spread of COVID-19 from companion animals to older individuals and the importance of prevention are discussed. © 2020, American Aging Association.","Aging; SARS-CoV-2; Senescence",,,"GeroScience",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089064552

Therefore, there is an urgent need for devising more efficient preventive measures, to limit the spread of the infection until an effective treatment or vaccine is available. The preventive measures depend mainly on the understanding of the transmission routes of this virus, its environmental stability, and its persistence on common touch surfaces. Due to the very limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, we can speculate its stability in the light of previous studies conducted on other human and animal coronaviruses. In this review, we present the available data on the stability of coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, from previous reports to help understand its environmental survival. According to available data, possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested. SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal CoVs have remarkably short persistence on copper, latex and surfaces with low porosity as compared to other surfaces like stainless steel, plastics, glass and highly porous fabrics. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with diarrhoea and that it is shed in the faeces of COVID-19 patients. Some CoVs show persistence in human excrement, sewage and waters for a few days. These findings suggest a possible risk of faecal–oral, foodborne and waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries that often use sewage-polluted waters in irrigation and have poor water treatment systems. CoVs survive longer in the environment at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity. It has been suggested that large numbers of COVID-19 cases are associated with cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and that seasonality of the virus spread is suspected. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","animal coronaviruses; common touch surfaces; COVID-19; environmental conditions; fomites; human coronaviruses; inanimate surfaces; persistence; SARS-CoV-2; stability; survivability; virus survival",,"32603505","Transboundary Emer.

Scientists and clinicians must acknowledge that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to attack the human body in multiple ways simultaneously and exploit any weaknesses of its host. A multipronged attack could potentially explain the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the diverse tactics of this virus to infect the human body is both critical and incredibly complex. Although patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have primarily presented with pulmonary involvement, viral invasion, and injury to diverse end organs is also prevalent and well documented in these patients, but has been largely unheeded. Human organs known for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, adrenals, brain, and testicles are examples of extra pulmonary tissues with confirmed invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Initial multiple organ involvement may present with vague signs and symptoms to alert health care professionals early in the course of COVID-19. Another example of an ongoing, yet neglected element of the syndromic features of COVID-19, are the reported findings of loss of smell, altered taste, ataxia, headache, dizziness, and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential for neural involvement. In this review, we further deliberate on the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the neurologic symptomology observed in COVID-19, the host-virus interaction, possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system, other neurologic considerations for patients with COVID-19, and a collective call to action. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","brain; central nervous system; cerebrospinal fluid; coronavirus; COVID-19; neuroinvasive; neuron; neurotropic; olfactory; SARS-CoV-2; transcribrial",,"32492193","J.

Bats are considered as the reservoir host, and the search of a probable intermediate host is still going on. The severe form of the infection is associated with death is mainly reported in older and immune-compromised patients with pre-existing disease history. Death in severe cases is attributed to respiratory failure associated with hyperinflammation. Cytokine storm syndrome associated with inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered as the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients have thus higher levels of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The blood laboratory profile of the COVID-19 patients exhibits lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and RNAaemia, along with increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women does not lead to fetus mortality, unlike other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and there is, to date, no evidence of intrauterine transmission to neonates.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is characterized by symptoms such as fever and dyspnea accompanied by infrequent incidence of lymphopenia, gastrointestinal complications such as elevated hepatic aminotransferases, and diarrhea. Originating in bats, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been transmitted to humans likely via an intermediate host that is yet to be discovered. Owing to the absence of any vaccines or definite anti-viral drugs alongside the greater mobility of people across the globe, international and national efforts in containing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection are experiencing severe difficulties.

The olfactory dysfunction often occurs early in the course of the disease, and sometimes it is the only symptom in otherwise asymptomatic carriers. The cellular mechanisms for these specific olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 are now beginning to be elucidated. Several very recent papers contributed to explaining the key cellular steps occurring in the olfactory epithelium leading to anosmia/hyposmia (collectively known as dysosmia) initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this Viewpoint, we discuss current progress in research on olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and we also propose an updated model of the SARS-CoV-2-induced dysosmia. The emerging central role of sustentacular cells and inflammatory processes in the olfactory epithelium are particularly considered. The proposed model of anosmia in COVID-19 does not answer unequivocally whether the new coronavirus exploits the olfactory route to rapidly or slowly reach the brain in COVID-19 patients.

The need for additional research in viral pathogenesis is essential as the number of cases and deaths rise. Understanding the virus and its ability to cause disease has been the main focus of current literature; however, there is much unknown. Studies have revealed new findings related to the full transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its subsequent ability to cause infection by different means. The virus is hypothesized to be of increased virulence compared with previous coronavirus that caused epidemics, in part due to its overall structural integrity and resilience to inactivation. To date, many studies have discussed that the rationale behind its transmission potential is that viral RNA has unexpectedly been detected in multiple bodily fluids, with some samples having remained positive for extended periods of time. Additionally, the receptor by which the virus gains cellular entry, ACE2, has been found to be expressed in different human body systems, thereby potentiating its infection in those locations. In this evidence-based comprehensive review, we discuss various potential routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2—respiratory/droplet, indirect, fecal-oral, vertical, sexual, and ocular. Understanding these different routes is important as they pertain to clinical practice, especially in taking preventative measures to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Modes; RNA; Routes; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission",,,"Eur.

Most human CoVs have recently attracted global attention to their lethal potential and great infectious capacity. A highly pathogenic CoV, called COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, dramatically emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This new CoV has caused severe pneumonia in China and rapidly spreads around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing evidence pieces show that viruses, such as CoVs, can enter the central nervous system from different pathways and inducing neurotoxicity. Therefore, it is urgent to make clear whether SARS-CoV-2 has access to the central nervous system and can cause direct neuronal effects. Moreover, a brain–lung–brain axis is been proposed from the scientific community where severe neurological dysfunction and injury are associated with lung injury, and vice versa. In this axis, virus-induced inflammation and oxidative stress could be the common mechanisms responsible for CoV neurological symptoms.

Coronaviruses belong to the order of Nidovirales, family of Coronavirinae and are divided into four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus. CoVs cause diseases in a wide variety of birds and mammals and have been found in humans since 1960. To date, seven human CoVs were identified including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and the novel virus that first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to 213 countries as of the writing this paper. It was ofﬁcially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) and the disease's name is COVID-19 for coronavirus disease 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious and is capable of spreading from human to human. Infection routes include droplet and contact, and aerosol transmission is currently under investigation. It is associated with a respiratory illness that may cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 became an emergency of international concern. As of July 12, 2020, the virus has been responsible for 12,698,995 confirmed cases and 564,924 deaths worldwide and the number is still increasing. Up until now, no specific treatment has yet been proven effective against SARS-CoV-2. Since the beginning of this outbreak, several interesting papers on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 have been published to report on the phylogenetic evolution, epidemiology, pathogenesis, transmission as well as clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and possible treatments agents. This paper is a systematic review of the available literature on SARS-CoV-2. It was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and aims to help readers access the latest knowledge surrounding this new infectious disease and to provide a reference for future studies. © 2020 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Emergence; Prevention; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission; Treatment",,,"J.

However, the two main professional societies for human reproduction (ESHRE and ASRM) appear divergent on their clinical utility and whether they should be adopted. In this opinion paper, we review the currently available tests and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed clinical care pathways. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 testing but test results are largely influenced by viral load, sample site, specimen collection method, and specimen shipment technique, such that a negative result in a symptomatic patient cannot be relied upon. Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies exhibit a temporal increase in sensitivity and specificity after symptom onset irrespective of the assay used, with sensitivity estimates ranging from 0 to 50% with the first 3 days of symptoms, to 83 to 88% at 10 days, increasing to almost 100% at ≥ 14 days. These inherent constraints in diagnostics would suggest that at present there is inadequate evidence to utilize SARS-CoV-2 testing to stratify fertility patients and reliably inform clinical decision-making. The failure to appreciate the characteristics and limitations of the diagnostic tests may lead to disastrous consequences for the patient and the multidisciplinary team looking after them. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ASRM; COVID-19; ESHRE; IVF; SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak, a pandemic. Objective: To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. Results: We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy. Conclusions: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially large vessel stroke, Guillain–Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. Moving forward, further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence of the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigate their biological backgrounds, and test treatment options. Physicians should be cautious not to overlook other neurological diagnoses that can mimic COVID-19 during the pandemic. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Neurological complications; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2",,,"J.

In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Wuhan City, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are found in the vast majority of all COVID-19 cases. Early diagnosis, treatment and future prevention are keys to COVID-19 management. Currently, the unmet need to develop cost-effective point-of-contact test kits and efficient laboratory techniques for confirmation of COVID-19 infection has powered a new frontier of diagnostic innovation. No proven effective therapies or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. The rapidly increasing research regarding COVID-19 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Remdesivir may be the most promising therapy up till now. On May 1, 2020, Gilead Sciences, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational Remdesivir as a potential antiviral for COVID-19 treatment. On May 7, 2020, Gilead Sciences, announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) has granted regulatory approval of Veklury® (Remdesivir) as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19 acute respiratory syndrome, under an exceptional approval pathway. Also, Corticosteroids are recommended for severe cases only to suppress the immune response and reduce symptoms, but not for mild and moderate patients where they are associated with a high-risk side effect. Based on the currently published evidence, we tried to highlight different diagnostic approaches, side effects and therapeutic agents that could help physicians in the frontlines. © 2020, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors.

To date, there are no proven effective therapies for this virus. Efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 are underway. Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, predispose patients to co-infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality. Numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). Although antibiotics do not directly affect SARS-CoV-2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that some patients die from bacterial co-infection rather than virus itself. To date, a considerable number of bacterial strains have been resistant to various antibiotics such as azithromycin, and the overuse could render those or other antibiotics even less effective. Therefore, bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection are considered critical risk factors for the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19. Also, the antibiotic-resistant as a result of overusing must be considered.

The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective.

As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including delirium occurring in critically ill patients (ICU delirium). Due attention must be paid to this subject in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delirium, the detection of which takes less than two minutes, is frequently underestimated during daily routine ICU care, but it may be a prodromal symptom of infection or hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic delirium monitoring using validated tests (CAM-ICU or ICDSC) may be sacrificed. This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment. Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus. The purpose of this review is to identify problems related to the development of delirium during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are presented in three areas: i) factors contributing to delirium in COVID-19, ii) potential pathophysiological factors of delirium in COVID-19, and iii) long-term consequences of delirium in COVID-19. This article discusses how healthcare workers can reduce the burden of delirium by identifying potential risk factors and difficulties during challenges associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","coronavirus; delirium; pain; pandemic; PICS; PTSD; SARS-CoV-2; sedation; COVID-19","Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; delirium; human; intensive care unit; pandemic; psychology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delirium; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32419438","Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088364607

With the expanding domain of presentations in COVID-19 patients, the full range of manifestations is yet to unfold. The classical clinical symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 affected patients are dry cough, high fever, dyspnoea, lethal pneumonia whereas many patients have also been found to be associated with a few additional signs and clinical manifestations of isolated vasculopathy. Albeit a deep and profound knowledge has been gained on the clinical features and management of COVID-19, less clear association has been provided on SARS-CoV-2 mediated direct or indirect vasculopathy and its possible correlation with disease prognosis. The accumulative evidences suggest that novel coronavirus, apart from its primary respiratory confinement, may also invade vascular endothelial cells of several systems including cerebral, cardio-pulmonary as well as renal microvasculature, modulating multiple visceral perfusion indices. Here we analyse the phylogenetic perspective of SARS-CoV-2 along with other strains of β-coronaviridae from a standpoint of vasculopathic derangements. Based on the existing case reports, literature and open data bases, we also analyse the differential pattern of vasculopathy related changes in COVID-19 positive patients. Besides, we debate the need of modulation in clinical approach from a hemodynamical point of view, as a measure towards reducing disease transmission, morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 affected patients. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ACE2; Endothelium; Hemodynamics; Hypercytokinemia; SARS-CoV-2; Thrombosis; Vasculopathy",,"32627126","J.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a steep decrease in elective surgery scheduling, to the extent of complete cancellation without future planning of safe development. Purpose: We performed a review of the literature and diagnosis data analysis with the aim to reduce the risk of operating a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 during the incubation period. Methods: We searched for specific words and phrases about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in the PubMed database (US National Library of Medicine) from December 2019 to April 2020. A detailed analysis of the clinical picture and existing diagnostic tests for COVID-19 was performed to achieve the desired objectives. Results: A total of 1273 out of 5930 articles about COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 did meet the criteria for the searched terms. We reviewed 105 articles, and 60 were selected for analysis. Specific recommendations were described based on our revision. Conclusions: With the combination of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody tests + real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 implemented in different time periods by taking into account the natural history of the disease, it is possible to decrease the risk of operating a patient during the incubation period higher than 93%. Adding other security measures can further increase this percentage. As long as there is no immunity to COVID-19, these measures will help us to perform safer elective surgeries. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",,,,"Plast. Reconstr.

This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a pandemic. To date, it has resulted in ~9 million confirmed cases and caused almost 500 000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID-19 pandemic is the gravest health and socioeconomic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence-based medical advice on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self-limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID-19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a “cytokine storm” leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thromboembolic complications, and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID-19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID-19–related topics should be based on more coordinated high-quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development, and epidemiology.

Little is understood about its effects during pregnancy. Aims: To describe the current understanding of COVID-19 illness in pregnant women, to describe obstetric outcomes and to identify gaps in the existing knowledge. Methods: Medline Ovid, EMBASE, World Health Organization COVID-19 research database and Cochrane COVID-19 in pregnancy spreadsheet were accessed on 18/4, 18/5 and 23/5 2020. Articles were screened via Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following were excluded: reviews, opinion pieces, guidelines, articles pertaining solely to other viruses, single case reports. Results: Sixty articles were included in this review. Some pregnant participants may have been included in multiple publications, as admission dates overlap for reports from the same hospital. However, a total of 1287 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant cases are reported. Where universal testing was undertaken, asymptomatic infection occurred in 43.5–92% of cases. In the cohort studies, severe and critical COVID-19 illness rates approximated those of the non-pregnant population. Eight maternal deaths, six neonatal deaths, seven stillbirths and five miscarriages were reported. Thirteen neonates were SARS-CoV-2 positive, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions: Where universal screening was conducted, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was often asymptomatic. Severe and critical disease rates approximate those in the general population. Vertical transmission is possible; however, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were infected in utero, intrapartum or postpartum.

These studies should have been published after the guide for the management of patients with COVID-19 from World Health Organization guide (available in March 13, 2020). Results: Seventeen studies were included, in which 143 clinical samples were identified (38 of amniotic fluid; 34 of placentas or membranes; 39 from umbilical cord blood and 32 from human milk). Among the 143 samples, nine were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (one amniotic fluid sample obtained before rupturing the membranes; six samples of placenta or membranes, although authors indicate the possibility of contamination by maternal blood in three of these, and two samples of human milk). Conclusions: Following our search criteria, we found no studies that demonstrate the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with viral isolation and the evaluation of the infective capacity of viral particles, in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood and human milk, from women with a confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

Within a short span, COVID-19 was declared a global public health emergency affecting 214 countries with 5,939,234 confirmed cases and 3,67,255 deaths as of 30 May 2020. With limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment or vaccine is available till date. Areas covered: We performed a review of literature on PubMed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness including trials of preventive and therapeutic measures. This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present pandemic. Expert opinion: The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, health-care professionals, and scientists around the world under tremendous pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction, and aggressive steps such as ‘lockdown.’ Clinical trials at different phases are ongoing across different countries to expedite the development of effective drugs and vaccine to overcome the pandemic. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2",,"32529866","Expert Rev.

Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues. In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed. It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19. In conclusion, this review may provide useful information in developing some promising strategies to end up with a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Since the initial outbreak in China on December 2019, the international scientific community joined efforts in an unprecedent public health battle. In late May 2020, 5 204 508 cases and 337 687 deaths have been reported by World Health Organization, with higher number of cases in Europe and Americas. SARS-CoV-2 was described as a novel variant from the coronavirus family and its genome was sequenced within a few months while COVID 19 quickly spread worldwide. The main cell receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) was identified as involved in the invasion of host cells. As a result of the findings from cell biology, immunology and clinical studies, the pathogenesis of the virus started to be understood but it has been not fully elucidated so far. While a massive effort for the development of a vaccine is on course, preventive protocols for infection control have been proposed. Many studies on the discovering of effective therapeutic protocols have been developed, particularly on the redirection of already approved substances, but no gold standard treatment was established until now.

However, emerging evidence indicates that a small but growing number of COVID-19 patients also manifest neurological symptoms, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the nervous system under some circumstances. SARS-CoV-2 primarily enters the body through the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but under certain conditions this pleiotropic virus may also infect peripheral nerves and gain entry into the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is shielded by various anatomical and physiological barriers, most notably the blood–brain barrier (BBB) which functions to prevent harmful substances, including pathogens and pro-inflammatory mediators, from entering the brain. The BBB is composed of highly specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, mast cells and astrocytes that form the neurovascular unit, which regulates BBB permeability and maintains the integrity of the CNS. In this review, potential routes of viral entry and the possible mechanisms utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate the CNS, either by disrupting the BBB or infecting the peripheral nerves and using the neuronal network to initiate neuroinflammation, are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with other human coronaviruses are considered. Although the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS and neurovirulence are currently unknown, the potential pathways described here might pave the way for future research in this area and enable the development of better therapeutic strategies. © 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of viral shedding from different sites and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response during the acute and convalescent phases of nine children with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in their nasopharyngeal swabs (9/9, 100%), stool samples (8/9, 89%), and oropharyngeal swabs (3/9, 33%) but was not detected in their serum and urine samples. The median duration of viral shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and stools was 13, 4, and 43 days respectively, and the maximum duration of viral shedding detected from stools was 46 days after discharge. In children, nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be a more sensitive specimen type for the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with oropharyngeal swabs.

SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with epithelial cell and respiratory system proclivity. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening disease. Due to wide geographic impact affecting an extremely high proportion of the world population it was defined by the World Health Organization as a global public health pandemic. The infection is known to readily spread from person-to-person. This occurs through liquid droplets by cough, sneeze, hand-to-mouth-to-eye contact and through contaminated hard surfaces. Close human proximity accelerates SARS-CoV-2 spread. COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can move beyond the lungs by blood-based dissemination to affect multiple organs. These organs include the kidney, liver, muscles, nervous system, and spleen. The primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 mortality is acute respiratory distress syndrome initiated by epithelial infection and alveolar macrophage activation in the lungs. The early cell-based portal for viral entry is through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Viral origins are zoonotic with genomic linkages to the bat coronaviruses but without an identifiable intermediate animal reservoir. There are currently few therapeutic options, and while many are being tested, although none are effective in curtailing the death rates. There is no available vaccine yet. Intense global efforts have targeted research into a better understanding of the epidemiology, molecular biology, pharmacology, and pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2. These fields of study will provide the insights directed to curtailing this disease outbreak with intense international impact.

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. Results: From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. Conclusions: There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway. The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for newborns diagnosed with COVID-19 using PubMed, LILACS and Google scholar until May 15, 2020, looking for published articles with pregnancy, vertical transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, delivery. Results: There were found 10 articles with a total of 15 newborn infected with SARS-CoV-2 according to positive PCR at birth or in the first days of birth. Eleven newborn birth by cesarean section and 4 vaginally. Of the 11 cases with cesarean section, two presented premature rupture of the membranes. Seven newborns developed pneumonia, of which two had ruptured membranes and one was born by vaginal delivery. Conclusion: This review shows that there is perinatal or neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2 by finding a positive PCR in the first days of birth. In addition, that there is more possibility of neonatal infection if the birth is vaginal or if there is premature rupture of the membranes before cesarean section.

The first laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 in India was reported from Kerala on 30th January 2020. Since then the novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) cases have been presenting to the hospital emergencies as severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or influenza like illness (ILI). As on 4th June, 2020, about 2,10,000 confirmed cases have been detected in India with around 6,100 reported deaths. The major mode of transmission has been via close contact with infected individuals through respiratory droplets and fomites. The clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic (fever, myalgia, and sore throat) to acute respiratory distress syndrome as a part of cytokine release syndrome. The diagnosis depends on nucleic acid detection by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, IgM/IgG antibodies detection and typical radiological appearance in high suspects. Social distancing, isolation precautions, and proper hand hygiene with good cough etiquettes are all very important infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in mitigating the spread of the contagion. Repurposing of old and existing drugs like hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, interferons have been found to be useful in various trials. Role of convalescent plasma and anti-inflammatory/immune-suppressive therapy is also being tried to some effect in cases with cytokine release syndrome.

A novel coronavirus, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome, also called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), seems to be a new member of neuroinvasive viruses. While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps on spreading around the world rapidly, reports about the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2, increases day by day. It is reported that a variety of symptoms and syndromes such as headache, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain and myopathy are common especially in more severe COVID-19 patients. It is also suggested that the development of neurological complications is strongly associated with a poor outcome. On the other hand, hyposmia can be the unique symptom in COVID-19 carriers and this can serve as a marker for identifying the otherwise asymptomatically infected patients. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2 may cause neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms. Nevertheless, neuroinvasion capability of SARS-CoV2 is confirmed by the presence of the virus, in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient with encephalitis, and this is proven by gene sequencing. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to be aware of the possible neurological complications of the disease. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Due to the high homology of SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, reviewing the neurological involvement also associated with these coronaviruses will provide an idea about the long-term complications of COVID-19. © 2020 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Coronavirus disease 19; COVID-19; Neurological symptom; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; ataxia; blood brain barrier; brain ischemia; cerebrospinal fluid; computer assisted tomography; confusion; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; disseminated intravascular clotting; dizziness; epilepsy; gene sequence; Guillain Barre syndrome; headache; hospitalization; human; hypertension; hypogeusia; hyposmia; Middle East respiratory syndrome; multiple sclerosis; myopathy; neurologist; neuropathic pain; pandemic; Review; rhabdomyolysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Zika fever",,"Noropsikiyatr.

COVID-19 is not only a critical threat for the population with risk factors, but also generates a dramatic economic impact in terms of morbidity and the overall interruption of economic activities. Areas covered: Advanced materials are the basis of several technologies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19: biosensors might allow early virus detection, nanosized vaccines are powerful agents that could prevent viral infections, and nanosystems with antiviral activity could bind the virus for inactivation or destruction upon application of an external stimulus. Herein all these methods are discussed under the light of cutting-edge technologies and the previously reported prototypes targeting enveloped viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search (including pubmed) performed on April 2020.

However, little is currently known about the biology of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes polyproteins, four structural proteins and six accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of various mammals. The imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor pathway in the renin-angiotensin system leads to multi-system inflammation. The early symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are low to midgrade fever, dry cough and fatigue. Vigilant screening is important. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Isolation and quarantine of suspected cases is recommended.

As soon as the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified and its genome sequence determined, a laboratory diagnosis based on nucleic acid amplification technologies was quickly established and has played essential roles in the confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Serological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is becoming available for complementary diagnosis, identification of convalescent plasma, and epidemiologic studies. Additional laboratory biochemical tests, including monitoring the change in blood cells, blood gas, coagulation, liver function, cardiac markers, and inflammatory responses such as cytokine levels in plasma, are also critical in combating COVID-19. Nevertheless, with overwhelming numbers of patients and potentially large numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical laboratories encounter enormous challenges in diagnostic approaches that can rapidly and accurately identify infected persons. Strategies that can effectively detect disease progression in order to stratify patients for appropriate care, and that can thereby prevent exacerbation of the disease, are urgently needed.

In our country, we started to observe the first cases by March 2020. SARS-CoV-2, which is transmitted by droplets and by way of contact with surfaces contaminated by these droplets, is generally transmitted to children from adults through close contact. There is no proven information about other transmission routes such as fecal-oral transmission. Similar to adults, the primary symptoms at presentation include fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, nasal dis-charge, and rarely, vomiting and diarrhea in children. Although the majority of pediatric patients are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical course, severe cases have been reported in children with underlying chronic diseases. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Supportive treatment is recommended in children with a mild course, and some treatments are recommended in children with comorbidities or in children who are observed to have a more severe course. Asymptomatic pediatric patients or pediatric patients who have a mild course constitute an important group in terms of transmission of the infection to the advanced age group who carry high risk. Prevention of infection is very important in terms of reducing new cases and alleviating the load on the health-care system.

The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Process management through Good Farming Practices for animal production and Animal Welfare should be important preventive measures to avoid this contagion. In coronaviruses and Ebola there are ancestral hosts (such as bats) and intermediate hosts (such as Civettictis civetta or Paradoxurus hermaphroditus for SARS-CoV-1, dromedaries for MERS-CoV, and snakes and Manis javanica for SARS-CoV-2). In its natural state the inter-specie jump would take much longer to occur; however, the existence of wet markets, where animals are traded, would have allowed viruses to find a new host in humans. In addition to pneumonia, the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 produces temporary discomfort, such as diarrhea, due to the abundance of the ACE-2 receptor in both lung cells and enterocytes, where its replication would increase the probability of transmission by the fecal-oral route. This risk could be minimized by improving Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) procedures in the food industry. Future research should clarify the relationship between viruses and their hosts, as well as the effect of climate change and proteins availability for human consumption, on these pandemics. © 2020 All rights reserved.","Animal welfare; COVID-19; Domestic animals; Food safety; Good livestock practices; Good manufacturing practices; Wet markets",,,"Scientia Agropecu.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087442668

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with severe threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed at reviewing the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. We also focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear not to have higher risks of infection and worse outcomes in COVID-19 than the general population in an attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interrogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Besides, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L other receptors, and phosphorylated α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny, including ""cytokine storm""prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, and viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions. Using the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility, and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored. © 2020 Iolanda Valentina Popa et al.",,"artificial intelligence; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; human; immunosuppressive treatment; infection risk; inflammatory bowel disease; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; patient care; Review; risk assessment; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"Gastroenterol.

SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) is a coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with mild to severe respiratory illness. It is a highly contagious disease transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces, mainly through respiratory droplets, but other routes are being investigated. Objective. It is known that coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause a variety of ocular pathologies in animals, including conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis, many of which are severe. However, there is no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 presence in the eye tissue of asymptomatic patients, even if the symptomatic incidence is low. This systematic review presents updated literature on this issue. Abbreviated description of the state of knowledge. COVID-19 has now spread throughout the continents and poses a global threat to public health. The risk of rapidly overloading health care systems and causing substantial mortality worldwide is real. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced coronavirus as a global pandemic. Several studies described a few cases with initial ocular symptoms followed by systemic symptoms of the disease. Summary. Although the frequency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the eye is low, ocular symptoms are not uncommon in COVID-19. In some cases, eye symptoms may be the first signs of illness. This implies the need for hygienic recommendations and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff and other services to minimize COVID-19 infection of both health-care workers and patients. A triage for ophthalmic outpatient clinic is mandatory. © 2020, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19. © The author(s).

Bacterial or fungal superinfections of the lung may cause complications in clinical manifestations, treatment, and increase the mortality rate. In this article, we reviewed previous studies on invasive aspergillosis (IA) in viral infections and in adjustment with COVID-19. Also, the necessity of IA diagnosis to increase the survival rate in involved patients is discussed. Materials and methods: Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, invasive aspergillosis, and invasive fungal infections. Results: Reports from China showed 3.2% to 27.1% fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 who developed severe pneumonia were found with considerably higher rates of viral, bacterial, and fungal co-infections than those with mild pneumonia. Also, intestinal normal fungal flora was reported to be significantly different between COVID-19 patients and normal subjects. Conclusion: While the main focus of physicians is on bacterial superinfection control in COVID-19, ignoring life threatening fungal infections may increase the mortality rate. Therefore, we profoundly recommend early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

These viruses come into contact with the airways either by direct projection, by secondary inhalation of airborne droplets, or by handling (fomites). The objective of this article is to clarify the mechanisms of production and penetration of droplets of secretions emitted during all expiratory phenomena likely to transport these viruses and come into contact with the respiratory mucosa. The droplets > 5 μm follow the laws of ballistics, those < 5 μm follow Brownian motion and remain suspended in the air. The aerosols of droplets are very heterogeneous whether the subject is healthy or sick. During an infectious period, not all droplets contain viral RNA. If these RNAs are detectable around patients, on surfaces, and in the ambient air at variable distances according to the studies (from 0.5 m to beyond the patient's room), this is without prejudice to the infectious nature (viability) of the virus and the minimum infectious dose. There is a time lag between the patient's infectious period and that of RNA detection for both viruses. Subsequently, the inhaled particles must meet the laws of fluid dynamics (filtration) to settle in the respiratory tree. All of this partly explains the contagiousness and the clinical expression of these two viruses from the olfactory cleft to the alveoli. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Airborne particle; COVID-19; Influenza virus; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Eur.

Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain as the major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faecal samples after the virus converting to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation antedating respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestation have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance. In this review, we summarise recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of faecal–oral transmission, GI and liver manifestation, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19 and the diagnosis, management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases as well as precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during GI endoscopy procedures. © The Author(s), 2020.","COVID-19; endoscopy; gastrointestinal manifestation; inflammatory bowel disease","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor; aspartate aminotransferase; azathioprine; bilirubin; methotrexate; prednisone; tofacitinib; abdominal pain; adult respiratory distress syndrome; airborne infection; anorexia; anosmia; autopsy; bloody diarrhea; Clostridioides difficile; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease transmission; dyspnea; gastrointestinal symptom; health care personnel; hepatitis B; hospitalization; human; inflammatory bowel disease; liver function test; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nausea; nonalcoholic fatty liver; occult blood; occult blood test; priority journal; protein expression; rectum carcinoma; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; viral gastroenteritis; virus hepatitis; virus transmission; vomiting",,"Ther.

Methods: Observational studies in COVID-19 patients reporting data on raised body mass index at admission and associated clinical outcomes were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library up to 16 May 2020. Mean differences and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were aggregated using random effects models. Results: Eight retrospective cohort studies and one cohort prospective cohort study with data on of 4,920 patients with COVID-19 were eligible. Comparing BMI ≥ 25 vs &lt;25 kg/m2, the RRs (95% CIs) of severe illness and mortality were 2.35 (1.43-3.86) and 3.52 (1.32-9.42), respectively. In a pooled analysis of three studies, the RR (95% CI) of severe illness comparing BMI &gt; 35 vs &lt;25 kg/m2 was 7.04 (2.72-18.20). High levels of statistical heterogeneity were partly explained by age; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 was associated with an increased risk of severe illness in older age groups (≥60 years), whereas the association was weaker in younger age groups (&lt;60 years). Conclusions: Excess adiposity is a risk factor for severe disease and mortality in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was particularly pronounced in people 60 and older. The increased risk of worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with excess adiposity should be taken into account when considering individual and population risks and when deciding on which groups to target for public health messaging on prevention and detection measures.

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) responses were either found earlier than IgG, or together with IgG, later than IgG, or were missing. Therefore, clear distinctions between early, intermediate, and past infections are obviously not possible merely on the basis of IgM and IgG determinations. A review of publications on the serology of other virus groups shows that variable IgM responses can be found as well and therefore are not unique for SARS-CoV-2 infections. A model to explain this variability is proposed. The inclusion of avidity determination into regular diagnostic procedures has allowed to resolve such “atypical” serological constellations. The potential use of avidity determination for the diagnosis of COVID-19, for risk assessment, epidemiological studies, analysis of cross reactions, as well as for the control of vaccination programs is suggested and discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

However, so far, developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection kits or vaccines has remained elusive. In this regard, the development of antiviral nanomaterials by surface engineering with enhanced specificity might prove valuable to combat this novel virus.

The recent outbreak in Wuhan (December 2019), China, represents a beta coronavirus classified as novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Novel SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant similarity with previous coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV in 2002, China and MERS-CoV in 2015, Middle East. However, preliminary research investigations have shown the novel SARS-CoV-2 evolved with several mutations and developed the capacity to cross the species, i.e., animal to human. The initial findings have shown that spike proteins are vital molecules target hACE2 receptor for its attachment and entry into cells. After successful entry virus primarily focuses on respiratory airway cell lines and triggers a massive immune response leading to mucus generation. In severe conditions, the virus is capable of forcing viral pneumonia leading to the collapse of the respiratory system, i.e., COVID19. So far, there is a lack of immunity against the virus in humans. At the same in the absence of therapeutic interventions, many countries experienced high mortality, such as the United States, European countries, i.e., Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. The vaccine development is underway and experiencing challenges, as many reports demonstrated genetic variations in viral genome and proteins as well. The present study provides a complete comprehensive overview of the novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, human transmission, and global spread. © 2020 Chongqing Medical University","Centre for disease prevention and control; COVID19; Diagnosis; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Therapeutics; Vaccines; World Health Organization",,,"Genes Dis.",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087982137

Pneumonia cases were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Inoculation of respiratory samples into human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh7 cell lines, led to the isolation of a novel respiratory virus whose genome analysis showed it to be a novel coronavirus related to SARS-CoV, and therefore named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the thousands of deaths caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on 12 March 2020. To date, the world has paid a high toll in this pandemic in terms of human lives lost, economic repercussions and increased poverty. In this review, we provide information regarding the epidemiology, serological and molecular diagnosis, origin of SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to infect human cells, and safety issues.

This review examines the evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients, and the specific risks associated with aerosol-generating procedures. Protective measures, such as minimization of aerosols and use of personal protective equipment in the setting of treating asymptomatic patients, are also reviewed. Source: We examined the published literature as well as Societal guidelines. Principal findings: There is evidence that a proportion of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 have detectable viral loads prior to exhibiting symptoms, or without ever developing symptoms. The degree of risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients to healthcare providers will depend on the prevalence of disease in the population, which is difficult to assess without widespread population screening. Aerosol-generating procedures increase the odds of viral transmission from infected symptomatic patients to healthcare providers, but transmission from asymptomatic patients has not been reported. Techniques to minimize aerosolization and appropriate personal protective equipment may help reduce the risk to healthcare workers in the operating room. Some societal guidelines recommend the use of airborne precautions during aerosol-generating procedures on asymptomatic patients during the coronavirus disease pandemic, although evidence supporting this practice is limited. Conclusion: Viral transmission from patients exhibiting no symptoms in the operating room is plausible and efforts to reduce risk to healthcare providers include reducing aerosolization and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, the feasibility of which will vary based on geographic risk and equipment availability. © 2020, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.","asymptomatic; carrier; COVID19; SARS-CoV-2; transmission",,"32488493","Can.

Although there are few publications, COVID-19 patients, especially severely ill or immunocompromised, have a higher probability of suffering from invasive mycoses. Aspergillus and Candida infections in COVID-19 patients will require early detection by a comprehensive diagnostic intervention (histopathology, direct microscopic examination, culture, (1,3)-β-d-glucan, galactomannan, and PCR-based assays) to ensure effective treatments. We suggest it is prudent to assess the risk factors, the types of invasive mycosis, the strengths and limitations of diagnostic methods, clinical settings, and the need for standard or individualized treatment in COVID-19 patients.

A lack of personal protective equipment and protocols at the time of the outbreak led to many fatalities. Although few of these healthcare workers are dental professionals, this community required protective measures as well. Fortunately, there are no reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in dental practices. Dental professionals were advised only to treat dental emergencies, and such cases were screened via telephone to maintain social distancing. Nevertheless, new protocols and measures are needed as dental professionals return to normal practice after weeks of confinement in many countries. Relatively, few articles have discussed the management of dental practice during the SARS-CoV-2 with no known articles on postpandemic outbreak guidelines.

The safety of PVP-I topically applied to the nasal and oral cavity is addressed by a literature review. The specific efficacy of PVP-I against coronaviruses and its potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is discussed. Methods: A review was performed utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Databases. All citations in protocols for nasal and oral PVP-I use regarding COVID-19 were independently reviewed. Results: Povidone-iodine has been safely administered for up to 5 months in the nasal cavity and 6 months in the oral cavity. Concentrations less than 2.5% in vitro do not reduce ciliary beat frequency or cause pathological changes in ciliated nasal epithelium, upper respiratory, or mucosal cells. Adverse events with oral use have not been reported in conscious adults or children. Allergy and contact sensitivity is rare. Chronic mucosal use up to 5% has not been shown to result in clinical thyroid disease. PVP-I is rapidly virucidal and inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Conclusions: Povidone-iodine can safely be used in the nose at concentrations up to 1.25% and in the mouth at concentrations up to 2.5% for up to 5 months. Povidone-iodine rapidly inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS, when applied for as little as 15 seconds.

Urticaria is constituted by evanescent erythematous-edematous lesions (wheals and flare), which does not persist in the same site for more than 24 to 48 hours and appears in other topographic localization, resolving without residual hyper pigmentation. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, some cytokines are synthesized, including Interferon (IFN) type I, TNF-α, and chemokines which may induce mast cells (MCs) and basophils degranulation by mechanisms similar to the autoinflammatory monogenic or polygenic diseases. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of the urticaria and urticarial-like lesions in the COVID-19's era, besides other aspects related to innate and adaptative immune response to viral infections, interactions between dermal dendritic cells and MCs, and degranulation of MCs by different stimuli. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells share, in allergic patients, expression of the high-affinity IgE receptors on cell membranes and demonstrated a low pattern of type I IFN secretion in viral infections.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, drew special attention towards this virus once again. The intermediate host of this novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is yet to be determined, but it has a very close genomic relationship with the bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV), RaTG13 strain, and the pangolin coronaviruses.

With the rapid increase in the number of infections, an increase is observed in the number of children with COVID-19. Most research findings are regarding adult cases, which are not always transferrable to children. Evidence-based studies are still expected to formulate clinical decisions for pediatric patients. In this review, we included 2597 pediatric patients that reported recently and evaluated the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID-19. We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults; it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to occur in pediatric patients. Our analysis may contribute to determine the spectrum of disease in children and to develop strategies to control the disease transmission. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2019-nCoV; children; COVID-19; pediatric patients; SARS-CoV-2",,"32418216","J.

Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. Recent developments: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. Where next?: Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,"32622375","Lancet Neurol.",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087743078

Information on the infection risks for pregnant women and their offspring have so far been limited to small case series, until a large UK report on 427 SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women was published. Previous SARS epidemic experiences were drawn upon. Diagnostic use of real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and IgG and IgM antibody tests are fraught with concerns of non-validation and false negative results, as are sampling methodologies. Virtually no information on controls ac-company these reports. Infection of the mother and baby has serious implications for obstetric and neonatal care. Information on early and late stage pregnancy infection and the relationship to severity of infection on fetal development is both useful and clearly warranted. An increasing number of reports centre around mildly infected women showing no evidence of fetal infection while a few reports suggesting vertical transmission require further validation. Vertical transmission from mother to baby however small would have profound health implications for obstetric and neonatal care and fetal abnormalities.

Four human coronaviruses (hCoVs)—229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43—circulate globally, commonly infect children and typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three novel coronaviruses of zoonotic origin have emerged during the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These novel coronaviruses are known to cause severe illness and death predominantly in older adults and those with underlying comorbidities. Consistent with what has been observed during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, children with COVID-19 are more likely to be asymptomatic or to have mild-to-moderate illness, with few deaths reported in children globally thus far. Clinical symptoms and laboratory and radiological abnormalities in children have been similar to those reported in adults but are generally less severe. A rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which has resulted in critical illness and some deaths has recently been described. Clinical trials for therapeutics and vaccine development should include paediatric considerations. Children may play an important role in the transmission of infection and outbreak dynamics and could be a key target population for effective measures to control outbreaks. The unintended consequences of the unprecedented scale and duration of pandemic control measures for children and families around the world should be carefully examined.

In our recent study, we explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for clinical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection compared with qRT-PCR using the same primer/probe sets issued by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) targeting viral ORF1ab or N gene, which showed that ddPCR could largely minimize the false negatives reports resulted by qRT-PCR [Suo T, Liu X, Feng J, et al. ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens. medRxiv [Internet]. 2020;2020.02.29.20029439.

Here, we further stringently compared the performance of qRT-PCR and ddPCR for 8 primer/probe sets with the same clinical samples and conditions. Results showed that none of 8 primer/probe sets used in qRT-PCR could significantly distinguish true negatives and positives with low viral load (10−4 dilution). Moreover, false positive reports of qRT-PCR with UCDC-N1, N2 and CCDC-N primers/probes sets were observed. In contrast, ddPCR showed significantly better performance in general for low viral load samples compared to qRT-PCR. Remarkably, the background readouts of ddPCR are relatively lower, which could efficiently reduce the production of false positive reports. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

An extensive literature search was performed to identify papers on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) in children, published between January 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. There were 44 relevant papers on COVID-19 in children. The results showed that COVID-19 occurs in 0.39–12.3% of children. Clinical signs and symptoms are comparable to those in adults, but milder forms and a large percentage of asymptomatic carriers are found among children. Elevated inflammatory markers are associated with complications and linked to various co-infections. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans in children revealed structural changes similar to those found in adults, with consolidations surrounded by halos being somewhat specific for children with COVID-19. The recommended treatment includes providing symptomatic therapy, with no specific drug recommendations for children. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults. This review highlights that COVID-19 in children is similar to the disease in the adult population, but with particularities regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, chest imaging, and treatment.

Physical properties of surfaces and spike-glycoprotein are correlated with the reported stability of SARS-CoV-2. The spike-protein is reported to be hydrophobic in nature with an isoelectric point of 5.9. Hence surface with both positive charge and hydrophobic groups are expected to achieve a strong binding with the surface spike-protein. Various surface engineering strategies of polypropylene and other materials with hybrid self-assembled monolayers and dopamine are discussed to design the mixed hydrophobic and charged surfaces. The strong surface-protein interactions may lead to severe conformational changes and destabilization of the viral envelope, which can disintegrate and inactivate the novel coronavirus. © 2020 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","conformational changes; Coronavirus; hybrid self-Assembled monolayers; polypropylene; PPEs; SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein; surface modification","Amines; Hybrid materials; Hydrophobicity; Polypropylenes; Protective clothing; Proteins; Surface chemistry; Viruses; Conformational change; Contacting surfaces; Engineered surfaces; Hydrophobic groups; Iso-electric points; Personal protective equipment; Positive charges; Surface engineering; Diseases",,"Surf Eng",Letter,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088931274

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. Observations: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. Conclusions and Relevance: As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.. © 2020 American Medical Association.

The classic symptoms of the disease have been well defined by the World Health Organization; however, olfactory/gustatory disorders have been reported in some studies, but there are still several missing points in the understanding and in the consensus about the clinical management of these cases. Objective: To identify evidence in the scientific literature about olfactory/gustatory disorders, their clinical presentation, prevalence and possible specific treatments associated with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review of articles published up to April 25, 2020 was performed in Medline, Cochrane Clinical Trials, ScienceDirect, Lilacs, Scopus and Google Schoolar, OpenGrey.eu, DissOnline, The New York Academy of Medicine and Reasearch Gate. Inclusion criteria: (1) Studies on patients with COVID-19; (2) Records of COVID-19 signs/symptoms, and olfactory/gustatory functions. Exclusion criteria: (1) Studies on non-human coronavirus; (2) Review articles; (3) Experimental studies (in animals or in vitro); (4) Olfactory/gustatory disorders initiated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk assessment of bias of the selected studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Six articles from the 1788 records met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. A total of 1457 patients of different ethnicities were assessed; of them, 885 (60.7%) and 822 (56.4%) had smell and taste disorders, respectively, with women being most often affected. There were olfactory/gustatory disorders even without nasal obstruction/rhinorrhea and beginning even before the signs/symptoms of COVID-19; the recovery of smell/taste, when it occurs, usually happened in the first two weeks after COVID-19 resolution. There is evidence that olfactory/gustatory disorders are strong predictors of infection by SARS-CoV-2, and it is possible to recommend patient isolation, as early as of the medical consultation, preventing the spread of the virus. No scientific evidence has been identified for effective treatments for any of the disorders. Conclusion: Olfactory/gustatory disorders may occur at varying intensities and prior to the general symptoms of COVID-19 and should be considered as part of the clinical features of COVID-19, even in mild cases. There is still no scientific evidence of specific treatments for such disorders in COVID-19 disease. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cérvico-Facial","COVID-19; Olfaction disorders; Olfactory disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Taste disorders",,,"Brazilian J.

Despite growing knowledge of the nature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), treatment options are still poorly defined. The safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically ibuprofen, has been openly questioned without any supporting evidence or clarity over dose, duration, or temporality of administration. This has been further conflicted by the initiation of studies to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen in improving outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients. To clarify the scientific reality, a literature search was conducted alongside considerations of the pharmacological properties of ibuprofen in order to construct this narrative review. The literature suggests that double-blind, placebo-controlled study results must be reported and carefully analysed for safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19 before any recommendations can be made regarding the use of ibuprofen in such patients. Limited studies have suggested: (i) no direct interactions between ibuprofen and SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) there is no evidence to suggest ibuprofen affects the regulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for COVID-19, in human studies. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest ibuprofen may facilitate cleavage of ACE2 from the membrane, preventing membrane-dependent viral entry into the cell, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. Additionally, in vitro evidence suggests that inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) by ibuprofen may have a role in reducing excess inflammation or cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Finally, there is no evidence that ibuprofen will aggravate or increase the chance of infection of COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s).","ACE2; COVID-19; Ibuprofen; Immune system; Safety; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Inflammopharmacology",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089373362

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, is highly contagious and has rapidly expanded worldwide since its discovery. Quantitative nucleic acid testing has become the gold standard for diagnosis and guiding clinical decisions regarding the use of antiviral therapy. However, the RT-qPCR assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 have a number of challenges, especially in terms of primer design. Primers are the pivotal components of a RT-qPCR assay. Once virus mutation and recombination occur, it is difficult to effectively diagnose viral infection by existing RT-qPCR primers. Some primers and probes have also been made available on the WHO website for reference. However, no previous review has systematically compared the previously reported primers and probes and described how to design new primers in the event of a new coronavirus infection. This review focuses on how primers and probes can be designed methodically and rationally, and how the sensitivity and specificity of the detection process can be improved. This brief review will be useful for the accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of the new coronavirus pneumonia. © The author(s).

This systemic involvement is postulated to be mainly related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors located on several different human cells. Lung involvement is the most common serious manifestation of the disease, ranging from asymptomatic disease or mild pneumonia, to severe disease associated with hypoxia, critical disease associated with shock, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure or death. Among patients with COVID-19, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and especially cardiovascular disease, has been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas the emergence of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias, has been associated with poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also frequently encountered and may persist for several days. Haematological complications are frequent as well and have been associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, recent studies have reported that over a third of infected patients develop a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscles, including anosmia and ageusia.

Methods: A literature search was performed using combination of keywords (MeSH terms and free text words) relating to COVID-19, urology, faeces and stool on multiple databases. Primary outcomes were the urological manifestations of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in urine and stool samples. Meta-analyses were performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same outcome. Special considerations in urological conditions that were relevant in the pandemic of COVID-19 were reported in a narrative manner. Results: There were a total of 21 studies with 3714 COVID-19 patients, and urinary symptoms were absent in all of them. In patients with COVID-19, 7.58% (95% CI 3.30–13.54%) developed acute kidney injury with a mortality rate of 93.27% (95% CI 81.46–100%) amongst them. 5.74% (95% CI 2.88–9.44%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in urine samples, but the duration of viral shedding in urine was unknown. 65.82% (95% CI 45.71–83.51%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in stool samples, which were detected from 2 to 47 days from symptom onset. 31.6% of renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 required non-invasive ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury leading to mortality is common amongst COVID-19 patients, likely as a result of direct viral toxicity. Viral RNA positivity was detected in both urine and stool samples, so precautions are needed when we perform transurethral or transrectal procedures. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Acute kidney injury; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Stool; Urine; Urology; Viral RNA",,,"World J.

Diagnosis is usually via real-time PCR, and it is unclear whether the semi-quantitative capability of this method, determining viral load through cycle threshold (Ct) values, can be leveraged. Objectives: We aim to review available knowledge on correlations between SARS-COV-2 Ct values and patient- or healthcare-related outcomes to determine whether Ct values provide useful clinical information. Sources: A PubMed search was conducted on 1 June 2020 based on a search strategy of (Ct value OR viral load) AND SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values, or viral loads determined via Ct value, and clinical outcomes. Content: Data from 18 studies were relevant for inclusion. One study reported on the correlation between Ct values and mortality and one study reported on the correlation between Ct values and progression to severe disease; both reported a significant association (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Fourteen studies reported on the correlation between Ct value or viral loads determined via Ct value and disease severity, and an association was observed in eight (57%) studies. Studies reporting on the correlation of viral load with biochemical and haematological markers showed an association with at least one marker, including increased lactate dehydrogenase (n = 4), decreased lymphocytes (n = 3) and increased high-sensitivity troponin I (n = 2). Two studies reporting on the correlation with infectivity showed that lower Ct values were associated with higher viral culture positivity. Implications: Data suggest that lower Ct values may be associated with worse outcomes and that Ct values may be useful in predicting the clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19; however, further studies are warranted to confirm clinical value. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Cycle threshold; PCR; SARS-CoV-2; Viral load",,,"Infect.

The scientific effort to understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical impact has been huge, and important achievements are highlighted in this review. Diagnosis is central and is the first step in recognizing and fighting any infectious agent. Instrumental to that is the quality of the data, relying on serological and molecular surveys in addition to trustworthy clinical records. However, the fast spread of a virus adapted for human-to-human respiratory transmission raised a demand for millions of molecular tests that are simply not available. Several candidate drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials. Those with an already recognized safety profile are more auspicious, since, if proven effective, can cut several steps of production and phase 2 and 3 trials. More than one hundred vaccine prototypes are in different stages of development, however, safety and efficacy evaluations cannot be obviated, implicating, most optimistically, in at least months for us to have an effective immunization, the definite measure to allow a safe return to the pre-pandemic lifestyle.

Over the last decade, substantial research into the presence, abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper, we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the known information about SARSCoV-2 to provide actionable and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize infectious disease transmission through environmentally mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to corporate and public administrators and individuals responsible for building operations and environmental services in their decision-making process about the degree and duration of social-distancing measures during viral epidemics and pandemics.

At the end of 2019, another novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hit Wuhan, a city in the center of China, and subsequently spread rapidly to the whole world. Latest reports revealed that more than 800 thousand people in over 200 countries are involved in the epidemic disease by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high mortality rate and the lack of optimum therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the biological characteristics of the virus and its possible pathogenesis to respond to the SARS-CoV-2. Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control. However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics.

ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Additionally, understanding the potential mechanisms of neurologic injury may guide efforts to better detect and ameliorate these complications. In this review, we synthesize a range of clinical observations and initial case series describing potential neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 and place these observations in the context of coronavirus neuro-pathophysiology as it may relate to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reported nervous system manifestations range from anosmia and ageusia, to cerebral hemorrhage and infarction. While the volume of COVID-19-related case studies continues to grow, previous work examining related viruses suggests potential mechanisms through which the novel coronavirus may impact the CNS and result in neurological complications. Namely, animal studies examining the SARS-CoV have implicated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 receptor as a mediator of coronavirus-related neuronal damage and have shown that SARS-CoV can infect cerebrovascular endothelium and brain parenchyma, the latter predominantly in the medial temporal lobe, resulting in apoptosis and necrosis. Human postmortem brain studies indicate that human coronavirus variants and SARS-CoV can infect neurons and glia, implying SARS-CoV-2 may have similar neurovirulence. Additionally, studies have demonstrated an increase in cytokine serum levels as a result of SARS-CoV infection, consistent with the notion that cytokine overproduction and toxicity may be a relevant potential mechanism of neurologic injury, paralleling a known pathway of pulmonary injury. We also discuss evidence that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be a vasculotropic and neurotropic virus. Early reports suggest COVID-19 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, and several plausible mechanisms exist to account for these observations. A heightened awareness of the potential for neurologic involvement and further investigation into the relevant pathophysiology will be necessary to understand and ultimately mitigate SARS-CoV-2-associated neurologic injury. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.","Cerebrovascular stroke; Coronavirus; Inflammation; Neurology",,,"Neurocrit.

The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritised development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomised controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities.

The causative agent has been recognized as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily affecting the respiratory tract. To date, no vaccines are available nor any specific treatment. To limit the number of infections, strict directives have been issued by governments that have been translated into equally rigorous guidelines notably for post-mortem examinations by international and national scientific societies. The recommendations for biosafety control required during specimen collection and handling have strongly limited the practice of autopsies of the COVID-19 patients to a few adequate laboratories. A full pathological examination has always been considered an important tool to better understand the pathophysiology of diseases, especially when the knowledge of an emerging disorder is limited and the impact on the healthcare system is significant. The first evidence of diffuse alveolar damage in the context of an acute respiratory distress syndrome has now been joined by the latest findings that report a more complex scenario in COVID-19, including a vascular involvement and a wide spectrum of associated pathologies. Ancillary tools such as electron microscopy and molecular biology used on autoptic tissue samples from autopsy are also significantly contributing to confirm and/or identify new aspects useful for a deeper knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms. This article will review and summarize the pathological findings described in COVID-19 until now, chiefly focusing on the respiratory tract, highlighting the importance of autopsy towards a better knowledge of this disease. © 2020, The Author(s).","Autopsy; COVID-19; Lung; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Virchows Arch.",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087677421

Methods: A comprehensive electronic search was done through PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to May 22, 2020, along with the reference list of all included studies. All cohort studies that reported on outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy were included. Qualitative assessment of included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Upon admission, most pregnant women underwent a low-dose radiation CT scan; the reports of which included unilateral/bilateral pneumonia in most patients. A marked lymphopenia was also noted in many patients with COVID-19. 513 titles were screened, and 22 studies were included, which identified 156 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 108 neonatal outcomes. The most common maternal/foetal complications included intrauterine/foetal distress (14%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The neonatal clinical manifestations of COVID-19 commonly included shortness of breath (6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (4%), and fever (3%). Conclusion: COVID-19 infection in pregnancy leads to increased risk in pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, PPROM, and may possibly lead to maternal death in rare cases. There is no evidence to support vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the unborn child. Due to a paucity of inconsistent data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the newborn, caution should be undertaken to further investigate and monitor possible infection in the neonates born to COVID-19-infected mothers. © 2020 S.

The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. The viral genome was sequenced and a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was developed and used for the detection of virus. Different countries took different approaches for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Some countries prioritized extensive testing for COVID-19 at a very early phase of the pandemic whereas other countries took a long time to build the testing capacity and to implement the testing extensively. The assay design formats were available in the public domain and thereby allowing researchers to replicate them to make diagnostic kits. Consequently, several antigen or antibody-based diagnostic tests were also developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, there were some validation and regulatory challenges while bringing these assays into the market. During the course of the pandemic, it became clear that the countries which implemented testing at an early stage of the pandemic were capable of controlling the spread more effectively than those that implemented them at later stages. As several countries implemented a lockdown for controlling the spread of the virus, it is critical to build the testing capability to meet the extensive need of testing while exiting the lockdown. Testing and isolation of positive cases are the most effective ways of preventing the spread of virus and gradually returning life back to normality. © 2020, Indian Virological Society.","Antibody; Antigen; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Laboratory testing; RT-qPCR; SARS CoV-2; Serological test",,,"VirusDisease",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089157252

No effective treatment is yet in sight for this catastrophic illness. Several antiviral agents and vaccines are in clinical trials, and drug repurposings as immediate and alternative choices are also under consideration. Immunomodulatory agents like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as well as biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such as tocilizumab and anakinra received worldwide attention for treatment of critical patients with COVID-19. This is of interest to rheumatologists, who are well versed with rational use of these agents. This brief review addresses the understandings of some of the common immunopathogenetic mechanisms in the context of autoimmune rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and COVID-19. Apart from demographic comparisons, the role of type I interferons (IFN), presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and finally mechanism of action of HCQ in both the scenarios are discussed here. High risks for fatal disease in COVID-19 include older age, metabolic syndrome, male gender, and individuals who develop delayed type I IFN response. HCQ acts by different mechanisms including prevention of cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of type I IFN signaling. Recent controversies regarding efficacy of HCQ in management of COVID-19 warrant more studies in that direction. Autoantibodies were also reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as in COVID-19.

The first coronaviruses – members of the Coronaviridae family belonging to the order Nidovirales — were discovered in the first half of the last century. The first human coronavirus, HCoV-B814, was isolated in 1965 that was not preserved in available virological collections. Over the last time, old-fashioned names and terms have been overlapped. By the beginning of the XXI century coronaviruses posed a serious veterinary problem but it was believed that epidemic coronaviruses were not among highly dangerous viruses.

Since then pathogenic human coronaviruses were identified beginning with the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2002. With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (a,b,g,d), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under a-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and b-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a b-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3’ end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E,-HKU1,-NL63 and-OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

NSP3 has the property to block host innate immune response and to promote cytokine expression. NSP5 can inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and NSP16 prevents MAD5 recognition, depressing the innate immunity. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a ‘cytokine storm’.

This illness emerged as an epidemic in China and later spread to almost all countries over the globe except Antarctica. This is caused by a beta Corona virus, which is genetically similar to SARS virus. The predominant mode of transmission is via droplet spread, when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks the virus is released in the respiratory secretions. As there are only a few cases of COVID 19 in neonates, there is no convincing evidence to support the possibility of vertical transmission. Clinical presentation in neonates is nonspecific, commonly observed are temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific. Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Given the current, urgent, and dire need for effective therapies against novel coronavirus-19, this approach is particularly appealing. Areas covered: Here, we review the significant anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties of minocycline as potential mechanisms for efficacy against the novel coronavirus and highlight the promises and pitfalls of this approach. Expert opinion: As compared to other agents being investigated for COVID-19, minocycline offers distinct advantages in terms of potential efficacy in patients with life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocardial injury, well-known safety and interaction profile, relatively low costs, and widespread availability.

The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This includes rituximab, oblinutuzumab and ofatumumab that are used in cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and off-label in a large number of other autoimmunities and ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic created concerns about immunosuppression in autoimmunity, leading to cessation or a delay in immunotherapy treatments. However, based on the known and emerging biology of autoimmunity and COVID-19, it was hypothesised that while B cell depletion should not necessarily expose people to severe SARS-CoV-2-related issues, it may inhibit protective immunity following infection and vaccination. As such, drug-induced B cell subset inhibition, that controls at least some autoimmunities, would not influence innate and CD8 T cell responses, which are central to SARS-CoV-2 elimination, nor the hypercoagulation and innate inflammation causing severe morbidity. This is supported clinically, as the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected, CD20-depleted people with autoimmunity have recovered. However, protective neutralizing antibody and vaccination responses are predicted to be blunted until naive B cells repopulate, based on B cell repopulation kinetics and vaccination responses, from published rituximab and unpublished ocrelizumab (NCT00676715, NCT02545868) trial data, shown here. This suggests that it may be possible to undertake dose interruption to maintain inflammatory disease control, while allowing effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-29, if and when an effective vaccine is available. © 2020 The Authors.

The 2019-nCoV can survive for up to 9 days at 25 °C, and if this temperature rises to 30 °C, its lifespan will be shorter. The 2019-nCoV is sensitive to humidity, and lifespan of viruses in 50% humidity is longer than that of 30%.

This disorder is not typical DIC. Rather, it might be more similar to complement-mediated TMA syndromes, which are well known to rheumatologists who care for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. This perspective has critical implications for treatment. Anticoagulation and antiviral agents are standard treatments for DIC but are gravely insufficient for any of the TMA disorders that involve disorders of complement.

The basic reproductive rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 2·5 (range 1·8–3·6) compared with 2·0–3·0 for SARS-CoV and the 1918 influenza pandemic, 0·9 for MERS-CoV, and 1·5 for the 2009 influenza pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes mild or asymptomatic disease in most cases; however, severe to critical illness occurs in a small proportion of infected individuals, with the highest rate seen in people older than 70 years. The measured case fatality rate varies between countries, probably because of differences in testing strategies. Population-based mortality estimates vary widely across Europe, ranging from zero to high. Numbers from the first affected region in Italy, Lombardy, show an all age mortality rate of 154 per 100 000 population. Differences are most likely due to varying demographic structures, among other factors. However, this new virus has a focal dissemination; therefore, some areas have a higher disease burden and are affected more than others for reasons that are still not understood. Nevertheless, early introduction of strict physical distancing and hygiene measures have proven effective in sharply reducing R0 and associated mortality and could in part explain the geographical differences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,"32628905","Lancet Infect.

Although the knowledge on the clinical and epidemiology of COVID‐19 in pediatric patients is being accumulated rapidly, relevant comprehensive review on its radiological manifestations is still lacking. The present article reviews the radiological characteristics of COVID‐19 in pediatrics, based on the previous studies. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic literature search for published articles by using Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar and Embase online databases. All studies describing CT findings of COVID-19 in pediatrics (<18years) were included. Results: A total of 39 studies with 850 pediatric patients were reviewed. 225 (26.5%) of patients had normal CT findings. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were the most common CT abnormalities (384/625, 61.5%). Other findings were halo sign, interstitial opacities, bronchial wall thickening, and crazy-paving sign. Approximately 55% of patients had unilateral pulmonary findings. Most studies found peripheral and lower-lobe distribution to be a prominent imaging finding. Conclusion: Our study showed that imaging findings in children were often milder and more focal than adults, typically as ground-glass opacities and consolidations with unilateral lower-lobe predominance, which have been regressed during the recovery time. A balance must be struck between the risk of radiation and the need for chest CT. If still necessary, low-dose CT is more appropriate in this age group. Albeit, due to the limited number of reported pediatrics with COVID-19, and the lack of consistency in CT descriptors, further work is still needed in this regard. © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists","Chest imaging; Children; COVID-19; CT-scan; Lung; Pediatrics; Pneumonia; Radiation; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Acad.

Methods: Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. Results: The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. Recommendations: Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield. Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Early data have demonstrated how the host response to this novel coronavirus leads to the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, massive endothelial damage, and generalized vascular manifestations. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the upper and lower respiratory tract, other organ systems are also affected. SARS-CoV-2 relies on 2 host cell receptors for successful attachment: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2. Clinicopathologic reports have demonstrated associations between severe COVID-19 and viral coagulopathy, resulting in pulmonary embolism; venous, arterial, and microvascular thrombosis; lung endothelial injury; and associated thrombotic complications leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Viral coagulopathy is not novel given similar observations with SARS classic, including the consumption of platelets, generation of thrombin, and increased fibrin degradation product exhibiting overt disseminated intravascular coagulation–like syndrome. The specific mechanism(s) behind the thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients has yet to be fully understood. Parenteral anticoagulants, such as heparin and low-molecular-weights heparins, are widely used in the management of COVID-19 patients. Beyond the primary (anticoagulant) effects of these agents, they may exhibit antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects. Direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are also useful in the management of these patients. Tissue plasminogen activator and other fibrinolytic modalities may also be helpful in the overall management. Catheter-directed thrombolysis can be used in patients developing pulmonary embolism. Further investigations are required to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated thrombotic complications. © The Author(s) 2020.","acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); coagulopathy; COVID-19; disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); thrombosis","alteplase; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anticoagulant agent; argatroban; bivalirudin; D dimer; danaparoid; fibrin degradation product; fibrinogen; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; phospholipid antibody; sulodexide; thrombin; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; antithrombocytic agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; fibrinolytic agent; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood clotting disorder; catheter directed thrombolysis; clinical outcome; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; deep vein thrombosis; disseminated intravascular clotting; endothelium injury; erythrophagocytosis; heart injury; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; lung embolism; mechanical thrombectomy; pathogenesis; patient care; platelet count; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary prevention; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; blood; cardiovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; devices; drug effect; fibrinolytic therapy; lung embolism; multimodality cancer therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; peripheral occlusive artery disease; procedures; pulmonary artery catheterization; thrombophilia; vascular endothelium; vein thrombosis; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anticoagulants; Arterial Occlusive Diseases; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Catheterization, Swan-Ganz; Combined Modality Therapy; Coronavirus Infections; Endothelium, Vascular; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Pandemics; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Pneumonia, Viral; Pulmonary Embolism; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Thrombolytic Therapy; Thrombophilia; Venous Thrombosis; Virus Internalization","32687449","Clin.

This article uses the four ethical principles framework as a structured approach to come to a set of practical, ethically grounded guidelines for halting and relaunching clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework applied provides a structured approach for all clinical trials stakeholders and thereby prevents unclear reasoning in a complex situation. While it is essential to prevent the virus from resurging and focus on developing a COVID-19 treatment as soon as possible, it is just as important to our society that we continue developing new drugs for other conditions.

The current management of COVID-19 is based generally on supportive therapy and treatment to prevent respiratory failure. The effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under evaluation and development. Areas covered: A literature search was performed using PubMed between December 1, 2019–June 23, 2020. This review highlights the current state of knowledge on the viral replication and pathogenicity, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and management of COVID-19. This review will be of interest to scientists and clinicians and make a significant contribution toward development of vaccines and targeted therapies to contain the pandemic. Expert opinion: The exit strategy for a path back to normal life is required, which should involve a multi-prong effort toward development of new treatment and a successful vaccine to protect public health worldwide and prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks. Therefore, the bench to bedside translational research as well as reverse translational works focusing bedside to bench is very important and would provide the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 infections. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; diagnosis; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; treatment",,,"Expert Rev.

The fact that the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 as the cell entry receptor and that hypertension as well as cardiovascular disorders frequently coexist with COVID-19 have generated considerable discussion on the management of patients with hypertension. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of and adaptation to a “New Normal” lifestyle, which will have a profound impact not only on communicable diseases but also on noncommunicable diseases, including hypertension. Summarizing what is known and what requires further investigation in this field may help to address the challenges we face. In the present review, we critically evaluate the existing evidence for the epidemiological association between COVID-19 and hypertension. We also summarize the current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an emphasis on ACE2, the cardiovascular system, and the kidney. Finally, we review evidence on the use of antihypertensive medication, namely, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, in patients with COVID-19. © 2020, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cardiovascular disease; hypertension; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,,"Hypertens.

We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,"32719447","J.

Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted. © The author(s).","Animal reservoir; Bats; Coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2","animal; bat; Betacoronavirus; China; classification; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease carrier; host pathogen interaction; human; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; rodent; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; China; Chiroptera; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Reservoirs; Evolution, Molecular; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rodentia; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Zoonoses","32226286","Int.

In this review, the main transmission routes and causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review was carried out to recognize relevant research available until 10 April 2020. RESULTS: The main transmission routes of COVID-19 have been the following: Animal to human and human-to-human pathways, namely: Respiratory transmission; oro-fecal transmission; air, surface-human transmission. Transmission from asymptomatic persons, healthcare transmission, and interfamily transmission have been well documented. CONCLUSIONS: SARSCoV2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility. It is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets and close contact. The most probable transmission pathway is definitely the inter-human one. Asymptomatic patients seem to play a crucial role in spreading the infection. Because of COVID-19 infection pandemic potential, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity in order to gain an effective vaccine and flock immunity and reduce mortality as soon and as much as it is possible. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included ‘sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)’ as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. Results: Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine. © 2020 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society.","anosmia; chemosensory dysfunction; COVID-19; dysgeusia; loss of smell; Loss of taste; SARS-CoV-2",,,"Acta Odontol.

On February 11, 2019, the Internal Committee on Taxonomy of Virus (ICTV) announced the name of the novel virus as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of the proteins present on its membrane i.e. the Spike protein is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the host. It spreads through the salivary droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The best way to slow down the disease is by protecting self by washing hands and using the disinfectant. Most of the infected people experience mild to moderate breathing issues. Serious illness might develop in people with underlying cardiovascular problems, diabetes and other immuno-compromised diseases. To date, there is no effective medicine available in the market which is effective in COVID-19. However, healthcare professionals are using ritonavir, flavipiravir, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. Along with the medicines, some countries are using convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells for treatment. Till date, it has claimed millions of death worldwide.

While neonates are a special population, little is known about the neonatal outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes in COVID-19 positive neonates and incidence of vertical transmission of the virus by reviewing available literature. Study Design This study is a narrative review of available literature on COVID-19 in neonates, for which PubMed and Google Scholar were used to search the published articles. Results We summarized the data from 39 published studies that are comprised of 326 COVID-19 positive peripartum mothers with respective neonatal outcomes. Twenty-three neonates have been reported to be COVID-19 positive. Male neonates were affected significantly more (79%) than female neonates. Approximately 3% neonates acquired infection through suspected vertical transmission. Strict infection prevention measures during the perinatal time can significantly reduce the chance of horizontal transmission of the virus. Overall, neonates were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic regardless of gestational age at birth and required only supportive measures. There was 0% mortality in COVID-19 positive neonates. Conclusion From available published data to date, we can conclude that the prognosis of COVID-19 positive neonates is good with no mortality. There appears to be minimal vertical transmission of the infection. Key Points Majority of COVID-19 positive neonates showed mild clinical signs and symptoms with no mortality. Most COVID-19 positive neonates require only supportive measures. Possibility of viral vertical transmission is very low. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

An electronic survey was distributed globally to record the operational considerations to mitigate biosafety risks in the laboratory. Additionally, the laboratories were asked to indicate the operational challenges they faced. A total of 1210 valid submissions were included in this analysis. Most of the survey participants worked in hospital laboratories. Around 15% of laboratories restricted certain tests on patients with clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 over biosafety concerns. Just over 10% of the laboratories had to restrict their test menu or services due to resource constraints. Approximately a third of laboratories performed temperature monitoring, while two thirds of laboratories increased the frequency of disinfection. Just less than 50% of the laboratories split their teams. The greatest reported challenge faced by laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic is securing sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), analytical equipment, including those used at the point of care, as well as reagents, consumables and other laboratory materials. This was followed by having inadequate staff, managing their morale, anxiety and deployment. The restriction of tests and services may have undesirable clinical consequences as clinicians are deprived of important information to deliver appropriate care to their patients. Staff rostering and biosafety concerns require longer-term solutions as they are crucial for the continued operation of the laboratory during what may well be a prolonged pandemic. ©2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","biohazard; biosafety; COVID-19; laboratory management; SARS-CoV-2",,"32549122","Clin.

Whereas the initial detection of endemic human respiratory coronaviruses was problematic, detection of these and newly discovered human coronaviruses has been greatly facilitated with major advances in the laboratory. Nevertheless, technological factors can affect the accuracy and timeliness of virus detection. Many human coronaviruses can be variably found in stool samples. All human coronaviruses have been variably associated with symptoms of gastroenteritis. Coronaviruses can occasionally be cultured from enteric specimens, but most detection is accomplished with genetic amplification technologies. Excretion of viral RNA in stool can extend for a prolonged period. Culture-positive stool samples have been found to exceed a fourteen day period after onset of infection for some coronaviruses. Virus can also sometimes be cultured from patients' respiratory samples during the late incubation period. Relatively asymptomatic patients may excrete virus. Both viable and nonviable virus can be found in the immediate environment of the patient, the health care worker, and less often the public. These lessons from the past study of animal and human coronaviruses can be extended to presumptions for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Already, the early reports from the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic are confirming some concerns. These data have the cumulative potential to cause us to rethink some current and common public health and infection control strategies. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronavirus; COVID-19; gastrointestinal; infection; SARS-CoV-2",,"32462689","J.

Our aim was to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Methods: PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through 20 June 2020, for case reports and case series reporting pediatric COVID-19 cases. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed to compare by age. Results: Our search identified 46 eligible case reports and case series. A total of 114 pediatric cases with COVID-19 were included. The main clinical features were mild symptoms including fever (64%), cough (35%), and rhinorrhea (16%), or no symptoms (15%). Ground-like opacities were common radiological findings (54%). The main laboratory findings were lymphopenia (33%) and elevated D-dimer (52%) and C-reactive protein (40%) levels. We identified 17 patients (15%) with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifesting with symptoms overlapping with, but distinct from, Kawasaki disease, including gastrointestinal symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, shock, and marked elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Twelve percent of the patients including 65% of the MIS-C cases required intensive care because of hypotension. No deaths were reported. Conclusion: This systematic review found that children with COVID-19 are generally less severe or asymptomatic. However, infants might be seriously ill and older children might develop MIS-C with severe illness. Early detection of children with mild symptoms or an asymptomatic state and early diagnosis of MIS-C are mandatory for the management of COVID-19 and the prevention of transmission and a severe inflammatory state. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","clinical features; COVID-19; Kawasaki disease; multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); SARS-CoV-2",,"32725955","Pediatr.

While it is being recommended to carry out only the emergent procedures and to postpone the non-urgent ones to a later date, this article is meant to provide an insight into triage of the ENT procedures and the various precautions to be taken into account by the ENT surgeons while carrying out a procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms ‘COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with ENT surgery. Results: Elective and non urgent cases are best avoided during this time. Only absolutely essential and emergent procedures need to be carried out with the use of Personal protective equipment comprising of safety gown, N95 mask, safety goggles, disposable gloves and caps. There is a possibility of transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 through asymptomatic patients and hence all patients, even with an unknown COVID-19 status, need to undergo a preoperative screening. As all procedures under general anesthesia are aerosol generating, the use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all the health care workers present in the operation theater. Conclusion: A proper knowledge of triage would be of immense help to the ENT surgeon in minimizing the exposure to health care workers and patients during this pandemic.

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations: This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance: Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.. © 2020 American Medical Association.

To understand factors that may contribute to viral spread and address long-term health sequelae for survivors, it is important to review evidence regarding viral presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and possible effects on fertility. Aim: To review the current literature regarding the sexual transmissibility of recent viral pandemics and their effects on semen parameters and fertility. We review evidence for the following viruses: Ebola, Zika, West Nile, pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and SARS-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance. References from identified articles were searched and included, if appropriate. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure of this study was reviewing of peer-reviewed literature. Results: Both the Ebola virus and Zika virus are present in semen, but only the Zika virus shows consistent evidence of sexual transmission. Current evidence does not support the presence of the West Nile virus, pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The Zika virus appears to alter semen parameters in a way that diminishes fertility, but the effect is likely time limited. The West Nile virus and SARS have been associated with orchitis in a small number of case reports. Viruses that cause febrile illness, such as pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, are associated with decreased sperm count and motility and abnormal morphology. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors present in the testes, which could impact spermatogenesis. Conclusions: We have reported the presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and fertility side effects of recent viral pandemics. Overall, semen studies and fertility effects are highly understudied in viral pandemics, and rigorous study on these topics should be undertaken as novel pandemics emerge.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also a disease of immune dysregulation leading to multisystem compromise. We present a case of new-onset SLE concomitantly with COVID-19 and development of antiphospholipid antibodies. An 18-year-old female that presented with hemodynamic collapse and respiratory failure, progressed to cardiac arrest, and had a pericardial tamponade drained. She then progressed to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, and worsening renal function with proteinuria and hematuria. Further studies showed bilateral pleural effusions, positive antinuclear and antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin B. C3 and C4 levels were low. SARS-Cov-2 PCR was positive after 2 negative tests. She also developed multiple deep venous thrombosis, in the setting of positive antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. In terms of pathophysiology, COVID-19 is believed to cause a dysregulated cytokine response which could potentially be exacerbated by the shift in Th1 to Th2 response seen in SLE. Also, it is well documented that viral infections are an environmental factor that contributes to the development of autoimmunity; however, COVID-19 is a new entity, and it is not known if it could trigger autoimmune conditions. Additionally, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2, as it happens with other viruses, might lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibodies, potentially contributing to the increased rates of thrombosis seen in COVID-19. © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).","Antiphospholipid syndrome; Autoimmunity; COVID-19; Cytokine release syndrome; Systemic lupus erythematosus",,"32720260","Clin.

Data Sources: We reviewed the relevant literature complied from available sources, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and otolaryngology journals providing electronic manuscripts ahead of indexing or publication. Review Methods: Incorporating available evidence and the projected infection control and resource limitations at our institution, we collectively authored a dynamic set of protocols guiding (1) case stratification, (2) preoperative assessment, (3) operative setup, and (4) postoperative care of patients with sinus or skull base presentations. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 publications, lack of rigorous data, and urgent necessity of standardized protocols, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were not employed. Conclusions: As scarce hospital resources are diverted to COVID-19 care and staff are redeployed to forward-facing roles, endonasal procedures have largely ceased, leaving patients with ongoing sinonasal and skull base complaints untreated. Skull base teams now weigh the urgency of surgery in this population with the regional availability of resources. Implications for Practice: The COVID-19 pandemic will have an enduring and unpredictable impact on hospital operations and surgical skull base practices and will require a dynamic set of management protocols responsive to new evidence and changing resources. In the current resource-limited environment, clinicians may utilize these protocols to assist with stratifying patients by acuity, performing preoperative assessment, and guiding peri- and postoperative care. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","coronavirus; COVID-19; endoscopy; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; sinus; skull base",,,"Otolaryngol.

The consequent inflammation is not able to clear viruses. The persistent excessive inflammatory response can build up a clinical picture that is very difficult to manage and potentially fatal. Modulating the immune response plays a key role in fighting the disease. One of the main defence systems is the activation of neutrophils that release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) under the stimulus of autophagy. Various molecules can induce NETosis and autophagy; some potent activators are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and, in particular, the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). This molecule is released by damaged lung cells and can induce a robust innate immunity response. The increase in HMGB1 and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, blocking these molecules might be useful in COVID-19 treatment and should be further studied in the context of targeted therapy. © 2020 Sebastiano Cicco et al.",,"anakinra; biological factor; chloroquine; cytokine receptor antagonist; damage associated molecular pattern; eculizumab; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; remdesivir; steroid; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; alarmin; high mobility group B1 protein; HMGB1 protein, human; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; drug targeting; extracellular trap; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; immunity; inflammation; lung disease; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; plasma; respiratory virus; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; steroid therapy; systematic review (topic); viral respiratory tract infection; virus; virus infection; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; extracellular trap; immunology; lung; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; Alarmins; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Extracellular Traps; HMGB1 Protein; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32724296","Mediators Inflamm.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088851846

So far, no specific antiviral therapeutic agent has been demonstrated to be effective for COVID-19; therefore, the clinical management is largely supportive and depends on the patients' immune response leading to a cytokine storm followed by lung edema, dysfunction of air exchange, and ARDS, which could lead to multiorgan failure and death. Given that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various tissue sources have revealed successful clinical outcomes in many immunocompromised disorders by inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the microenvironment, there is a growing demand for MSC infusions in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS in the ICU. In this review, we have documented the rationale and possible outcomes of compassionate use of MSCs, particularly in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, toward proving or disproving the efficacy of this approach in the near future. Many centers have registered and approved, and some already started, single-case or phase I/II trials primarily aiming to rescue their critical patients when no other therapeutic approach responds. On the other hand, it is also very important to mention that there is a good deal of concern about clinics offering unproven stem cell treatments for COVID-19.

For establishing some preliminary views on decontamination and disinfection, surrogate CoVs have commonly been assessed. This review serves to examine the existing science in regard to CoV containment generically and then to translate these findings into timely applications for COVID-19. There is widespread dissemination of CoVs in the immediate patient environment, and CoVs can potentially be spread via respiratory secretions, urine, and stool. Interpretations of the spread however must consider whether studies examine for viral RNA, virus viability by culture, or both. Presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and post-14 day virus excretion from patients may complicate the epidemiology. Whereas droplet spread is accepted, there continues to be controversy over the extent of possible airborne spread and especially now for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CoVs are stable in body secretions and sewage at reduced temperatures. In addition to temperature, dryness or relative humidity, initial viral burden, concomitant presence of bioburden, and the type of surface can all affect stability. Generalizing, CoVs can be susceptible to radiation, temperature extremes, pH extremes, peroxides, halogens, aldehydes, many solvents, and several alcohols. Whereas detergent surfactants can have some direct activity, these agents are better used as complements to a complex disinfectant solution. Disinfectants with multiple agents and adverse pH are more likely to be best active at higher water temperatures. Real-life assessments should be encouraged with working dilutions. The use of decontamination and disinfection should be balanced with considerations of patient and caregiver safety. Processes should also be balanced with considerations for other potential pathogens that must be targeted. Given some CoV differences and given that surrogate testing provides experimental correlates at best, direct assessments with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 are required. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronavirus; COVID-19; disinfection; prevention; transmission",,"32530505","J.

It is now one of the top-priority pathogens to be dealt with, because of high transmissibility, severe illness and associated mortality, wide geographical spread, lack of control measures with knowledge gaps in veterinary and human epidemiology, immunity and pathogenesis. The quick detection of cases and isolating them has become critical to contain it.

Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine. © 2020 Triggle et al.","COVID-19; Drugs; Vaccines","arbidol; azithromycin; baricitinib; BCG vaccine; beta interferon; celecoxib; chloroquine; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; paracetamol; remdesivir; ritonavir; tocilizumab; umifenovir; zanamivir; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug bioavailability; drug development; evidence based medicine; human; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Short Survey; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines","32404514","mSphere",Short Survey,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084626247

This disease has quickly developed into a global pandemic, resulting in over 350,000 deaths worldwide and over 5 million confirmed infections in a matter of 6 months. Although the genome of this novel viral RNA was sequenced quickly and testing kits were manufactured to assist in combatting COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment will remain relatively unsuccessful until the pathology of this disease is fully understood. Histotechnology plays an important role in understanding the pathology of many diseases, including COVID-19. The first postmortem biopsy of a COVID-19 patient was collected on 27 January 2020, and the pathology finding was published in mid-February 2020.

With the rapid adoption of these tests into clinical practice, combined with the widespread publicity they received, questions arose related to the different types of tests, their utility, performance, and regulatory approval status. The aim of this publication is to provide a general landscape of laboratory testing for COVID-19 and offer a historical and regulatory perspective associated with them. Specifically, we aim to elaborate on the regulatory complexities of diagnostic testing in the United States and its implications to the present outbreak, as well as provide a synopsis of laboratory tests that have been developed for COVID-19. We will first address the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 directly by either nucleic acid amplification tests or by the detection of the viral protein for active infections. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of serological tests that can aid not only in diagnosis but additionally help to identify prior infections and potential immunity. © 2020 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

Despite the wide availability of vaccines, there are multiple problems decreasing the effectiveness of vaccination programs. These include viral variability and hence the requirement to match strains by estimating which will become prevalent each season, problems associated with vaccine and adjuvant production, and the route of administration as well as the perceived lower vaccine efficiency in older adults. Clinical protection is still suboptimal for all of these reasons, and vaccine uptake remains too low in most countries. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines include developing universal vaccines independent of the circulating strains in any particular season and stimulating cellular as well as humoral responses, especially in the elderly. This commentary assesses progress over the last 3 years towards achieving these aims. Since the beginning of 2020, an unprecedented international academic and industrial effort to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has diverted attention away from influenza, but many of the lessons learned for the one will synergize with the other to mutual advantage. And, unlike the SARS-1 epidemic and, we hope, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, influenza will not be eliminated and thus efforts to improve influenza vaccines will remain of crucial importance. © 2020 Pawelec G and McElhaney J.","Adjuvant; Effectiveness; Elderly; Influenza; Vaccine","adjuvant; influenza vaccine; toll like receptor; influenza vaccine; cost effectiveness analysis; drug administration route; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug formulation; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; nonhuman; personalized medicine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccine production; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; influenza; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32399192","F1000 Res.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084627053

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care for several solid cancers and are associated with peculiar toxicities, including pneumonitis which has similar features to COVID-19 pneumonia. Areas covered: We summarize the main hallmarks of lung injury induced by ICIs and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and discuss the critical aspects for differential diagnosis and management. Symptoms and radiological findings are often similar; conversely, treatments are quite different. Furthermore, we focus on potential interactions generating hypotheses that need confirmatory studies. Expert opinion: All cancer patients treated with immunotherapy should receive screening for SARS-CoV-2. This would improve the diagnosis and management of pneumonia and guide therapeutic choices. Furthermore, clinicians could estimate the risk/benefit of continuing ICI treatment in COVID-19 positive patients. Temporary withdrawal of the immunotherapy treatment pending resolution of viral infection may be a reasonable option in long-responders patients. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coronavirus; COVID-19; immune checkpoint inhibitors; immune-related Pneumonitis; immunotherapy; pneumonia","immunological antineoplastic agent; cancer immunotherapy; coronavirus disease 2019; differential diagnosis; Editorial; human; immune related pneumonitis; immunopathology; lung injury; nonhuman; pneumonia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction","32588674","Expert Opin.

Among these, COVID-19 has greater transmission and mortality rate. 2019 nCoV belongs to a large family of positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. The most communal symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath during the incubation period (2-14 days) of infection. COVID-19 transmission is occurring from infected humans to close contact with one another through respiratory droplets, coughs, and sneezes of infected person. Moreover, the virus containing surfaces may also transmit the infection. Diagnosis is being carried out by collecting a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid diagnosing methods are also under development which can diagnose COVID 19 in few minutes to hours. Currently, there is no specific cure or preventive therapeutics available. Hence, based upon limited in-vitro and anecdotal data, Chloroquine, or Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Ritonavir are being employed in the management. Search for new specific anti-viral drugs from natural/synthetic origins is under full swing and many of them are currently used as chemotherapeutic drugs under clinical investigation. Yet, there is a strong need for development of vaccine, which may take several months to few years for the development. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

This began as an outbreak in December 2019, and till February 28, 2020, there have been 83,704 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, with 2,859 deaths, resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 3.41 per cent (95% confidence interval 3.29-3.54%). By this time (February 28, 2020) 58 countries or territories and one international conveyance (Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) were affected. As a part of the global response to manage and contain the pandemic, major emphasis was placed on generating research intelligence to guide evidence-based responses to contain the virus, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), owing to its genetic similarities with the SARS virus. This review summarizes the emerging evidence which can help guide the public health response, particularly in India. Key areas have been identified in which research needs to be conducted to generate critical intelligence for advising prevention and control efforts. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has once again exposed the weaknesses of global health systems preparedness, ability to respond to an infectious threat, the rapidity of transmission of infections across international borders and the ineffectiveness of kneejerk policy responses to emerging/re-emerging infectious disease threats. The review concludes with the key learning points from the ongoing efforts to prevent and contain COVID-19 and identifies the need to invest in health systems, community-led response mechanisms and the need for preparedness and global health security. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.","COVID-19-epidemic; MERS-CoV; novel coronavirus; pandemic; quarantine; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; transmission","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cobicistat; D dimer; darunavir; hydroxychloroquine; lactate dehydrogenase; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; umifenovir; virus vaccine; case fatality rate; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; disease control; disease surveillance; disease transmission; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; extracorporeal oxygenation; fatigue; fecal microbiota transplantation; fever; hand washing; human; hypertension; incubation time; India; indirect fluorescent antibody technique; lymphocytopenia; myalgia; pandemic; prophylaxis; prothrombin time; public health; quarantine; Review; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum analysis; travel; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; organization and management; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health","32362642","Indian J.

Since the disease does not currently have a particular treatment, there is a compelling need to find substitute means to dominate its expansion. In this rapid review, we aimed to determine some countries’ public responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: In this study, academic databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase, were investigated. The keywords applied in the search strategy besides the names of each country were: “Public Health,” “Public Response”, “Health Policy”, “COVID-19”, “Novel Coronavirus,” “2019-nCoV”, and “SARS-COV-2”. The countries included China, Italy, Iran, Spain, South Korea, Germany, France, United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Singapore. Results: The total number of retrieved articles in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase in April 2020 was 594, and after removing 259 duplicate articles, 335 papers were screened by the experts. After this investigation, 50 articles, in addition to 12 webpages, were extensively reviewed for the results section. Public health strategies and responses can be divided into four main areas, including monitoring, public education, crowd controlling, and care facilities. Conclusion: According to the results of the management decisions of some governments on quarantining, social isolation, screening methods, and flight suspensions due to the severity and anonymity of COVID-19, it is highly assured that these strategies would be the most successful approaches to confront the present pandemic. Governments should put in place timely and strict measures to halt the spread and diminish its unintended deadly consequences. © 2020, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

Search terms were queried as related to topics of antiviral agents and intranasal applications. A series of video conferences was convened among experts in otolaryngology, infectious diseases, public health, pharmacology, and virology to review the literature and discuss relevant findings. Conclusions: Intranasal drug delivery for antiviral agents has been studied for many years. Several agents have broad-spectrum antiviral activity, but they still require human safety and efficacy trials prior to implementation. Intranasal drug delivery has potential relevance for future clinical trials in the settings of disease spread prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral diseases.

Here we present key position statements including observations about the pathophysiology of (ARF). In terms of the pathophysiology of pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 can be divided into 3 phases. Pulmonary damage in advanced COVID-19 often differs from the known changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two types (type L and type H) are differentiated, corresponding to early- and late-stage lung damage. This differentiation should be taken into consideration in the respiratory support of ARF. The assessment of the extent of ARF should be based on arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions, and it needs to include the calculation of oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, hemoglobin level, the corrected values of Hüfner's factor, and cardiac output). Aerosols can cause transmission of infectious, virus-laden particles. Open systems or vented systems can increase the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened and endotracheal intubation carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should have top priority because fear of contagion should not be a primary reason for intubation. Based on the current knowledge, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow therapy (NHF), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be performed without an increased risk of infection to staff if PPE is provided. A significant proportion of patients with ARF present with relevant hypoxemia, which often cannot be fully corrected, even with a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) under NHF. In this situation, the oxygen therapy can be escalated to CPAP or NIV when the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not met. In ARF, NIV should be carried out in an intensive care unit or a comparable setting by experienced staff. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring and readiness for intubation are to be ensured at all times.

The viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus or COVID-19 (CoV-19) is known as a pandemic. After SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)–related CoV, COVID-19 is the third most pathogenic virus, hazardous to humans which have raised worries concerning the capacity of current security measures and the human services framework to deal with such danger. Recent Findings: According to WHO, the mortality rate of COVID-19 exceeded that of SARS and MERS in view of which COVID-19 was declared as public health emergency of international concern. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with single stranded RNA and non-segmented envelopes. Recently, genome sequencing confirmed that COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus, but the major source of this pandemic outbreak, its transmission, and mechanisms related to its pathogenicity to humans are not yet known. Summary: In order to prevent the further pandemic and loss to humanity, scientists are studying the development of therapeutic drugs, vaccines, and strategies to cure the infections. In this review, we present a brief introduction to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, i.e., coronavirus in humans and animals, its taxonomic classification, genome organization, its replication, pathogenicity, impact on socioeconomic growth, and drugs associated with COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Coronavirus; MERS-CoV; RNA genomes; SARS-CoV",,,"Curr.

The human viral challenge model studies can shorten the time to assess the efficacy of a new vaccine or treatment by combining this with the assessment of safety. The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, and an urgent race is on to develop a new vaccine against this virus in a timeframe never attempted before. The use of the human viral challenge model has been proposed to accelerate the development of the vaccine. In the early 2000s, the authors successfully developed a pathogenic human viral challenge model for another virus for which there was no effective treatment and established it to evaluate potential therapies and vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus.

With the rapid spread of this virus, an immense burden has fallen upon both healthcare and economic systems. As a consequence, there is an unprecedented urgency for researchers and scientific committees from all over the world to find an effective treatment and vaccine. Review Structure: Many potential therapies are currently under investigation, with some, like Hydroxychloroquine, being authorized for emergency use in some countries. The crucial issue is now clearly to find the suitable treatment strategy for patients given comorbidities and the timeline of the illness. Vaccines are also under development and phase 1 clinical trials are rolling. Despite all efforts, no single drug or vaccine has yet been approved. In this review, we aim at presenting the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide clinicians with a brief and solid overview of the current potential treatments classified according to their use at the three different currently proposed disease stages. In light of pathogenesis and proposed clinical classification, this review's purpose is to summarize and simplify the most important updates on the management and the potential treatment of this emergent disease. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Pathophysiology; Treatment",,,"Curr.

False negative cases are increasingly reported in several studies using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). For example, the positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swabs was reported to be about 60% in early stage of COVID-19. AIM: We aimed to present metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) as a potential tool to detect pathogens. METHODS: In the recent year, mNGS is shown the potential to detect pathogens without the need of hypothesis guided approach and is proven to be highly effective. RESULTS: A recent prospective study in the United States compared the diagnostic performance of routine diagnostic tests with mNGS and showed that mNGS detected a bacteria or virus in the CSF of 13 of 58 patients presenting with meningoencephalitis who were negative for or not assessed with routine diagnostic test including PCR. NGS also has the advantage to cover entire viral genomes. CONCLUSION: As viral metagenomics has significantly improved in recent years and become more cost effective, we think that a change in the approach toward a shot-gun metagenomic testing should be explored and could potentially aid the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and the management of this pandemic. © 2020 Davide Borroni, Kunal Gadhvi.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Metagenomics","cerebrospinal fluid; coronavirus disease 2019; Editorial; high throughput sequencing; human; isolation; meningoencephalitis; metagenomics; nonhuman; pandemic; prevention and control; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus detection; virus transmission",,"Open Access Maced.

The initial surge of patients with COVID-19 that have flooded hospitals has put a strain on physical space, workforce, and supplies. In addition, social distancing and the risk of COVID-19 transmission has created significant barriers for thoracic surgeons to diagnose and treat patients. Many hospitals across the country have temporarily suspended elective operations to preserve hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Currently, the pandemic has greatly disrupted the current standard of resection after adequate staging with imaging and/or surgical staging for early stage NSCLC well beyond the initial acute phase; therefore, a new paradigm for effective management will need to be devised until the COVID-19 pandemic is eradicated with systematic vaccination and herd immunity. Thoracic surgeons will need to recalibrate their approach to ensure that patients receive timely and effective treatment for early stage NSCLC. The management of early stage NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic should be balanced with available hospital resources, risk of progression of disease, risk of transmission of COVID-19 to patient and surgeon, and the availability of alternative therapies. This article will address the current challenges with treating early stage NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a clinical framework for providing effective surgical therapy while mitigating the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to patients and surgeons. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Non–small-cell lung cancer; Protection; Surgery; Testing",,,"Clin.

Coronaviruses are positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses that infect several animal species, causing symptoms that range from those similar to the common cold to severe respiratory syndrome. The Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV2 functional receptor. Measures are currently undertaken worldwide to control the infection to avoid disruption of the social and economic equilibrium, especially in countries with poor healthcare resources. In a guarded optimistic view, we hope that the undertaken preventive and treatment measures will at least contribute to contain viral diffusion, attenuate activity, or even eliminate SARS-CoV2. In this review, we discuss emerging perspectives for prevention/treatment of COVID-19 infection. In addition to vaccines under development, passive immunization is an open opportunity since patients develop neutralizing antibodies. A full spectrum of potential drugs for COVID-19 infections could in turn affect virus binding or enzymatic activities involved in viral replication and transcription. Furthermore, clinical trials are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as tocilizumab. Bioinformatics may allow characterization of specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses; thus, CoV2 T cells’ frequency can be correlated with the disease severity and outcome. Combinatorial antibody phage display may be empowered to identify the immune repertoire of CoV2-specific neutralizing antibodies. © 2020 by the authors.

SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. We describe here the positivity for COVID-19 among SARI patients and their characteristics. Methods: SARI patients admitted at 41 sentinel sites from February 15, 2020 onwards were tested for COVID-19 by real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, targeting E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network for analysis. Results: A total of 104 (1.8%) of the 5,911 SARI patients tested were positive for COVID-19. These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 States/Union Territories. The COVID-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years. In all, 40 (39.2%) COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel. Interpretation & conclusions: COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting COVID-19 cases among SARI patients. Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research.","Containment; COVID-19; SARI; sentinel; surveillance","RNA directed RNA polymerase; adult; coronavirus disease 2019; disease surveillance; E gene; female; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nose smear; quarantine; RdRp gene; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus gene; adolescent; aged; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; India; infant; middle aged; newborn; pandemic; preschool child; sentinel surveillance; severe acute respiratory syndrome; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sentinel Surveillance; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Young Adult","32362647","Indian J.

Method: A literature review was conducted using Google Scholar® and MEDLINE®/PubMed® to identify current available evidence regarding the sensitivity of CT chest compared with RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19-positive patients. GRADE criteria and the QUADAS 2 tool were used to assess the level of evidence. Results: A total of 20 articles were identified that addressed the question of sensitivity of CT for diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. Overall sensitivity of CT scan ranged from 57%–100% for symptomatic and 46%–100% for asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, while that of RT-PCR ranged from 39%–89%. CT chest was a better diagnostic modality and capable of detecting active infection earlier in the time course of infection than RT-PCR in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, disease prevalence seems to play a role in the positive predictive value. Minimal evidence exists regarding the sensitivity of CT in patients who are asymptomatic. Conclusions: In surgical patients, CT chest should be considered as an important adjunct for detection of COVID-19 infection in patients who are symptomatic with negative RT-PCR prior to any operation. For surgical patients who are asymptomatic, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine preoperative CT chest for COVID-19 screening.

Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl.

Frequent touching of contaminated surfaces in public areas is therefore a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The inanimate surfaces have often been described as a source of nosocomial infections. However, summaries on the transmissibility of coronaviruses from contaminated surfaces to induce the coronavirus disease 2019 are rare at present. This review aims to summarize data on the persistence of different coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces. The literature was systematically searched on Medline without language restrictions. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration persistence of coronaviruses on any type of surface were included. Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as coronaviruses, influenza, SARS-CoV, or rhinovirus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Persistence time on inanimate surfaces varied from minutes to up to one month, depending on the environmental conditions. SARSCoV-2 can be sustained in air in closed unventilated buses for at least 30 min without losing infectivity. The most common coronaviruses may well survive or persist on surfaces for up to one month. Viruses in respiratory or fecal specimens can maintain infectivity for quite a long time at room temperature. Absorbent materials like cotton are safer than unabsorbent materials for protection from virus infection. The risk of transmission via touching contaminated paper is low. Preventive strategies such as washing hands and wearing masks are critical to the control of coronavirus disease 2019. ©The Author(s) 2020.","Coronavirus disease 2019; Inanimate surface; Infectivity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Survival; Transmission","aerosol; ambulatory care; avian influenza virus; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; endotracheal intubation; epidemic; feces analysis; hand washing; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human respiratory syncytial virus; humidity; infection risk; Influenza A virus; intensive care unit; nonhuman; persistent virus infection; pneumonia; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rhinovirus; SARS coronavirus; sequential analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; Short Survey; sputum culture; transmission electron microscopy; upper respiratory tract infection; Vero C1008 cell line; virus infectivity; virus shedding; virus survival; virus transmission",,"World J.

Thus, an LU approach to patients with suspected COVID-19 is being implemented worldwide. In noncritical COVID-19 patients, 2 new LU signs have been described and proposed, the “waterfall” and the “light beam” signs. Both signs have been hypothesized to increase the diagnostic accuracy of LU for COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. In critically ill patients, a distinct pattern of LU changes seems to follow the disease's progression, and this information can be used to guide decisions about when a patient needs to be ventilated, as occurs in other disease states similar to COVID-19. Furthermore, a new algorithm has been published, which enables the automatic detection of B-lines as well as quantification of the percentage of the pleural line associated with lung disease. In COVID-19 patients, a direct involvement of cardiac function has been demonstrated, and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction might be present due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation often involved, as reported for similar diseases. For this reason, cardiac and diaphragm ultrasound evaluation are highly important. Last but not least, due to the thrombotic tendency of COVID-19 patients, particular attention also should be paid to vascular ultrasound. This review is primarily devoted to the study of LU in COVID-19 patients. The authors explain the significance of its “light and shadows,” bearing in mind the context in which LU is being used—the emergency department and the intensive care setting.

The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is not limited to the respiratory system but has widespread involvement including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver, with evidence of prolonged fecal shedding and feco-oral transmission. This finding has stirred up a hornet’s nest of not only a newer modality of the spread of the virus but also a risk of the unpredictable duration of the infective potential of the shedders. We reviewed the literature on fecal shedding and possible implications on prevention and surveillance strategies. The pandemic is changing the management of underlying chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other diseases. Moreover, for the gastroenterologist, doing endoscopic procedures in this COVID-19 era poses a high risk of contamination, as it is an aerosol-generating procedure. There is a daily influx of data on this disease, and multiple societies are coming up with various recommendations. We provide a comprehensive review of all the reported GI manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the side effects of confounding drugs. We have summarized the management recommendations for diseases such as IBD with COVID-19 and nutritional recommendations and provided a concise review of the endoscopy guidelines by the various societies.

This article is a consensus statement provided by the Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology and the Canadian Association of Radiologists outlining the role of imaging in COVID-19 patients. The objectives are to answer key questions related to COVID-19 imaging of the chest and provide guidance for radiologists who are interpreting such studies during this pandemic. The role of chest radiography (CXR), computed tomography (CT), and lung ultrasound is discussed. This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as “When is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?” or “How should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?” This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided. Proposed reporting language is also outlined based on this structure.

Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1–3]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples. Methods: | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's ⟪pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) ⟫, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1]. The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests. Results: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times). Discussion|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,"32311437","Travel Med.

We aim to review the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancer, with an emphasis on the role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) during a pandemic. Data Sources: COVID-19 resources from PubMed, Google Scholar, the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Head and Neck Society were examined. Review Methods: Studies and guidelines related to the multidisciplinary management of head and neck cancer in the COVID-19 setting were reviewed. A total of 54 studies were included. Given the continuously evolving body of literature, the sources cited include the latest statements from medical and dental societies. Results: The unpredictable fluctuation of hospital resources and the risk of the nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 have direct effects on head and neck cancer management. Using an MDT approach to help define “essential surgery” for immediately life- or function-threatening disease processes in the context of available hospital resources will help to maximize outcomes. Early enrollment in an MDT is often critical for considering nonsurgical options to protect patients and health care workers. The role of the MDT continues after cancer treatment, if delivered, and the MDT plays an essential role in surveillance and survivorship programs in these challenging times. Conclusion: Head and neck cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge for all specialists involved. Early MDT involvement is important to maximize patient outcomes and satisfaction in the context of public and community safety. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","cancer management; COVID-19; head and neck cancer; multidisciplinary cancer; survivorship",,"32484380","Otolaryngol.

This paper summarizes current evidence-base around the transmission dynamics, pathogenic, and clinical features of COVID-19, to critically identify if there are any gaps in the current IPC guidelines.MethodsThis study involved a review of global COVID-19 IPC guidelines such as WHO, the CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from two high income countries (Australia and UK) and one middle income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on 'Pubmed' and Google Scholars. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations and exposures that may facilitate the transmission and compared and contrasted these findings with the recommended IPC measures.ResultsThe review findings showed nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health settings through droplet, aerosol and by an oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol generating procedures. However, recommendations around type of surgical masks varied. In addition, CDC recommends cloth masks when the surgical mask is totally unavailable.ConclusionIPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and target all patient care activities where there may be person to person transmission risk.

In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods - Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results - A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. Conclusions - We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management.

At first, the disease spread locally affecting the people of Wuhan, and then started spreading throughout China, creating a worldwide panic. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from China and local healthcare units organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The causative organism of this infection is a new virus that belongs to the “coronavirus (CoV)” family. After which the disease was called nCoV-19 (Novel coronavirus – 19).

The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and is currently still ongoing. This novel coronavirus is highly contagious and has resulted in a continuously increasing number of infections and deaths that have already surpassed the SARS-CoV outbreak that occurred in China between 2002 and 2003. It is now officially a pandemic, announced by WHO on the 11th of March. Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial. Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency. Key Points • In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. • Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. • Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronavirus; Diagnostic imaging; Mass chest X-ray; Multidetector computed tomography; Pneumonia",,"32296940","Eur.

The causative agent of this infection is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The data available on one of the promising therapeutic agents—nucleotide analog remdesivir (Gilead Sciences number GS5734)—were evaluated. These data were concerned with remdesivir activation from the prodrug to the active molecule—triphosphate containing 1′-cyano group and modified nucleobase. This triphosphate competes with the natural substrate adenosine triphosphate. Additionally, its mechanisms of action based on RNA and proofreading exonuclease inhibition, leading to the delayed RNA chain termination of infected cells, and basic pharmacological data were assessed. Additionally, the analytical determination of remdesivir and its metabolites in cells and body liquids and also some data from remdesivir use in other RNA infections—such as Ebola, Nipah virus infection, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—were summarized. More recent and more detailed data on the clinical use of remdesivir in COVID-19 were reported, showing the intensive efforts of clinicians and scientists to develop a cure for this new disease. Remdesivir as such represents one of the more promising alternatives for COVID-19 therapy, however the current understanding of this disease and the possible ways of dealing with it requires further investigation. © 2020 by the authors.

Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,"32446866","Ocul.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76% to 78% and 73% to 76% for the whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as the drug and/or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at a higher risk from the COVID-19. A number of potential drugs/vaccines as well as antibody/cytokine-based therapeutics are in various developmental stages of preclinical/clinical trials against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV with substantial cross-reactivity, and may be used against COVID-19. For diagnosis, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. A kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but this is challenging due to the antibodies cross-reactivity.

Accurate and early detection of infectious pathogens are crucial for transmission control, clinical diagnosis and therapy. For a traditional reason, most immunological and microbiological laboratories are equipped with instruments designated for antibody-based assays in detection of infectious pathogens or clinical diagnosis. Emerging aptamer-based technologies have pushed a shift from antibody-based to aptamer-based assays due to equal specificity, even better sensitivity, lower manufacturing cost and more flexibility in amending for chemiluminescent, electrochemical or fluorescent detection in a multifaceted and high throughput fashion in comparison of aptamer-based to antibody-based assays. The nature of aptamer-based technologies is particularly suitable for point-of-care testing in remote areas at warm or hot atmosphere, and mass screening for potential infection in pandemic of emerging infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in an epicenter or other regions. This review intends to summarize currently available aptamer-based technologies in detection of bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens for research and clinical application. It is anticipated that potential technologies will be further optimized and validated for clinical translation in meeting increasing demands for prompt, precise and reliable detection of specific pathogens in various atmospheric conditions. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This novel community health trouble is frightening the universe with clinical, psychological, emotional, collapse of health system and economical slowdown in each and every part of the world infecting nearly 200 countries. A highly virulent and pathogenic COVID-19 viral infection with incubation period ranging from two to fourteen days, transmitted by breathing of infected droplets or contact with infected droplets, belongs to the genus Coronavirus with its high mutation rate in the Coronaviridae. The likely probable primary reservoir could be bats, because genomic analysis discovered that SARSCoV-2 is phylogenetically interrelated to SARS-like bat viruses. The transitional resource of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapidly developing pandemic has cone firmed human to human transfer. Approximately 1,016,128 reported cases, 211,615 recovered cases and 53,069 deaths of COVID-2019 have been reported to date (April 2, 2020). The symptoms vary from asymptomatic, low grade pyrexia, dry cough, sore throat, breathlessness, tiredness, body aches, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, to severe consolidation and pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction leading to death with case fatality rate ranging from 2 to 3%. The most common diagnostic methods are molecular methods as RT-PCR (reverse transcription) or real-time PCR, which are prepared by means of RNA from respiratory samples such as oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, deep tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment is essentially supportive; as there is no documented clinically established and accepted antiviral remedy or vaccine existing, but some wide-ranging antiviral, anti-malarial and anti-parasitic drugs have been evaluated to be used in COVID-19. Prevention includes home segregation and quarantine of suspected cases or those with mild illnesses and stringent infection control measures should be taken at hospitals to contain contact and droplet infections. International health authorities are focusing on rapid diagnosis of cases, tracing of contacts, isolation of patients and searching for antiviral therapies to counter the deadliest COVID-19 disease. © Copyright: the Author(s), 2020","ARDS; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Infection; Multiorgan failure; Outbreak; Pathogenesis; Pneumonia","antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; beta interferon; chloroquine; inactivated virus vaccine; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; nucleic acid; antivirus agent; acute kidney failure; antigen antibody complex; antigen presentation; antiviral therapy; cellular immunity; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; heart arrest; heart injury; heart muscle ischemia; hemophagocytic syndrome; human; humoral immunity; immune evasion; infection prevention; laboratory test; medical history; nonhuman; Review; secondary infection; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus detection; virus entry; virus pathogenesis; virus replication; virus transmission; World Health Organization; animal; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug development; epidemic; global health; isolation and purification; pandemic; procedures; public health; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Drug Development; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","32425013","Monaldi Arch.

First, in Wuhan, China, the novel SARS-CoV2 was named by the World Health Organization (WHO), as 2019-nCOV (COVID-19), and spread extremely all over the world. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted to individuals by human-to-human transmission leading to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory system injury. SARS-CoV2 elicits infections from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other organ destruction. There is a possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic cases as active carriers, in addition to symptomatic ones, which is a crucial crisis of COVID-19 that should be considered. Hence, paying more attention to the accurate and immediate diagnosis of suspected and infected cases can be a great help in preventing the rapid spread of the virus, improving the disease prognosis, and controlling the pandemic. In this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the different types of Clinical and Para-clinical diagnostic methods and their practical features, which can help understand better the applications and capacities of various diagnostic approaches for COVID-19 infected cases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","COVID-19; diagnosis; molecular assays; radiological findings; serological assays",,"32452050","J.

Importantly, all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage. However, the concentration of viral RNA in the anal swab (Ct value = 24 + 39) was higher than in the blood (Ct value = 34 + 39) from patient 2, suggesting that the virus might replicate in the digestive tract.

The great majority of fatal events have been recorded in adults older than 70 years; of them, a large proportion had comorbidities. Since data regarding the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in neonates and children developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce and originate mainly from one country (China), we reviewed all the current literature from 1 December 2019 to 7 May 2020 to provide useful information about SARS-CoV2 viral biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, treatment, prevention, and hospital organization for clinicians dealing with this selected population. Impact: Children usually develop a mild form of COVID-19, rarely requiring high-intensity medical treatment in pediatric intensive care unit.Vertical transmission is unlikely, but not completely excluded.Children with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 must be isolated and healthcare workers should wear appropriate protective equipment.Some clinical features (higher incidence of fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and a longer incubation period) are more common in children than in adults, as well as some radiologic aspects (more patchy shadow opacities on CT scan images than ground-glass opacities).Supportive and symptomatic treatments (oxygen therapy and antibiotics for preventing/treating bacterial coinfections) are recommended in these patients. © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,,,"Pediatr.

In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease. We propose a transfer learning model to quicken the prediction process and assist the medical professionals. The proposed model outperforms the other existing models. This makes the time-consuming process easier and faster for radiologists and this reduces the spread of virus and save lives. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chest X-Ray; Computed tomography; COVID-19; Haralick feature; Transfer learning; Viral pneumonia","Acoustic impedance; Computerized tomography; Disease control; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Textures; Viruses; Area of interest; Haralick features; Learning techniques; Medical professionals; Prediction process; Spread of disease; Spread of virus; Texture feature extraction; Transfer learning",,"Appl Intell",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089356353

In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process.

Based on the recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC. One of the purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries. On February 3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which includes accelerating research and development (R&D) processes as one of three major strategies.

The fact that a COVID-19 R&D forum was the first meeting convened after the PHEIC declaration testifies to the importance of R&D in response to EID. Korea has demonstrated a remarkable capacity in its laboratory response by conducting high-throughput COVID-19 testing and utilizing innovative drive-through samplings. These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. It is expected that Korea plays a global partner for COVID-19 research by actively participating in immediate and mid/long-term priorities jointly led by WHO and global partners.","COVID-19; Emergency Committee; International Health Regulations; Public Health Emergency of International Concern; Research and development","Betacoronavirus; civil defense; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; global health; human; pandemic; public health; public health service; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Civil Defense; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Global Health; Humans; International Health Regulations; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Public Health Practice; World Health Organization","32192278","Epidemiol Health",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083041256

It is challenging for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other acute respiratory tract infections via clinical symptoms because those who are infected display a wide range of symptoms. An effective, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tool could mitigate healthcare system strain, protect healthcare professionals, and support quarantine efforts. We believe that a POC tool can be developed that would be rapid, easy to use, and inexpensive. It could be used in the home, in resource-limited areas, and even in clinical settings. In this article, we summarize the current state of POC tools and propose an all-in-one, highly sensitive POC assay that integrates antibody detection, protein detection, and serum cytokine detection to diagnose COVID-19 infection. We believe this article will provide insight into the current state of POC diagnostics for COVID-19, and promote additional research and tool development that could be exceptionally impactful. © 2020 The Authors.

The immediate actions from both academia and industry have led to the development of many COVID-19 diagnostic systems that have secured fast-track regulatory approvals and have been serving our healthcare frontlines since the early stage of the pandemic. On diagnostic technologies, many of these clinically validated systems have significantly benefited from the recent advances in micro- and nanotechnologies in terms of platform design, analytical method, and system integration and miniaturization. The continued development of new diagnostic platforms integrating micro- and nanocomponents will address some of the shortcomings we have witnessed in the existing COVID-19 diagnostic systems. This Perspective reviews the previous and ongoing research efforts on developing integrated micro- and nanosystems for nucleic acid-based virus detection, and highlights promising technologies that could provide better solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other viral infectious diseases. With the summary and outlook of this rapidly evolving research field, we hope to inspire more research and development activities to better prepare our society for future public health crises. The development of integrated molecular diagnostic platforms based on state-of-the-art micro- and nanotechnologies has greatly improved both laboratory-based and point-of-care testing of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Enabled by recent advances in molecular biology, analytical chemistry, microfluidics, nanotechnology, and biomedical instrumentation, these integrated micro- and nanosystems hold significant potential to provide better solutions for diagnosis of COVID-19 and other viral infectious diseases in epidemic and pandemic situations. By summarizing the state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic systems and highlighting the promising technologies that need further development, this Perspective intends to spark further research and development activities in this critical research area. Integrated molecular diagnostic systems for viral infection testing have greatly facilitated our ongoing combat with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This Perspective summarizes the recent advances in developing integrated micro- and nanosystems for nucleic acid-based testing of viral infectious diseases and highlights the future trends with the hope of inspiring more research and development activities. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"Chemical analysis; Diagnosis; Diseases; Molecular biology; Nucleic acids; Public health; Viruses; Biomedical instrumentation; Critical researches; Diagnostic technologies; Infectious disease; Molecular diagnostics; Point-of-care testing; Regulatory approvals; Research and development; Nanosystems",,"Matter",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088389783

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the most commonly used method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 worldwide. The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine and Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control regularly update the guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis. Emergency use authorization for some laboratory diagnostic kits has been granted, enabling the timely diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, and the isolation of infected patients. Due to the collective efforts of the government, medical professionals, local authorities, and the public, Korea’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been accepted widely as a model. Here, we summarize the currently available laboratory tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. Although RT-PCR tests are used widely to confirm COVID-19, antibody tests could provide information about immune responses to the virus. © 2020 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Serology","antidepressant agent; dopamine 1 receptor; fluoxetine; serotonin; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; dentate gyrus; human; laboratory technique; pandemic; South Korea; virus pneumonia; Antidepressive Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dentate Gyrus; Fluoxetine; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Dopamine D1; Republic of Korea; Serotonin","32668512","Korean J.

However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively.

Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world. However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands. A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth. This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years. Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework. The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system's response to the current crisis. The article discusses telehealth's contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and the recent initiatives triggered in Brazil as opportunities for the consolidation of telemedicine and improvement of the Brazilian Unified National Health System. The authors conclude that telehealth offers capabilities for remote screening, care and treatment, and assists monitoring, surveillance, detection, prevention, and mitigation of the impacts on healthcare indirectly related to COVID-19.

Teaching/university hospitals should pull their resources and man-power to provide the muchneeded assistance to the demand of Covid-19 testing. Inadequate testing could result in unrecognised Covid-19 infected individuals, roaming freely in the population. The other issue is the sensitivity of test if samples were obtained from different sites. Classically, the confirmation of diagnosis of Covid-19 depends on real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to detect viral genetic material in either a nasal swab or bronchioalveolar lavage sample. Wang et al. (2020) reported that bronchioalveolar lavage sample has the highest sensitivity in identifying Covid-19, followed by sputum and nasal swab with positive rates of 93%, 72% and 63%, respectively.3 Furthermore, they found that nasal swab contained the highest concentration of viral load as it required less number of cycles to achieve higher copy numbers. In some patients, viral genetic material was also identified in faeces and blood.3 While the reliability of testing is a concern, the safety of the laboratory staff also has to be kept in mind. In this issue, there are three review articles on Covid-19, first article described the general properties of coronavirus, second article described the diagnostic performance of Covid-19 serology assay and third article described the importance of the site of sampling for Covid-19.4-6. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required. The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies. Key findings: Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting. However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus. Implications for practice: The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce. © 2020","COVID-19; Intensive care; ITU; Lung ultrasound; POCUS; Point of care ultrasound",,,"Radiography",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083459177

We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Otorrinolaringología y Cirugía de Cabeza y Cuello","Anosmia; COVID 19; Post-viral olfactory dysfunction",,,"Acta Otorrinolaringol.

In response, the U.S. Surgeon General, the American College of Srugeons, and other surgical professional societies recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges have particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand. The purpose of this white paper is to highlight all phases of gynecologic cancer surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate when it is best to operate, to hestitate, and reintegrate surgery. Triage and prioritization of surgical cases, preoperative COVID-19 testing, peri-operative safety principles, and preparations for the post-COVID-19 peak and surgical reintegration are reviewed. © 2020",,,"32532460","Gynecol.

This work surveys the landscape of available and emerging biosensor technologies for COVID-19 testing. Molecular diagnostic assays based on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are used in most clinical laboratories. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed testing capacity and motivated the development of fast point-of-care tests and the adoption of isothermal DNA amplification. Antigenic and serological rapid tests based on lateral-flow immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity. Advanced digital systems enhance performance at the expense of speed and the need for large equipment. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR gene-editing tools, benefit from high sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostics and the easy use of lateral-flow assays. DNA sequencing and sample pooling strategies are highlighted to bring out the full capacity of the available biosensor technologies and accelerate mass testing. © 2020 The Authors.

All medical specialties including gastroenterology are impacted by COVID-19. Here, we review the bidirectional comorbidity of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and COVID-19, including the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in individuals with various GI disorders and the impact of COVID-19 on the course and outcome of the underlying (or comorbid) GI disorders. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is more (or less) frequent in comorbid GI disorders. It is also reassuring that the outcome of COVID-19 is unaffected by the underlying GI disorder or its treatment, though potential concerns remain in regard to the use of immunomodulatory treatments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplant recipients. Despite these concerns, there is now agreement among experts that ongoing immunomodulatory treatments may not be interrupted in individuals with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution, however, may be exercised with the use of corticosteroids in the management of IBD. In addition, COVID-19 does not appear to impact the manifestations, course, outcome, and treatment of comorbid GI disorders, e.g. IBD. Decompensation of liver cirrhosis is, however, possible during COVID-19 episodes. A direct concern, however, might relate to the potential transmission of the virus through fecal microbiota transplants. © 2020, Indian Society of Gastroenterology.","Comorbidity; Corona Virus; COVID-19; Crohn disease; Diarrhea; Immunosupression; Inflammatory bowel disease; Pandemic; Ulcerative colitis",,,"Indian J.

During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem. The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus. The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast. Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy. In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care. Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection.

Studies are increasing to find the best therapeutic approach for the disease and its management. Regenerative medicine offers various cell-tissue therapeutics and related products, such as stem cell therapy, natural killer (NK) cell therapy, Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, exosomes, and tissue products. Interestingly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce inflammatory symptoms and protect against cytokine storm, which critically contributes to the COVID-19 progression. Notably, having the potentials to exert cytotoxic effects on infected cells and induce interferon production probably make NK cells a candidate for COVID-19 cell therapy. Besides, exosomes are one of the crucial products of cells that can exert therapeutic effects through the induction of immune responses and neutralizing antibody titers. The paper aims to briefly consider current options for COVID-19 therapy to show that there is no specific cure for COVID-19, and then assess the real opportunities and range of promises regenerative medicine can provide for specific treatment of COVID-19.

However, DNN classifiers trained on known diseases usually fail when they confront new diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework and pipeline for explainable medical imaging that can classify known diseases as well as detect new/unknown diseases when the models are only trained on known disease images. We first provide in-depth mathematical analysis to explain the overconfidence phenomena and present the calibrated confidence that can mitigate the overconfidence. Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors’ ground truth. While our work was not designed to target COVID-19, our experimental validation using the real world COVID-19 cases/data demonstrates the general applicability of our pipeline for different diseases based on medical imaging. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","COVID-19; DNN confidence calibration; New/unknown disease discovery; Visual explanation","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image analysis; Image understanding; Medical imaging; Pipelines; Chest x-rays; Decision engines; Experimental validations; Ground truth; Large amounts; Learning frameworks; Mathematical analysis; Skin lesion; Diagnosis",,"Commun.

Aims: To assess the prevalence of CLD, the incidence of elevated liver chemistries and the outcomes of patients with and without underlying CLD/elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases from 1 December 2019 to 24 April 2020 was done. We included studies reporting underlying CLD or elevated liver chemistries and patient outcomes in COVID-19. Results: 107 articles (n = 20 874 patients) were included for the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of underlying CLD was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5-5.1) among the 15 407 COVID-19 patients. The pooled incidence of elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19 was 23.1% (19.3-27.3) at initial presentation. Additionally, 24.4% (13.5-40) developed elevated liver chemistries during the illness. The pooled incidence of drug-induced liver injury was 25.4% (14.2-41.4). The pooled prevalence of CLD among 1587 severely infected patients was 3.9% (3%-5.2%). The odds of developing severe COVID-19 in CLD patients was 0.81 (0.31-2.09; P = 0.67) compared to non-CLD patients. COVID-19 patients with elevated liver chemistries had increased risk of mortality (OR-3.46 [2.42-4.95, P < 0.001]) and severe disease (OR-2.87 [95% CI, 2.29-3.6, P < 0.001]) compared to patients without elevated liver chemistries. Conclusions: Elevated liver chemistries are common at presentation and during COVID-19. The severity of elevated liver chemistries determines the outcome of COVID-19. The presence of CLD does not alter the outcome of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to analyse the outcomes of compensated and decompensated liver disease. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,"Aliment. Pharmacol.

Since this pandemic began, there have been numerous reports about the COVID-19 involvement of the nervous system. There have been reports of both direct and indirect involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system by the virus. Objective: To review the neuropsychiatric manifestations along with corresponding pathophysiologic mechanisms of nervous system involvement by the COVID-19. Background: Since the beginning of the disease in humans in the later part of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread across the world with over 2,719,000 reported cases in over 200 countries [World Health Organization. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report-96.,]. While patients typically present with fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, and cough, neurologic manifestations have been reported, as well. These include the ones with both direct and indirect involvement of the nervous system. The reported manifestations include anosmia, ageusia, central respiratory failure, stroke, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, toxic–metabolic encephalopathy, headache, myalgia, myelitis, ataxia, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations. These data were derived from the published clinical data in various journals and case reports. Conclusion: The neurological manifestations of the COVID-19 are varied and the data about this continue to evolve as the pandemic continues to progress. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Hyperinflammation; Neuropsychiatric; Pathophysiology; Stroke",,,"J.

Methods: We systematically researched in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases observational studies describing COVID-19 in children and/or adolescents until April 11, 2020. Data regarding clinical and radiological features were extracted from eligible studies and meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling. Results: We examined 19 eligible studies for a total of 2855 children and/or adolescents with COVID-19. Approximately 47% of subjects had fever (95% confidence interval [CI] 22−72%; I2 = 98.6%), 37% cough (95%CI 15−63%; I2 = 98.6%), 4% diarrhea (95%CI 0−12%; I2 = 92.2%), 2% nasal congestion (95%CI 0−7%; I2 = 87.7%), 1% dyspnea (95%CI 0−7%; I2 = 91.5%) and 0% abdominal pain (95%CI 0−1%; I2 = 76.3%). Subjects presented mild symptoms in 79% (95%CI 65−91%; I2 = 93.5%) of cases, whereas only 4% (95%CI 1−9%; I2 = 76.4%) were critical. Among those with pneumonia on computed tomography, 26.4% (95%CI 13−41%; I2 = 80.8%) presented a unilateral involvement, 16% (95%CI 5−29%, I2 = 81.2%) had bilateral involvement and 9% (95%CI 0−24%; I2 = 88.7%) had interstitial pneumonia. Conclusions: Children and/or adolescents tend to have a mild COVID-19 course with a good prognosis. Impact: Compared to adults, children and/or adolescents tend to have a mild COVID-19 course with a good prognosis.This study provides new and consistence information on the clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 in pediatrics.This study may help to fight COVID-19 in pediatric population. © 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,,,"Pediatr.

Patients with chronic underlying conditions may have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Kidney transplant recipients may be at a uniquely increased risk of serious complications from COVID-19 as compared to the general population because of a chronically immunosuppressed state and a high prevalence of comorbidities like diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease. Early data suggest that the mortality of patients on dialysis may be comparable to those with kidney transplants, although more research is needed. This concise review aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients, manifestations, appropriate management, and clinical outcomes based on the available literature. Current evidence on many of the specific antiviral measures against COVID-19 has not shown a clear-cut benefit in smaller studies and the results of several ongoing larger clinical trials are awaited.

The constellation of clinical, histological and laboratory findings seen in these patients is similar to other forms of viral pneumonia, but somewhat distinctive aspects exist which may raise the index of suspicion for this disease. The pathological findings are not limited to the respiratory system; cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal abnormalities have also been described. Establishing a link between the clinical features and macroscopic and microscopic findings is not only important for the practicing autopsy pathologist, but also for understanding of the disease as a whole. Furthermore, context-sensitive interpretation of diagnostic tests is essential.

Prevention and containment became the prioritized intervention against COVID-19, coupled with a continued search for hallmarks of the disease that would allow early detection and provide insight into management and triage. Cutaneous findings associated with COVID-19 include diffuse maculopapular rashes, livedo reticularis, and acro-ischemic “COVID toes.” These skin findings occurred anywhere from days before respiratory symptom onset to weeks after recovery, and predominantly in child and adolescent populations.

The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis will likely accelerate the implementation of automation and create unique problems involving human–automation trust for naïve users of automated technologies in the future. Method: We briefly review factors that can influence the development of human–automation trust amidst and following the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on two theories on human-automation trust and how naïve users develop and maintain their trust in unfamiliar technologies. Results: The current review identifies user workload and perceived risk as critical factors that will impact human–automation trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both theories predict that it is important for naïve users to accumulate and analyze behavioral evidence of automated technologies to maintain appropriate trust levels as the pandemic progresses. Conclusion and application: Theories of human–automation trust inform trajectories of trust development toward unfamiliar technologies for naïve users. In application, manufacturers and distributers should focus on communicating system information effectively to retain users who may be “forced” to use unfamiliar technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright 2020, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","COVID-19; human–automation trust; naïve automation users; trust development","Ergonomics; Human engineering; Automated technology; Critical factors; Perceived risk; System information; Trust level; Automation",,"Hum.

Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques. Secondly, the development of the MCDA approach for benchmarking AI classification techniques is provided on the basis of the integrated analytic hierarchy process and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods. Lastly, objective and subjective validation procedures are described to validate the proposed benchmarking solutions. © 2020 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; COVID-19; Decision-making; Evaluation; MCDA; Medical image",,,"J.

As cardiovascular patients are at high risk but also have dyspnea and fatigue as leading symptoms, prevention, diagnostics and treatment in these patients are important to provide adequate care for those with or without COVID-19 but most importantly when comorbid cardiovascular conditions are present. Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes. As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified. As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn. As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiovascular risk; CORONA; COVID-19; Heart failure; Hypertension; Myocardial injury",,,"Clin.

Although the rate of new infections in China has decreased, currently, 169 countries report confirmed cases, with many nations showing increasing numbers daily. Testing for COVID-19 infection is performed via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, but availability is limited in many parts of the world. The role of chest computed tomography is yet to be determined and may vary depending on the local prevalence of disease and availability of laboratory testing. A common but nonspecific pattern of disease with a somewhat predictable progression is seen in patients with COVID-19. Specifically, patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of the lower lungs may be present initially, eventually undergoing coalescence, consolidation, and organization, and ultimately showing features of fibrosis. In this article, we review the computed tomography features of COVID-19 infection. Familiarity with these findings and their evolution will help radiologists recognize potential COVID-19 and recognize the significant overlap with other causes of acute lung injury. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This narrative review evaluates the literature regarding the accuracy of these tests, and makes recommendations based on this literature. In brief, a negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test is insufficient to rule out COVID-19.

Within months of the first reported case in China, the virus has spread worldwide at an unprecedented rate. COVID-19 illustrates that the biomaterials community was engaged in significant research efforts against bacteria and fungi with relatively little effort devoted to viruses. Accordingly, biomaterials scientists and engineers will have to participate in multidisciplinary antiviral research over the coming years. Although tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have historically dominated the field of biomaterials, current research holds promise for providing transformative solutions to viral outbreaks. To facilitate collaboration, it is imperative to establish a mutual language and adequate understanding between clinicians, industry partners, and research scientists. In this article, clinical perspectives are shared to clearly define emerging healthcare needs that can be met by biomaterials solutions. Strategies and opportunities for novel biomaterials intervention spanning diagnostics, treatment strategies, vaccines, and virus-deactivating surface coatings are discussed. Ultimately this review serves as a call for the biomaterials community to become a leading contributor to the prevention and management of the current and future viral outbreaks. © 2020 The Authors.

This is a new situation for most stroke teams that often leads to uncertainty among physicians, nurses, and technicians who are in immediate contact with patients. The situation is made even more complicated by numerous new regulations and protocols that are released in rapid succession. Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols. One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them. It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation. We therefore strongly encourage other hospitals to adopt simulation training to prepare their medical teams for code strokes during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, we should not lose sight of the fact that COVID-19 will attack any cell type in the body expressing ACE2 - including human spermatozoa. These cells possess the entire repertoire of receptors (AT1R, AT2R, MAS) and ligand processing enzymes (ACE1 and ACE2) needed to support the angiotensin signalling cascade. The latter not only provides COVID-19 with a foothold on the sperm surface but may also promote integration, given the additional presence of a range of proteases (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS12, furin) capable of promoting viral fusion. This article reviews the roles played by these various cellular constituents in maintaining the vitality of human spermatozoa and their competence for fertilization. The reproductive consequences of a viral attack on these systems, in terms of fertility and the risk of sexual transmission, are currently unknown. However, we should be alive to the possibility that there may be reproductive consequences of COVID-19 infection in young males that go beyond their capacity to survive a viral attack. © 2020 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology","ACE2; COVID-19; male infertility; spermatozoa; TMPRSS2; viral fusion",,"32649023","Andrology",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089035739

Therefore, knowing the frequency and characteristics of these manifestations of COVID-19 is important for both clinicians and health policy makers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed. PubMed and Scopus databases and Google Scholar search engine were searched for published and unpublished preprint articles up to 10 April 2020. Original studies providing information on clinical digestive symptoms or biomarkers of liver function in patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. After quality appraisal, data were extracted. Prevalence data from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Overall, 67 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising a pooled population of 13 251 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were anorexia (10.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.2%-16.4%), diarrhea (8.4%, 95% CI = 6.2%-11.2%), and nausea (5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%), respectively. Decreased albumin levels (39.8%, 95% CI = 15.3%-70.8%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (22.8%, 95% CI = 18.1%-28.4%), and alanine aminotransferase (20.6%, 95% CI = 16.7%-25.1%) were common hepatic findings. After adjusting for preexisting gastrointestinal (5.9%) and liver diseases (4.2%), the most common gastrointestinal findings were diarrhea (8.7%, 95% CI = 5.4%-13.9%), anorexia (8.0%, 95% CI = 3.0%-19.8%), and nausea (5.1%, 95% CI = 2.2%-14.3%). Gastrointestinal and liver manifestations are not rare in patients with COVID-19, but their prevalence might be affected by preexisting diseases.

Despite the resurgences in positive cases after reopening businesses in May, the country is seeing a shift in mindset surrounding the pandemic as people have been eagerly trickling out from federally-mandated quarantine into restaurants, bars, and gyms across America. History can teach us about the past, and today’s pandemic is no exception. Without a vaccine available, three lessons from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic may arm us in our fight against COVID-19. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity to the second wave, highlighting the potential of passive immunity-based treatments like convalescent plasma and cell-based therapy. Second, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are unknown. Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality. Human behavior is the most important strategy for preventing the virus spread and we must adhere to proper precautions. This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology and treatment for COVID-19 and highlight similarities between past pandemics. By revisiting history, we hope to emphasize the importance of human behavior and innovative therapies as we wait for the development of a vaccine.

Clinically, three stages have been identified based on viral infection, pulmonary involvement with inflammation, and fibrosis. Moreover, low and high elastance phenotypes can be distinguished in mechanically ventilated patients, based on lung mechanics, ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, and CT scans; these two phenotypes have presumed differences in their underlying pathophysiology. Although essential for therapeutic guidance, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is poorly understood. Here, we systematically reviewed published case reports and case series in order to increase our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology by constructing a timeline and correlating histopathological findings with clinical stages of COVID-19. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, 42 articles reporting 198 individual cases were included in our analysis. In lung samples (n = 131 cases), we identified three main histological patterns: epithelial (n = 110, 85%), with reactive epithelial changes and DAD; vascular (n = 76, 59%) with microvascular damage, (micro)thrombi, and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia; and fibrotic (n = 28, 22%) with interstitial fibrosis. The epithelial and vascular patterns can present in all stages of symptomatic COVID-19, whereas the fibrotic pattern presents starting at ~3 weeks. Moreover, patients can present with more than one pattern, either simultaneously or consecutively. These findings are consistent with knowledge regarding clinical patterns of viral infection, development of hyperinflammation and hypercoagulability, and fibrosis. Close collaboration among medical staff is necessary in order to translate this knowledge and classification of pathophysiological mechanisms into clinical stages of disease in individual patients. Moreover, further research, including histopathological studies, is warranted in order to develop reliable, clinically relevant biomarkers by correlating these pathological findings with laboratory results and radiological findings, thus, increasing our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitating the move to precision medicine for treating patients. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.",,,,"Mod.

The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published.

Objectives: To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results: A total of 1189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n = 4) and China (n = 4). The most common type of publication were letters (n = 4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n = 8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n = 7), through one-to-one contact (n = 11), telephone (n = 6) or video conference (n = 5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n = 7) as well as patient counseling (n = 8). Conclusions: A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and/or other pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Pharmaceutical services; Pharmacists; Review",,,"Res.

Countries worldwide are implementing various preventive measures to contain the spread of the infection such as travel and trade restrictions, closure of educational institutions and shops, and some took more strict measures such as imposing curfew. WHO is emphasizing the importance of early detection of cases, contact tracing, risk communications, implementing multisectoral approach in order to combat COVID-19 infection. Countries should provide the public with accurate, transparent information about the local and global situation of this escalating infection. Much uncertainty still surrounds this viral infection, its modes of transmission and dynamics.

The present investigation explores the transmissibility of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using some suitable mathematical models such as (a) a simplified Bats-Hosts-Reservoir (Wuhan Seafood Market)-People (BHRP) transmission network model useful in mapping the spread of the novel COVID-19 from its source (may be bats) to humans, (b) a concise baseline model based on individual behavioral response and control measures taken to control the transmission of the novel COVID-19 and (c) an exponential and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models to predict the transmission of the pandemic on day-to-day basis. The basic Reproduction number (R0) (for the next generation matrix) was derived to estimate the transmission of the novel COVID-19 using the simplified BHRP transmission network model. The logic estimates that around 2.30 persons could be affected by the reservoir and around 3.58 persons could be affected by the community (individual person to community population). On the other hand, the concise model based on real-time time-dependent data, such as day-to-day number of tests, appreciates the initiatives (control measures) of the Chinese government to break the transmission chain of the pandemic in the capital city of Hubei province. Furthermore, the basic Reproduction number (R0) for India is reviewed to be in the range between 1.4 and 3.9 using the classical SIR model and thus, the transmission rate is the same as that of California and Washington. The review also outlines the epidemiological SIR model (based on real-time time-dependent data) which estimates about the equilibrium stage of t he pandemic by the last week of May, 2020. The predictions of the age-structured epidemiological SIR model could be more accurate if data such as day-to-day number of tests are correctly fed during evaluation of the results. The present investigation emphasizes over the need of effective implementation of mitigatory strategies such as social distancing to prevent the transmission of the SARS-CoV2 outbreak in India. © 2020 Eva Gupta and Nand Jee Kanu.","COVID-19; Model; Novel Coronavirus; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2; Transmission",,,"Rev.

There are more than 200 ongoing trials on different drugs or vaccines, but new medications may take until 2021 to develop. Defining the optimal number of patients to be included in a study is a considerable challenge in these interventional researches. Ethical considerations prompt researchers to minimize the number of patients included in a trial. This gains particular importance when the disease is rare or lethal which is particularly so in the case of COVID-19. It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed modalities for the treatment of diseases. These tools should be effective, yet efficient, for rapid testing of such treatments. Sequential analysis has not been frequently used in many clinical trials where it should have been used. None of the authors in published literature, as far as we know, used sequential analysis techniques to test potential drugs for COVID-19. In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s). published by informed UK Limited Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","clinical trials; COVID-19; Sequential analysis; treatment","clinical research; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based medicine; human; medical literature; methodology; Review; sample size; sequential analysis; sequential probability ratio test; statistical analysis; study design; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; drug development; global health; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; antivirus agent; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Discovery; Evidence-Based Medicine; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","32459574","Libyan J.

Patients with prolonged background inflammation can present aberrant inflammatory reactions, well recognized as the main factors that can result in death and probably sustained by a dysregulated uPA/uPAR system. SuPAR, the soluble form of uPAR, represents a biomarker of disease progression, and its levels correlate well with comorbidities associated with the death of patients with coronavirus. New drugs that regulate the uPA/uPAR system could help treat the severe complications of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (hCoVs), including pandemic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). A dysregulated uPA/uPAR system is present in several pathologies, including the comorbidities of patients with COVID-19.

Patients with cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities are typically prescribed with long-term medications. We reviewed the management of co-medications prescribed for CVDs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Areas covered: There is no specific contraindication or caution related to COVID-19 on the use of antihypertensives unless patients develop hypotension from septic shock where all antihypertensives should be discontinued or severe hypokalemia in which continuation of RAS inhibitors is not desired. The continuation of antiplatelet and statin in case of adverse CV event should be based on risk-benefit assessment. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving oral anticoagulants, particularly those who are critically ill, should be considered for substitution to parenteral anticoagulants. Expert opinion: An individualized approach to medication management among hospitalized patients with concurrent CVDs would seem prudent with attention paid to changes in clinical conditions and medications intended for COVID-19. The decision to change prescribed long-term medications should be entailed by close follow-up to check if a revision on the decision is needed, with resumption or a plan for resumption of any long-term medication before hospital discharge if it is discontinued during hospitalization for COVID-19, for continuity of care. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cardiovascular; COVID-19; drug-drug interaction; renin-angiotensin system; statin","anticoagulant agent; antihypertensive agent; adverse outcome; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; disease severity; drug withdrawal; heart failure; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; hypertension; hypokalemia; hypotension; medication therapy management; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; septic shock","32700573","Exp.

People of all age groups are also at risk. Healthcare providers have always been the professionals most exposed to the risk of contracting to any kind of infection due to the nature of their profession. Elective interventions have been postponed to give care of patients with COVID-19. However, some interventions cannot be delayed, such as trauma surgery, acute abdomen, and emergency endoscopies. To maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system, the protection of healthcare providers should be the top priority. On the other hand, patients, who need emergency healthcare, should also be provided with appropriate treatment. Healthcare professionals should choose a treatment method appropriately in the circumstances to protect themselves and their patients as much as possible.

Great progress has been made in the past decade, but access to specimens remains a major barrier for the development and evaluation of needed quality diagnostics. We present a sustainable model for a global network of country-owned biobanks with standardised methods for collection, characterisation, and archiving of specimens and pathogens to facilitate and accelerate diagnostics development and evaluation for COVID-19 and other diseases of epidemic potential. The biobanking network should be run on the guiding principles of transparency, equitable access, ethics, and respect for national laws that support country ownership and sustainability. Adapting the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits, sharing of specimens from national biobanks can be rewarded through mechanisms such as equitable access to diagnostics at negotiated prices.

Virtually all organs and biological systems suffer from this new coronavirus infection, either because the virus targets directly specific tissues or because of indirect effects. Endocrine diseases are not an exception and some of endocrine organs are at risk of direct or indirect lesion by COVID-19. Although there is still no evidence of higher predisposition to contract the infection in patients with diabetes and/or obesity, the coexistence of these conditions contributes to a worse prognosis because both conditions confer an impaired immunologic system. Cytokines storm can be amplified by these two latter conditions thereby leading to multisystemic failure and death. Glycaemic control has been demonstrated to be crucial to avoiding long hospital stays, ICU requirement and also prevention of excessive mortality. Endocrine treatment modifications as a consequence of COVID-19 infection are required in a proactive manner, in order to avoid decompensation and eventual hospital admission. This is the case of diabetes and adrenal insufficiency in which prompt increase of insulin dosage and substitutive adrenal steroids through adoption of the sick day’s rules should be warranted, as well as easy contact with the health care provider through telematic different modalities.

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. Method: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. Results: Most countries’ digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. Solutions: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). Conclusion: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics. We present a summary of predictive, preventive and personalized digital methods that could be deployed fast to help with the COVID-19 and future pandemics. © 2020, The Author(s).","Civic technology; COVID-19; Digital democracy platform; Digital epidemic control; Disease management; Global pandemic; Infection spread; Internet of things; Monitoring; Predictive preventive personalized medicine (3 PM / PPPM); Predictive, preventive and personalized digital healthcare; Professional network; Risk assessment; Smartphone apps; Social aspects; Social machines",,,"EPMA J.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088821437

Millions of people have contracted the virus and a significant number of them lost their lives, resulting in a tremendous social and economic shock across the globe. Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies. Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation. This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic. This commentary aims to summarise the existing literature in relation to the promising treatments currently under trial, the perils of falsified medications and medicine-related information and the role of pharmacists in taking a leading role in combating these parallel global emergencies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Misinformation; Pandemics; Pharmacists",,,"Res.

The mortality rate for critically ill patients is up to 60%, and, thus, reducing the disease severity and case mortality is a top priority. Currently, cytokine storms are considered as the major cause of critical illness and death due to COVID-19. After a systematical review of the literature, we propose that cross-reactive antibodies associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may actually be the cause of cytokine storms. It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development. If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID-19. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","ADE; antibody-dependent enhancement; coronavirus; cross-reactive antibody; cytokine storm; immunity; mTOR inhibitors; rapamycin",,"32410266","J.

Standard practises that have evolved to minimise the risks associated with tracheostomy must be comprehensively reviewed in light of the numerous potential episodes for aerosol generating procedures. We meet the urgent need for safe practise standards by presenting the experience of two major London teaching hospitals, and synthesise our findings into an evidence-based guideline for multidisciplinary care of the tracheostomy patient. Methods: This is a narrative review presenting the extensive experience of over 120 patients with tracheostomy, with a pragmatic analysis of currently available evidence for safe tracheostomy care in COVID-19 patients. Results: Tracheostomy care involves many potentially aerosol generating procedures which may pose a risk of viral transmission to staff and patients. We make a series of recommendations to ameliorate this risk through infection control strategies, equipment modification, and individualised decannulation protocols. In addition, we discuss the multidisciplinary collaboration that is absolutely fundamental to safe and effective practise. Conclusion: COVID-19 requires a radical rethink of many tenets of tracheostomy care, and controversy continues to exist regarding the optimal techniques to minimise risk to patients and healthcare workers. Safe practise requires a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach to infection control, weaning and decannulation, with integrated processes for continuous prospective data collection and audit. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID; Multidisciplinary; Novel coronavirus; Tracheostomy care",,,"Eur.

The related Basidiomycota Agaricus blazei Murill (AbM), Hericium erinaceus (HE), and Grifola frondosa (GF) have been shown to exert antimicrobial activity against viral agents, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and parasites in vitro and in vivo. Since the mechanism is immunomodulatory and not antibiotical, the mushrooms should be active against multi-drug resistant microbes as well. Moreover, since these Basidiomycota also have anti-inflammatory properties, they may be suited for treatment of the severe lung inflammation that often follows COVID-19 infection. An AbM-based mushroom extract (Andosan™), also containing HE and GF, has been shown to significantly reduce bacteraemia and increase survival in mice with pneumococcal sepsis, and to improve symptoms and quality of life in IBD patients via an anti-inflammatory effect. Hence, such mushroom extracts could have prophylactic or therapeutic effect against the pneumonic superinfection and severe lung inflammation that often complicates COVID-19 infection.

By pooling data from multiple studies that are similar, we can increase the ability to achieve sufficient power to determine effectiveness more quickly through meta-analysis. A scoping review of registered clinical trials using cell-based interventions for COVID-19 was conducted to identify candidate studies for meta-analysis that could support an accelerated regulatory review. ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched April 23, 2020. Trials were included if they utilized cell or cell-derived products to treat or prevent COVID-19. Fifty-four registered cellular therapy trials were identified and included for analysis. Studies of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs; 41 studies; 1129 subjects projected to receive cells) and natural killer (NK) cells (5 studies; 135 projected to received cells) were observed most commonly. A subset of studies are controlled (34 studies, or 63%), including 27 studies of MSCs and 3 of NK cells. While heterogeneity in study design exists, the cumulative projected enrolment of patients from similar studies appears sufficient to allow the detection of meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes such as mortality, admission to intensive care and need for mechanical ventilation by September 2020—sooner than any individual study could determine effectiveness. MSCs are the predominant cell type in registered trials for severe or critical COVID-19 and represent the most promising candidates for future meta-analysis. Sufficient pooled sample size to detect clinically important reductions in multiple outcomes, including mortality, is anticipated by September 2020, but may require accessing supplementary data to align outcome reporting. Regulatory approval, funding and implementation by cell manufacturing partners will be accelerated by our framework for rapid meta-analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Cellular therapy; Clinical trials; COVID-19; Mesenchymal stromal cells; Systematic review",,,"Transfus.

An improved understanding of risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes may shed some light on novel personalized approaches to optimize clinical care in vulnerable populations. Emerging trends in the United States suggest possibly higher mortality rates of COVID-19 among African Americans, although detailed epidemiological study data is pending. Sickle cell disease (SCD) disproportionately affects Black/African Americans in the United States as well as forebearers from sub-Saharan Africa, the Western Hemisphere (South America, the Caribbean, and Central America), and some Mediterranean countries. The carrier frequency for SCD is high among African Americans.

One of the main determining factors of the poor prognosis in these patients is the development of coagulopathy. Moreover, it is well known that assisted reproductive technology procedures confer a risk of thromboembolic complications. This commentary analyses specific aspects coexisting between the thrombotic risk described during virus infection and that reported in the context of assisted reproduction treatments. Based on known pathophysiological aspects of virus infection and of ovarian stimulation, there are common elements that deserve to be taken into account. In the present context, any risk of hyperstimulation should be avoided. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist triggering should be mandatory in high-responder patients and/or those with COVID-19 infection. In both cases, the cycle should be segmented. A proposal is made for the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin not only in those cases in which oocyte retrieval has been performed, but also in those in which cancellation has been decided. In addition, endometrial preparation for frozen-thawed embryo transfers should use the transdermal route in order to minimize the higher thrombotic risk associated with the oral route. © 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.",,,,"Reprod.

These were first isolated in humans as causal microorganisms responsible for common cold. The 2002–2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS epidemic (64 countries affected) caused by MERS-CoV showed their acute and fatal side. These two CoV infections killed thousands of patients infected worldwide. However, WHO has still reported the MERS case in December 2019 in middle-eastern country (Saudi Arabia), indicating the MERS epidemic has not ended completely yet. Although we have not yet understood completely these two CoV epidemics, a third most dangerous and severe CoV infection has been originated in the Wuhan city, Hubei district of China in December 2019. This CoV infection called COVID-19 or SARS-CoV2 infection has now spread to 210 countries and territories around the world.

For the surgical speciality, there have been changes to both elective and emergency practice. Concern regarding potential aerosolisation during invasive procedures have been raised – including the use of pneumoperitoneum to facilitate laparoscopy. The aim of this study is to systematically review the data available to date regarding the potential risk posed to theatre staff by laparoscopy. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only publications in peer-reviewed journals were considered. PubMed, Ovid Embase, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library were searched. The search period was between 1st January 1980 and 27th April 2020. Bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Results: 4209 records were identified, resulting in 9 unique studies being selected. The included studies examined viral DNA aerosoliation generated by electrosurgery and CO2 laser ablation, with one study examining viral DNA aerosolisation following laparoscopy. Each of these demonstrated that viral DNA (Hepatitis B Virus and Human Papilloma Virus) was detectable in the surgical smoke plume. Conclusion: The data and analysis reported in this study reflect the most up-to-date evidence available for the surgeon to assess risk towards healthcare staff. It was constrained by heterogeneity of reporting for several outcomes and lack of comparable studies. There is currently insufficient data to recommend open or a minimally invasive surgical approach with regard to theatre team safety in the COVID-19 era. © 2020 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland","COVID-19; Infectious disease transmission; Viruses",,,"Surgeon",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087988410

Results: Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86–96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22–30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23–44%], respectively). There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochran’s Q test (p &lt; 0.01) and Higgins I2 heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity). After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively). In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%. Conclusion: Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation. However, the specificity is low. In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic. Key Points: • Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Coronaviruses; Pneumonias; X-ray computed tomography",,,"Eur.

The sources of infection of novel coronavirus detected mainly from animals to humans or infected human to healthy human through respiratory droplets and long contact period are the most prominent way of transmission. Coronaviruses are structurally large-sized single-stranded RNA viruses. The capability of regular therapies is constantly fading away exactly in case of coronavirus due to the modification of new strain, which could be certainly due to speedyadaptation in a protein sequence. The scientist should understand the pandemic situation of virus infection, also as they ought to identify the newest pathway research to regulate the virus infection. Developing new and smart strategies for drugs already in the development pipeline or already exiting drug can be treating diseases in patients could be useful to fight against COVID-19. In the last few years, several new smart drug delivery approaches made the changeover from the laboratory development to clinical applications. At present technology, researchers provide effective and low toxicity drug delivery when compared with classical delivery. This approach will be a great opportunity for the scientist to work and update preclinical research of advance drug delivery systems to cloneable and convertible production to the human trial success rate.

The main characteristic of coronaviruses is a high mutation rate, resulting in possible changes in their pathogenicity, tissue tropism or in their host. Even though they have been known causes of disease for decades, they became interesting in the 21st century due to outbreaks of large epidemics in humans and causing serious economic losses in the animal production sector, primarily the pig industry. The outbreaks of the highest concern emerged in 2002 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ‒ SARS) and in 2012 (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome ‒ MERS). Both diseases are of animal origin, and manifested with severe pneumonia in humans and a lethality of 11% and 36%, respectively. Today we are confronted with one of the largest epidemics in the history of humankind, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is caused by a variant of the SARS coronavirus and transmitted through person to person contact, with no known animal vector. Until the time of press of this article the infection has been detected in over 4.8 million people and has been the cause of over 320,000 deaths. In Croatia, due to protective measures imposed by the National Civil Protection Headquarters, COVID-19 is still within linear case growth.

Due to the risk that food can also be a medium to cause virus diseases, the procedures in the food industry safety programs must be revised; and, to be more specific, to disinfect Covid-19. Some effective disinfectants that have been proved to inactivate the coronavirus are: chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, quaternary compound, ozone and UV-C (shortwave ultraviolet light). In this review, some treatments used to inactivate a virus, with an emphasis to the coronavirus family, and other influenza viruses, are reported. It has been concluded that the coronavirus could be inactivated using free chlorine solutions at 30 mg/L, sodium hypochlorite 0.25 %, or Chlorine Dioxide (99% purity) diluted at 1/2.5 relation. Also, alcohol is an effective disinfectant at concentrations of 62 to 71% of ethanol. With respect to the use of the quaternary compound, it can be used at concentrations of 0.10%. Ozone is another promising disinfectant to inactivate the coronavirus and Covid-19. Doses of ozone between 10 to 20 ppm for 10 to 15 minutes are recommended to inactivate the coronavirus with 3.5 log10 reductions. However, a warning should be reported to the use of high doses of exposure because it can be a risk to human health. UV-C can inactivate the coronavirus at a value of 67 J/m2 by 1 to 30 minutes of exposure. © 2020 All rights reserved.","COVID-19; Food safety; Hypochlorite; Ozone; SARS-CoV; Ultraviolet light; UV-C Radiation",,,"Scientia Agropecu.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087273029

Here, we addressed important questions such as do coronaviruses remain active on the inanimate surfaces? Do the types of inanimate surfaces affect the activity of coronaviruses? What are the most suitable ingredients that used to inactivate viruses? This review article addressed many of the works that were done in the previous periods on the survival of many viruses from the coronaviruses family on various surfaces such as steel, glass, plastic, Teflon, ceramic tiles, silicon rubber and stainless steel copper alloys, Al surface, sterile sponges, surgical gloves and sterile latex. The impacts of environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were presented and discussed. The most important active ingredients that can deactivate viruses on the surfaces were reported here.

Virus-carrying aerosols can penetrate the healthy human body and lungs, resulting in rapid transmission. For the first time, in this evidence-based article, the effects of different types of mouthwashes to reduce the viral load were investigated. Also, another aim of this essay is a reduction in viral load in patients with COVID-19 and prevention developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients. Methods: Related databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. The present study was performed according to the preferred cases for standard systematic reviews (PRISMA). Results: Five original studies in which the subject matter was directly evaluated were included. Different types of mouthwashes and viruses were investigated in this study. Conclusions: The antiviral mouthwashes play a certainly important role in reducing the viral load of the salivary virus. In the present study, this importance could be proved in two different aspects, that is, the use of mouthwash before dental procedures to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to the dental team and the use of this mouthwash in COVID-19 patients to help improve systemic problems associated with oral microbial flora. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to review the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The search strategy involved peer-reviewed studies published between 1st January and 11th February 2020 in Pubmed, Google scholar and China Knowledge Resource Integrated database. Publications identified were screened for their title and abstracts according to the eligibility criteria, and further shortlisted by full-text screening. Three independent reviewers extracted data from these studies, and studies were assessed for potential risk of bias. Studies comprising non-overlapping patient populations, were included for qualitative and quantitative synthesis of results. Pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for patient characteristics. Results: A total of 29 publications were selected after full-text review. This comprised of 18 case reports, three case series and eight cross-sectional studies on patients admitted from mid-December of 2019 to early February of 2020. A total of 533 adult patients with pooled median age of 56 (95% CI: 49–57) and a pooled prevalence of male of 60% (95% CI: 52–68%) were admitted to hospital at a pooled median of 7 days (95% CI: 7–7) post-onset of symptoms. The most common symptoms at admission were fever, cough and fatigue, with a pooled prevalence of 90% (95% CI: 81–97%), 58% (95% CI: 47–68%), and 50% (95% CI: 29–71%), respectively. Myalgia, shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea and sore throat were less common with pooled prevalence of 27% (95% CI: 20–36%), 25% (95% CI: 15–35%), 10% (95% CI: 7–13%), 8% (95% CI: 5–13%), and 7% (95% CI: 1–15%), respectively. ICU patients had a higher proportion of shortness of breath at presentation, as well as pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease and COPD, compared to non-ICU patients in 2 studies (n = 179).

Local hospitals and care facilities are turning to makers to print essential consumable parts, such as simple visors, while in the hardest hit areas, critical pieces of medical technology are being fabricated. While important and effective innovations are appearing almost daily, there are also some worrying trends towards hobbyists attempting manufacture of complex medical devices with little understanding of the clinical or scientific rationale behind their design.

A secondary aim was to briefly review the literature for the effectiveness of surgical masks, N-95 and FFP-3 respirators, and power air purifying respirators (PAPRs) in reducing transmission of respiratory viral infections to health care workers while performing tracheostomy. Recommendations are mainly derived from clinical case series/retrospective observational studies from the SARS 2003/2004 outbreaks or experimental evidence for effectiveness for N-95/FFP-3 respirators and PAPRs. Differences do occur due to lack of evidence for COVID-19 as to whether N-95 and FFP-3 respirators are sufficient, or PAPRs should be recommended for tracheostomy. We would recommend adopting a conservative (protective) approach for HCWs teams performing tracheostomies, by routinely utilizing additional PPE such as PAPRs. Recommendations for the timing of tracheostomy also varied, however, almost all recommend a period of delay.

Wild animal meat contamination and adulteration have become increasingly serious, particularly for highly cooked wild animal meats that are difficult to be detected. In this study, a highly specific polyclonal antibody targeting the cooked rat proteins was developed. The corresponding sandwich ELISA (swELISA) was developed and found highly sensitive and specific for cooked rat meat, while there are no cross-reactions to the cooked chicken, pork and beef meats. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be as low as 0.01 ug/L based OD values. The coefficient variation (CV) is 5% and 8% for intra and inter assays, respectively. The recovery efficiencies are between 90% and 110%. The sandwich ELISA can detect both raw and cooked rat meat and is also suitable for Swab test of rat contamination.

Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented.

As the current pandemic has affected countries socially and economically, the purpose of this bibliometric analysis is to provide a holistic review of the corona pandemic in the field of social sciences. This study aims to highlight significant, influential aspects, research streams, and themes. We have reviewed 395 journal articles related to coronavirus in the field of social sciences from 2003 to 2020. We have deployed 'biblioshiny' a web-interface of the 'bibliometrix 3.0' package of R-studio to conduct bibliometric analysis and visualization. In the field of social sciences, we have reported influential aspects of coronavirus literature. We have found that the 'Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report' is the top journal. The core article of coronavirus literature is 'Guidelines for preventing health-care-associated pneumonia'. The most commonly used word, in titles, abstracts, author's keywords, and keywords plus, is 'SARS'. Top affiliation is 'The University of Hong Kong'. Hong Kong is a leading country based on citations, and the USA is on top based on total publications. We have used a conceptual framework to identify potential research streams and themes in coronavirus literature. Four research streams are found by deploying a co-occurrence network. These research streams are 'Social and economic effects of epidemic disease', 'Infectious disease calamities and control', 'Outbreak of COVID 19,' and 'Infectious diseases and the role of international organizations'. Finally, a thematic map is used to provide a holistic understanding by dividing significant themes into basic or transversal, emerging or declining, motor, highly developed, but isolated themes. These themes and subthemes have proposed future directions and critical areas of research. © 2013 IEEE.","Bibliometric analysis; biblioshiny; conceptual structure; coronavirus; COVID survey; COVID-19; pandemic; r-studio; SARS; social sciences","Behavioral research; Disease control; Diseases; Maps; Bibliometric analysis; Biological science; Co-occurrence networks; Conceptual frameworks; Conceptual structures; Infectious disease; International organizations; Potential researches; Economic and social effects",,"IEEE Access",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089310056

This Viewpoint of infectious aerosols is intended to inform appropriate infection control measures to protect health-care workers. Studies of cough aerosols and of exhaled breath from patients with various respiratory infections have shown striking similarities in aerosol size distributions, with a predominance of pathogens in small particles (<5 μm). These are immediately respirable, suggesting the need for personal respiratory protection (respirators) for individuals in close proximity to patients with potentially virulent pathogens. There is no evidence that some pathogens are carried only in large droplets. Surgical masks might offer some respiratory protection from inhalation of infectious aerosols, but not as much as respirators. However, surgical masks worn by patients reduce exposures to infectious aerosols to health-care workers and other individuals. The variability of infectious aerosol production, with some so-called super-emitters producing much higher amounts of infectious aerosol than most, might help to explain the epidemiology of super-spreading. Airborne infection control measures are indicated for potentially lethal respiratory pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,"32717211","Lancet Respir.

TB is strongly associated with poverty and this risk is largely mediated by undernutrition in India. COVID-19 response related lockdown has resulted in an economic crisis which may double levels of poverty, has exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted TB services. These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32–44% of TB incidence in India. A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5–30 kg/m2. We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2–3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020. Disadvantaged social groups and those living in states with higher levels of poverty, under-nutrition,and migrant workers are at particular risk. We suggest enhanced rations including pulses through the public distribution system and direct cash transfers to the poor pending restoration of livelihoods. TB services should be resumed immediately with enhanced efforts at case detection including active case finding. To prevent deaths among TB detected within the national TB programme, systemic identification, referral and management of severe disease at notification should be considered. © 2020 Tuberculosis Association of India","Coronavirus; Impoverishment; Lockdown; Mortality; Perturbation; Tuberculosis epidemiology",,,"Indian J.

Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.

Further, microvascular thrombosis has recently been demonstrated in patients with COVID-19, and has been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of organ injury in this disease. In many of these conditions, microvascular thrombosis is accompanied by inflammation, an association referred to as thromboinflammation. In this review, we discuss endogenous regulatory mechanisms that prevent thrombosis in the microcirculation, experimental approaches to induce microvascular thrombi, and clinical conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis.

We have studied one of the most socially significant domains of Facebook content, high-involving social discussions, and specifically, male and female participation in it. Two cases were studied. The first one was a discussion about ecology issues launched by Greta Thunberg and held in part in the Ukrainian Facebook community. The second one laid in the discussion about COVID-19 and quarantine launched by Ukrainian authority. Message analysis was applied for the precise detection of discourse peculiarities of male and female content datasets. Two different gender models of such discussions were distinguished. In the first one, the total shares of different attitudes to the discussion topic are similar or almost equal in female and male зщіеі samples. In the second one, these shares differ significantly. Therefore, in both models, men and women use very different messages to support the expressed attitude. It was proved that some gender-specific messages may be attributed to the psychological peculiarities of genders, but others may be explained only by the influence of gender stereotypes. For example, women are less probably to address politics, conspiracy theories, and scientific arguments in these discussions. Possible explanations of these two models were discussed.

Malpositioning and potential airway compromise occurs in more than half of placements. Vision-guided insertion can improve placement. In this article we propose the development of a 3rd generation supraglottic airway device, equipped with cameras and fiberoptic illumination, to visualise insertion of the device, enable immediate manoeuvres to optimise SAD position, verify whether correct 1st and 2nd seals are achieved and check whether size selected is appropriate. We do not provide technical details of such a ‘3rd generation’ device, but rather present a theoretical analysis of its desirable properties, which are essential to overcome the remaining limitations of current 1st and 2nd generation devices. We also recommend that this further milestone improvement, i.e. ability to place the SAD accurately under direct vision, be eligible for the moniker ‘3rd generation’. Blind insertion of SADs should become the exception and we anticipate, as in other domains such as central venous cannulation and nerve block insertions, vision-guided placement becoming the gold standard. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Anaesthesia; Complications; COVID-19; Positioning; Supraglottic airway device",,,"J.

Expert opinion: Artificial intelligence and systems biology offer the opportunity to avoid the inefficiencies and failures that arise in the classical vaccine development pipeline. One promising solution is the combination of both methodologies in a multiscale perspective through an accurate pipeline. We are entering an ‘in silico era’ in which scientific partnerships, including a more and more increasing creation of an ‘ecosystem’ of collaboration and multidisciplinary approach, are relevant for addressing the long and risky road of vaccine discovery and development.

This study aims to describe progress toward the framework’s goals, setbacks and strategies to update its articles to optimize outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: A review of relevant literature, including papers in this special issue, forms the basis for identifying steps necessary to amplify the impact of the FCTC. Findings: The WHO suggests that there are 1.3 billion users of tobacco globally. The expected deaths associated with tobacco use could be dramatically reduced by hundreds of millions between now and 2060 through measures that improve cessation and harm reduction support among adults. Additional steps needed to achieve the goals of the FCTC include developing new initiatives to address areas of profound neglect (for example, women); investing in global research and innovation; addressing the needs of vulnerable populations; and establishing a mechanism to fund priority actions required by low- and middle-income countries, including support for alternative livelihoods for smallholder farmers. Practical implications: In November 2020, the WHO FCTC Parties will host their next Conference of the Parties (COP9) in the Netherlands. This paper aims to contribute to the needed policy decisions related to this meeting. Since acceptance of this article, the WHO FCTC team announced that doe to the COVID-19 pandemic COP9 has been rescheduled till November 2021. Originality/value: There exists a need to prioritize the goals of tobacco control and offer clear strategies for its execution. This paper fills this niche via a thorough and up-to-date analysis of how to amend and enforce the FCTC. © 2020, Derek Yach.","Cessation; COP9; FCTC; Public health; Tobacco; WHO",,,"Drugs Alcohol Today",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085012396

The capacity of the virus to destroy the host cell by liberating its own DNA or RNA and replicating inside the host cell poses challenges in the development of antiviral therapeutics. In recent years, many new technologies have been explored for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections. Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising technologies on account of its ability to deal with viral diseases in an effective manner, addressing the limitations of traditional antiviral medicines. It has not only helped us to overcome problems related to solubility and toxicity of drugs, but also imparted unique properties to drugs, which in turn has increased their potency and selectivity toward viral cells against the host cells. The initial part of the paper focuses on some important proteins of influenza, Ebola, HIV, herpes, Zika, dengue, and corona virus and those of the host cells important for their entry and replication into the host cells. This is followed by different types of nanomaterials which have served as delivery vehicles for the antiviral drugs. It includes various lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid–polymer hybrid–based, carbon-based, inorganic metal–based, surface-modified, and stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials and their application in antiviral therapeutics. The authors also highlight newer promising treatment approaches like nanotraps, nanorobots, nanobubbles, nanofibers, nanodiamonds, nanovaccines, and mathematical modeling for the future. The paper has been updated with the recent developments in nanotechnology-based approaches in view of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.

The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals. © 2020 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","anthropogenic land-use change; deforestation; epidemic; global change; mammals; urbanisation; zoonotic diseases",,,"Mammal Rev.",Review,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085747918

The outbreak, confirmed on the New Year's Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating. Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission. The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called 'super-spreading events' emerge with time. Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host. India is responding swiftly to the emergency situation, and the whole of the country is under lockdown since 25 March 2020, to ensure social distancing. All the international flights are padlocked and the travellers are being screened at airports and seaports via thermal sensors, and quarantine for a period of 14 days is recommended. Three hundred and forty-five patients across the country tested positive with six fatalities as of 22 March 2020. No specific anti-CoV drugs are currently available. Patients are being treated with protease drugs are inhibitors, remdesivir, chloroquine, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors, ivermectin, sarilumab and tocilizumab, though none of these is Food and Drug Administration approved and are undergoing trials. Preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, cough etiquettes, proper hand washing, cleaning and decontaminating the surfaces are the mainstay for curbing the transmission of this virus. The present review highlights the update of novel SARS-CoV-2 in context to the Indian scenario. © 2020 Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; Bats; Hand hygiene; Quarantine; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; SARS-CoV-2; Social distancing; Wuhan","chloroquine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; envelope protein; ivermectin; matrix protein; nonstructural protein 1; nucleocapsid protein; remdesivir; RNA directed RNA polymerase; sarilumab; tocilizumab; variant surface glycoprotein; awareness; cardiovascular disease; cleaning; Coronaviridae; coronavirus disease 2019; decontamination; disease carrier; disease transmission; extreme environment; food safety; hand washing; human; immunocompromised patient; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Nidovirales; nonhuman; quarantine; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; RNA virus; screening test; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single-stranded RNA virus; social distance; virus cell interaction; virus morphology; virus pathogenesis; virus transmission; World Health Organization; zoonosis; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; pandemic; ultrastructure; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; World Health Organization","32436867","Indian J.
